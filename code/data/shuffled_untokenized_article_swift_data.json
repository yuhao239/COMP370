(Photo by Sascha Schuermann / AFP) (Photo by SASCHA SCHUERMANN/AFP via Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift has maintained her very significant presence on Spotify ever since her music reappeared on the platform a few years ago. Now, the accomplished singer-songwriter has made history on the streaming giant, with even Spotify itself celebrating her latest achievement./nIn a recent announcement on its social media platforms, Spotify proudly shared that Swift has officially become the first woman to amass an astounding 100 million monthly active listeners. This impressive feat means that over the course of the last month, a staggering 100 million distinct individuals from all parts of the globe have tuned in to enjoy at least one of the superstar's tracks./nWhile Swift may be the first woman to hit this remarkable milestone on the world's largest streaming platform, it's worth noting that, when considering all artists, she ranks second./nEarlier this year, The Weeknd secured the distinction of being the first musician to surpass the 100 million monthly listeners mark. In February, the Canadian pop and R&B sensation accomplished this groundbreaking feat, setting a new standard for streaming accomplishments. He now claims just under 110 million monthly listeners./nNumerous factors are currently contributing to Swift's exceptional performance on Spotify. The artist has always had a knack for attracting listeners, but August has proven to be particularly fruitful. Her most recent album, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), which was released just a month ago, continues to enjoy robust streams. Additionally, her track \"Cruel Summer,\" from the 2019 album Lover, is currently among the platform's most-played songs./nMeanwhile, anticipation for the re-release of her earlier album 1989 this fall has sparked renewed interest in the original version as well. Some casual fans may be busy returning to that collection following her announcement that she\u2019s re-recording it, as many of the songs featured on it have jumped in consumption./nAll of these events are helping Swift\u2019s performance on Spotify, but it\u2019s important to note that what\u2019s most impressive is the fact that her music is reaching a larger audience than ever. The 100 million number being reported doesn\u2019t specifically focus on those playing one tune and moving on or super fans streaming everything she\u2019s released\u2014it\u2019s simply about the number of people tuning in. Her reach is expanding, and that\u2019s impressive, considering how popular she has been for so many years./n"

Those who didn\u2019t catch Swift along her lauded trek now have a chance to witness all the action when the movie version of the tour premieres on October 13. While we eagerly wait for the movie, check out five things we can expect from the release below. /n[RELATED: 7 of Taylor Swift\u2019s Favorite Songs]/nSince we know which shows were filmed for use in the movie, we have a short list of which surprise songs could appear on the big screen. The first three of six shows in Los Angeles were captured for the concert film. Among the options from those shows are \u201cI Can See You,\u201d \u201cMaroon,\u201d \u201cOur Song,\u201d \u201cYou Are in Love,\u201d \u201cDeath by a Thousand Cuts,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re on Your Own, Kid.\u201d It\u2019s a stacked list. Any way you cut it, the Swifties will be pleased. /nHAIM was one of the featured opening acts for Swift\u2019s Los Angeles shows. Each night of her six-night stand, the trio joined Swift for a rendition of their evermore collaboration, \u201cno body, no crime.\u201d If you had FOMO over missing Swift and HAIM ham it up on stage together, fret not. One of their performances will likely be featured in the movie. /nWhile much of the Eras Tour is focused on Swift\u2019s upbeat anthems, there are a few emotional moments throughout. From \u201cchampagne problems\u201d to \u201cmarjorie,\u201d there is a good chance some tears could be shed. Swift herself has gotten emotional over the course of the tour performing those songs. We can only imagine how affecting they will be in high def. /nJust a few days after the release of the movie, Swift will share 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). The hype for her latest re-recording project will likely only grow after watching Swift perform cuts from the blockbuster record. Across the setlist, Swift plays \u201cBlank Space,\u201d \u201cStyle,\u201d \u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cBad Blood,\u201d and \u201cWildest Dreams.\u201d The anthems are undisputed bangers and are guaranteed to get fans excited for the updated versions. /nThe Eras Tour movie doesn\u2019t abide by typical movie-going standards. There will be no silencing your phone or sitting quietly so as to not disturb your fellow audience members. Swift hopes the movie will be an extension of the actual tour. That means the seats will be packed with passionate fans, screaming at the top of their lungs in over-the-top outfits. If you aren\u2019t Swift\u2019s biggest fan, perhaps avoid your local theater for a few days, it will officially become Swiftie territory as of October 13. /nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)/n(Allen J.

    "content": "Thousands of spirited Swifties will descend on Los Angeles starting this weekend, for a six-night run of Taylor\u2019s ERAS tour at SoFi Stadium. The fans will bring with them millions of dollars in needed economic activity for Inglewood and the surrounding community./nThe only group unhappy about this? Self-interested hotel union Unite Here Local 11./nFor related news, see: Politicians urge Taylor Swift to postpone LA concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers/nIn a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times, the union called on Swift to postpone her show in \u201csolidarity\u201d with striking hotel workers. Several of the union\u2019s elected allies have predictably chimed in, arguing that Swift should respect the union\u2019s cause. Lieutenant\u00a0Governor Eleni Kounalakis was shameless enough to join the protest, despite having just seen Swift in Santa Clara the weekend prior./nNotably missing from the list of boycott endorsers: Inglewood Mayor James Butts, not to mention the countless small businesses and disappointed fans who would lose out if Swift skipped SoFi./nThe union\u2019s demand is an unusual one: Swift herself is not in the middle of a labor dispute. Indeed, Swift made news in recent days by awarding her road crew up to $100,000 each as a personal thank you for the hard work during the tour. She\u2019s also partnered with local\u00a0charitable\u00a0organizations on her tour stops, such as a food bank in Santa Clara./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more pro-worker perspective,\u00a0and seemingly one that Los Angeles would welcome to town./nBut according to Local 11\u2019s twisted logic, Swift is obligated to reschedule because her visiting fans will be staying at LA-area hotels, including some of the hotels where workers may currently be on strike. This selfish perspective is on-brand for Local 11, which in recent weeks has made news for deliberately disrupting a wedding and 4th of July tourism to advance its goals during the strike./nRelated Articles\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tMatt Fleming: Thank you, readers, for reading my columns\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tGiving thanks for all of our freedoms\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tHappy Thanksgiving: Political Cartoons\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tA Thanksgiving lesson from grateful and prepared American families\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tJudge Andrew Napolitano: No one should be thankful for the size and scope of government\t\t\n\nSet aside for a minute the flawed argument that the entire LA economy should suffer because of labor disputes at a handful of union properties. The fault for the ongoing strike lies with union leadership, not the hotels and certainly not the excited Taylor fans coming to Los Angeles. The union has stubbornly prolonged the dispute with demands that hotels support a Los Angeles ballot measure that would require them to house the homeless alongside paying guests./nWith a potential transformation of these hotels into makeshift homeless shelters,\u00a0good luck getting tourists to stay there for Taylor\u2019s next tour stop in Los Angeles./nFor related news, see: Eleni Kounalakis hypocritically calls for Taylor Swift to cancel shows after attending concert/nAlso on the list of demands is a new hotel tax of seven percent, which guests would pay into a trust fund controlled by the union. The union claims the money would go towards affordable housing, but the language of the fund gives it broad latitude to spend the money on \u201cother efforts\u201d as well./nAs of this writing, Swift seems poised to ignore the union\u2019s unreasonable demands, picking the local economy and thousands of fans over the tantrums of Kurt Peterson and his cronies at Local 11. The tour dates will no doubt be a success, and should also serve as a lesson to other celebrities and politicians who face a Local 11 call for a boycott: There\u2019s no harm in shaking off the unreasonable demands of Los Angeles labor unions./nMichael Saltsman is Executive Director at the Employment Policies Institute"

And how did she form these friendships? MailOnline takes a look at the stars who have formed Taylor's A-list circle./nYou belong up here with me:\u00a0Taylor Swift turned the latest Kansas City Chiefs game into a celeb spotting exercise as she invited a host of her A-list mates to cheer on her new boyfriend/nGame day: The Hollywood A-listers cheered on Kansas City Chiefs\u00a0Travis Kelce as his team won 23-20 to\u00a0New York Jets/nWhile it's not clear exactly when they first met, Taylor, 33, revealed she was friends with Gossip Girl star Blake Lively, 36, in 2015 when she shared a snap of the pair hanging out at the Warner Bros. Movie World theme park in Queensland during the Australian leg of Taylor's 1989 tour.\u00a0/nAt the time, Blake had been married to Ryan Reynolds, 46, for three years and they'd welcomed their first daughter James the year before./nBlake welcomed their second child, daughter Inez, in September 2016 and nearly three years later, the married pair secretly welcomed a third daughter named Betty in October 2019 but they did not reveal her name publicly at the time./nIt was not until the summer of 2020 that the parents gave Taylor the honor of revealing their daughter's moniker to the world through her song Betty./nThe hit was featured on her eighth studio album Folklore. Fans quickly put the pieces together after hearing the names of Blake and Ryan's other two daughters in the song./nRyan previously revealed that their children had no clue Taylor was famous after growing up with her in their lives.\u00a0/nHe admitted on Sirius XM:\u00a0'I think what's most exciting for them is that for the longest time they just thought Taylor's just like an aunt, like a friend of Mommy and Daddy that's very, very close, almost family./n'And then they went to a concert one day and were like, \"Ohhhhh, this isn't a hobby.\"'/nFun down under:\u00a0Taylor, 33, revealed she was friends with Gossip Girl star Blake Lively, 36, in 2015 when she shared a snap of the pair hanging out in Queensland/nDouble date: When Taylor met Blake she had been married to Ryan Reynolds (right) for three years and they'd welcomed their first daughter (Taylor is pictured with ex Tom Hiddleston)\u00a0/nIn an unlikely turn of events, Taylor became friends with Sophie Turner, 27, in 2019, who had then just tied the knot with her ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas.\u00a0/nThe\u00a0ladies bonded while sharing a sofa on The Graham Norton show, where Sophie was quizzed about her recent Vegas marriage to Joe and Taylor discussed her new single\u00a0Me!/nIn recent weeks, however, their friendship seems to have ramped up and\u00a0The Mail on Sunday understands that Tyalor has become an increasing support to the British actress after the end of her four-year marriage to Joe turned sour last month./nOf their alliance, a friend said: 'Taylor and Sophie may not have been seen together much over the years but there has been a friendship there. However, once Taylor realised what Sophie was going through she wanted to lend her a shoulder to cry on./n'Taylor isn't silly though. She is absolutely aware that if the two of them are seen together it will attract a lot of attention and a lot of column inches.

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift\u2019s fans were delighted on Wednesday (August 23) with the announcement that they can now hear a sneak peek of her re-recorded version of the hit track \"Look What You Made Me Do.\"/nThe preview of the electroclash tune makes its debut in the trailer for Amazon Prime Video\u2019s upcoming thriller series, Wilderness. The news was shared by the streamer, which put the inclusion of Swift\u2019s song front-and-center, almost mentioning the actual promotion of the show as a bonus./n\"Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version)\" is set to serve as the opening title song for the much-anticipated Amazon Prime Video series. According to a release shared by the company, the upcoming thriller is described as such:/n\u201cLiv becomes the actress starring in Will\u2019s bad dreams after she learns about his betrayal, and her heartbreak is swiftly followed by another emotion: fury. The couple embark on an American road trip Liv\u2019s fantasised about since she was little, from the Grand Canyon on through Yosemite, before ending up with a hedonistic weekend in Las Vegas. For Will, it\u2019s a chance to make amends; for Liv, it\u2019s a very different prospect\u2014a landscape where accidents happen all the time. The perfect place to get revenge. Look what he made her do\u2026\u201d/nFans can hear the first taste of the updated take of \"Look What You Made Me Do\u201d on now, with the show premiering on September 15./nThis is not the first time that Swift has allowed one of her re-recordings to be used in this manner. In fact, it\u2019s not even the first time a tune from the future Reputation (Taylor\u2019s Version) has been utilized in such a manner. Earlier this month, her re-recorded rendition of \"Delicate,\" a popular single from her Reputation era, was featured in the latest season of Amazon Prime Video\u2019s The Summer I Turned Pretty./nThat move, which was not announced, was thrilling to fans watching the show. They caught the slightly altered take and the clip quickly went viral online, with many clamoring to hear even a snippet of the upcoming Reputation (Taylor\u2019s Version)./n\"Look What You Made Me Do\" was a fast chart-topper when it was originally released back in 2017. The tune went right to No. 1 on the Hot 100, giving the singer her fifth leader, at the time./nAs the lead single from her Reputation album, the track signified a significant shift in Swift's musical direction. Infused with darker tones and more electronic elements, the song ventured into new territories while retaining Swift's signature lyrical prowess. The smash\u2019s thematic depth focused on Swift's experiences with media scrutiny, fame and even her public conflicts, notably including her feud with Kanye West./nThe strategic incorporation of songs from the re-recorded version of Reputation, soon to be titled Reputation (Taylor's Version), into visual projects raises tantalizing speculations about the impending album release. Despite this thrilling prospect, fans will need to exercise a bit of patience before they can savor the full collection of re-recorded gems./nWhile she may be teasing Reputation (Taylor's Version), it\u2019s not likely that the album is coming soon, as Swift has already announced her next project. During a recent stop on her The Eras Tour, the star confirmed that the next of her albums to receive the re-recording treatment will be 1989, and it will be available in late October./n"

But Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 are cultural forces whose tours continue breaking records./nBy Eduardo Medina/nGannett, the largest newspaper chain in the United States, has announced that it would hire reporters to cover two of the biggest names in music: Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9./nAmid the zeal around both artists\u2019 record-breaking tours this year, Gannett said in separate announcements on Tuesday and Wednesday that it was looking for two reporters who could capture the significance of their music, their growing legacies and the effect both women have had across the music world./nThe two reporters would be writing for USA Today and The Tennessean, the publisher\u2019s newspaper in Nashville, where Swift began her career as a country darling before selling out stadiums across North America on her record-breaking Eras Tour./nIn its job description for the Beyonc\u00e9 reporting job, Gannett said on Wednesday that it was seeking a journalist who could cover how the \u201cinternational superstar and icon\u2019s impact is felt across generations,\u201d and how she has been \u201ca force in everything from how the country views race to how women think about their partners.\u201d/nGannett said on Tuesday that the reporter covering Swift would have to \u201cidentify why the pop star\u2019s influence only expands, what her fan base stands for in pop culture.\u201d/nThe jobs reflect the frenzied fandom that has surrounded both Swift and Beyonc\u00e9, who is also currently touring across the world./nSwift\u2019s cultural resonance seems to deepen with each album, including the re-recordings of her old music. Her fans have spent thousands of dollars on concert tickets and shook the ground so hard at one concert that it registered as an earthquake on a seismometer near Seattle./nAt Beyonc\u00e9 shows, fans dress up in attire inspired by cosmic cowboys and cowgirls, filling up stadiums in silver and glittery hats and boots. They follow her subtle cues, seas of people going silent as she sings the line \u201cLook around everybody on mute,\u201d from the 2022 song \u201cEnergy,\u201d and have held up blue balloons to celebrate performances by her daughter Blue Ivy Carter.

Although Swift, 33, and her promoters do not publicly report box-office figures, the trade publication Pollstar estimates that she has been selling about $14 million in tickets each night. By the end of her planned world tour, which is booked with 146 stadium dates well into 2024, Swift\u2019s sales could reach $1.4 billion or more \u2014 exceeding Elton John\u2019s $939 million for his multiyear farewell tour, the current record-holder./nSome journalists expressed concern about Gannett\u2019s reporting priorities. Last December, Gannett cut about 6 percent of the company\u2019s roughly 3,440-person U.S. media division. Media analysts said the move could worsen the state of the local news industry, which has shrunk in recent years, creating information deserts in communities across the country./nLaura D. Testino, a reporter for Chalkbeat Tennessee, said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that while Nashville is getting a Swift reporter, \u201cMemphis is still without an investigative reporter.\u201d/nGannett has hired 225 journalists since March and now has more than 100 open roles, Ms. Roberts said./nRobert Thompson, the director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, said on Tuesday that hiring for such specific beats \u201cis not as absurd as it looks at first glance.\u201d/nIn an increasingly fragmented cultural environment, \u201cwhere mass culture has broken up into a million little pieces,\u201d he said, there is an increased value to the one thing that emerges that essentially everyone can comment on./n\u201cYou cannot be conscious in the United States without on some level having to come to grips with Taylor Swift,\u201d Dr. Thompson said.

(Photo by John Shearer/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nIt\u2019s been assumed for years now that CDs are all but a dead format in America. While the shiny plastic discs have been making something of a comeback lately, they are still nowhere near as popular as they used to be. In a surprising twist, Taylor Swift\u2019s new album was so successful on CD that it defies a years-long downward trend and highlights her immense popularity./nSwift\u2019s just-dropped 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) opens at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 this week with the largest opening sum of 2023\u2014and also of her career. The set starts atop the ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. with more than 1.6 million equivalent units shifted, including both sales and streams./nIncluded in that massive figure are 554,000 copies sold on CD. That number is so large that if 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) had only been released on CD, it still would have gone to No. 1 on the Billboard 200. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t have faced any real competition, despite the fact that millions of Americans\u2013including some superfans of the singer\u2013might not even have a way to play a CD any longer./nThis week, the No. 2 title on the Billboard 200, Seventeen\u2019s Seventeenth Heaven, arrives with 100,000 equivalent units. That number is comprised almost entirely of pure sales, but not entirely. Swift\u2019s 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) sold more than five times that figure on CD alone./nBillboard notes that 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) earns the largest sales week on CD in more than seven years. The last title to sell more copies on the format in America in a single tracking frame was Adele\u2019s 25. That blockbuster sold 1.03 million copies on CD in a week at the end of 2015, a few farmes after it had been released./nHelping Swift sell as many copies of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) on CD as she did were the many different editions she offered. These days, many die-hard followers of a musician opt to buy a CD not as a means to hear the music, but rather as a collectible. Smart artists like Swift have leaned into this, producing several options with differing covers, tracklists, and the like./n"

    "content": "Could Taylor Swift\u2019s mega-tour have fans seeing red on their next COVID test?/nThere has been some cautious optimism among public health officials that this summer might be the first during which California doesn\u2019t experience a major coronavirus wave \u2014 and there\u2019s no evidence at this point that one is on the way. /nBut California is not in the clear or out of the woods just yet. Transmission does appear to be on the upswing, and there\u2019s no denying the virus\u2019 enduring power to spread, particularly in crowded settings. And crowded hardly begins to describe Swift\u2019s concerts, let alone the fan mania that has surrounded them. /n\u201cGiven the relatively low rate of COVID-19 community transmission, and the ability of everyone to take sensible precautions, we are hopeful the concerts will not significantly impact community transmission rates,\u201d the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times./n Music /nTaylor Swift kicked off six sold-out shows at SoFi Stadium, and The Times\u2019 Mikael Wood and Suzy Exposito were there to provide a full rundown./nAug. 3, 2023/nThere have been a handful of reports of coronavirus infections after Swift\u2019s concerts at the outdoor Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara and elsewhere in recent weeks. But it\u2019s unclear whether those played any more significant a role in terms of spread than other social gatherings or large events, such as the recent San Diego Comic-Con./nThe L.A. County Department of Public Health said it has not heard of other areas that have reported a notable increase in coronavirus transmission linked to Swift\u2019s previous stops. Her tour began in March and continued amid a national downturn in COVID hospitalizations \u2014 which hit a record low in late June before ticking back upward./nBut at this point, with coronavirus case reporting uneven and largely unreliable, it would be difficult if not impossible to definitively say whether a specific event like the Swift concerts was a major factor behind an uptick in local transmission, according to the Santa Clara County Department of Public Health. /nIn general, though, coronavirus levels in wastewater have already been increasing in both Santa Clara County \u2014 Northern California\u2019s most populous \u2014 and L.A. County, even before Swift\u2019s arrival. Reports of COVID-19 hospitalizations and emergency department visits have also started to climb slightly in L.A. County. /n Science & Medicine /nTest positivity has ticked up in L.A. County in recent weeks, though we\u2019re still well below peak COVID levels. If you get COVID now, here\u2019s how to treat it, how long to isolate, how to get Paxlovid, and more information on getting healthy./nJuly 28, 2023/nWith COVID once more on the rise, experts say that concert attendees should not be completely surprised if they do fall ill afterward./n\u201cPeople have to be aware that it\u2019s a potential venue [for infection], and riskier than most venues, given all the shouting, the singing, the fact that it\u2019s three hours \u2014 even though it\u2019s outdoors,\u201d said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious-disease expert. \u201cYou\u2019re just bringing people together from lots of different places ... people are traveling all over the country to the city where they can get tickets. So it\u2019s like a mega airport, or a mega transportation site, if you think about it.\u201d /nBeing at a concert in a stadium environment, even outdoors, could potentially carry a higher risk of infection than being inside a supermarket or an airport because, at a concert, there\u2019s a lot of \u201cshouting and screaming,\u201d he added./nL.A. County health officials said coronavirus transmission is possible during Swift\u2019s six-day slate of local concerts, the first of which was Thursday. But they noted that, \u201cfortunately, SoFi Stadium\u2019s indoor-outdoor design can increase air circulation in most parts of the stadium, which we know helps reduce transmission.\u201d /nThere is a fixed roof at the Inglewood venue, but its edges are open to the outdoors, letting in ocean breezes./n Science & Medicine /nIt\u2019s 2023 and you just tested positive for COVID-19. Now what? The latest CDC protocols, isolation recommendations, ways to treat it and ways to prevent long COVID./nMarch 24, 2023/nTo be clear, the COVID-19 landscape this summer is generally far less dangerous than previously in the pandemic, with most people having a degree of immunity \u2014 from vaccinations, previous infection or a combination of the two. There\u2019s also wide availability of anti-COVID drugs such as Paxlovid. /nStill, it would be a mistake to be completely fearless of the disease: COVID-19 remains deadly to some. Elderly individuals continue to be at higher risk, especially if they are not up-to-date on their shots. There also still is some risk of contracting long COVID any time a person is infected. /nChin-Hong said he is not suggesting anyone cancel their concert plans, and noted that Swift has been \u201csuper responsible\u201d during the pandemic. In early 2021, as the deadliest COVID-19 surge hit the nation, Swift canceled a planned concert tour and said she \u201ccan\u2019t wait til we can all safely be at shows together again.\u201d/nStill, Chin-Hong said it\u2019s important to be aware that COVID-19 spread remains a possibility. And while masks may have largely gone  out of style, they can still play a helpful role, even if used sparingly. /n\u201cFirst of all, if you\u2019re at high risk, you still could go \u2014 it\u2019s still outdoors ... but you might want to mask if you\u2019re immune-compromised,\u201d Chin-Hong said. And for those who aren\u2019t going to mask in the stands, some ways to reduce risk would be to wear a mask in more cramped spaces, like when visiting concession stands, going to the restroom, or while aboard public transit. /n California /nCalifornia politicians have asked Taylor Swift to cancel her L.A. tour dates this week in solidarity with striking hotel workers. It\u2019s an impossible ask, but one the singer can\u2019t ignore./nAug. 3, 2023/nAnd if you do fall ill two or three days after the concert, \u201cyou should test. A lot of people are not testing anymore. But testing is important, so you can protect people\u201d by staying home and not spreading the infection to others, Chin-Hong said. Health officials say people who have COVID-19 need to stay home for at least five days after their first symptoms or their first positive test result, whichever came first. /nMost health plans are required under California law to reimburse insured patients for eight at-home COVID-19 tests per month, per covered person. /nIn addition, higher-risk people with COVID-19 should speak to their healthcare provider about getting prescribed an anti-COVID drug such as Paxlovid, which reduces the risk of severe illness and death and may lower the risk of developing long COVID. Paxlovid is provided to patients for free. /nPaxlovid is often prescribed for people 50 and older, but it can also be prescribed to people who are younger and have no major medical problems./n California /nNew study suggests that people with a specific version of a particular gene who got COVID were far more likely to experience an asymptomatic infection./nJuly 19, 2023/nEvery county in California is reporting a \u201clow\u201d COVID-19 hospital admission rate, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Based on that level, the L.A. County Department of Public Health says that for the general public, masking is up to a person\u2019s individual preference, but the agency still recommends masking in places such as public transit and transportation hubs. /nCOVID-19 hospitalizations nationwide are among their lowest levels since the pandemic began but have started to tick upward. Nationally, there were 8,035 new COVID-19 hospitalizations for the week that ended July 22, up 12% from the prior week. In California, the comparable number is 1,366, also up 12% from the prior week. /nCalifornians who don\u2019t have insurance or are having a hard time getting a prescription for anti-COVID medication can make a free phone or video appointment through the state\u2019s COVID-19 telehealth service, reachable through sesamecare.com/covidca or by calling (833) 686-5051./nL.A. County has similar free telehealth services, which are accessible at (833) 540-0473. Free at-home COVID tests also can still be picked up at county libraries and vaccination sites operated by the county Department of Public Health, as well as at many food banks and senior centers./nStart your day right/nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

[+] performs onstage during NSAI 2022 Nashville Songwriter Awards at Ryman Auditorium on September 20, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by Terry Wyatt/Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift rules the Hot 100 this week with her new single \"Is It Over Yet?\" The tune debuts atop the ranking of the most-consumed songs in America, taking over from another one of the singer's smashes, \"Cruel Summer,\" which had led the chart for two frames prior. With another leader to her name, Swift advances again on the list of the most successful female artists of all time./n\"Is It Over Yet?\" marks Swift's eleventh No. 1 hit on the Hot 100. She is now tied with Whitney Houston for the fourth-most leaders among solo female artists when looking at who has landed the most chart-toppers. Last week, before \"Is It Over Yet?\" arrived, Swift was on the same level as Janet Jackson. Now, she's passed that superstar, likely for good./nAhead of Swift, when looking only at solo female superstars, are three other women. Mariah Carey claims the most No. 1 hits ever among females, with 19. She's followed by Rihanna, with 14, and Madonna, with 12. Including all women, The Supremes also landed a dozen winners during their time together./nWhen all artists are included in this roundup, the ranking changes, but Swift is still climbing. The Beatles have charted the most No. 1 hits in U.S. history, with 20. Drake and Michael Jackson are tied with 13 each, and of course, all the aforementioned women rank above her for the moment./n\"Is It Over Yet?\" marks Swift's third No. 1 hit of 2023. She saw her 2022 smash \"Anti-Hero\" return to the highest space on the Hot 100 early in the year. After weeks of trying, she pushed \"Cruel Summer\" to the top spot four years after it was first released./nThe new No. 1 on the Hot 100 is featured on Swift\u2019s just-released album 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). That set, a re-recorded edition of the original 1989, also opens at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with the largest sum of her career./n"

A blond wig. A bottle of blue Gatorade./nMs. Hartley, 31, and Mr. Tighe, 35, who live in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., hand-painted a white jacket and jeans to resemble the denim set worn by Travis Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs who is rumored to be dating Ms. Swift./nMs. Hartley expects Halloween parties to be packed with doppelg\u00e4ngers of the couple. \u201cI think it would be so hilarious to see 10 Taylor Swifts and 10 Travis Kelces in a room,\u201d she said./nAt the height of Barbiemania this summer, it appeared that Barbie and Ken would be the dominant couples\u2019 costume of Halloween. This week, SAG-AFTRA discouraged its members from dressing up as characters from major movie studios in solidarity with the continuing actors\u2019 strike./nAnd now an October surprise may have arrived in the form of Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce. Social media is dotted with couples posing in red No. 87 jerseys and sequined leotards more than a week before Halloween./n\u201cThank you, Travis and Taylor, for giving boring straight white couples a 2nd Halloween costume,\u201d Lucas Johnson wrote on X, formerly Twitter. (Ms. Hartley said she thinks any couple could pull off the look.)/nSmall online retailers say that requests for the costumes \u2014 with delivery by Oct. 31 \u2014 are surging./n\u201cI\u2019m up until 3 or 4 in the morning every night, customizing bodysuits,\u201d said Angela George, 40, who lives in Portland, Ore., and sells clothing on Etsy. Already this month, she said, she has sold more than 300 pieces inspired by Ms. Swift, several to customers who said they intended to wear them for couples\u2019 Halloween costume contests./nEnthusiasm is not always so strong for couples\u2019 costumes, which an article in The New York Daily News once proclaimed \u201cthe worst part of Halloween.\u201d/nBut Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce have broad appeal, and convenient timing, working in their favor. The pairing represents a moment of alignment between two of the country\u2019s \u201cbiggest media entertainment entities,\u201d Nora Princiotti, a football writer for The Ringer, told The New York Times in an article earlier in October./nMany Swifties have leftover attire from dressing up to see the Eras Tour or its recent concert film, Ms. Hartley said. And reddish football jerseys are not exactly hard to come by. \u201cIt attracts sports people, it attracts non-sports people, it attracts Taylor Swift fans,\u201d Ms. Hartley said./nEven Mr. Kelce has found the N.F.L.\u2019s prime-time coverage of the couple to be a little bit overkill. But the pair\u2019s exposure was a plus for Richelle Terry, 31, an elementary school teacher in Houston who was looking for a recognizable costume./nEach year she and her husband dress up as whichever celebrity couple \u201cis the happening hashtag at that moment,\u201d she said. Last year her husband, Chase Terry, 37, shaved his head to be the Travis Barker to her Kourtney Kardashian. This year, he grew a mustache to evoke a different Travis./nHalloween costumes have evolved from a standard stock of characters (witches, ghosts) to looks that reflect the zeitgeist. Costumes based on TV shows, comic books and movies took off in the second half of the 20th century, thanks in part to costume companies that licensed characters like Spider-Man and Snow White./nSome shoppers now want costumes that make references to social media trends from the weeks leading up to Halloween. And because such looks are less likely to be available at large retailers like Spirit Halloween and Party City, some smaller sellers have sensed an opportunity./nStormy Kelly, 33, who lives in Miami, sells made-to-order costumes based on celebrities like Ms. Swift and Kylie Jenner through TikTok and Instagram. \u201cI can see a paparazzi photo and have the sample made by the next morning,\u201d she said. Her most intricate costumes can cost up to $2,000, but most sell for $200 to $300./nAbout half of her sales since the Eras Tour began in March have been inspired by Taylor Swift. \u201cI\u2019ve ditched the $50 bikinis I used to sell because these projects are so much more profitable,\u201d she said./nWhen Kayla Highley, 29, who lives in Fishers, Ind., added a red jersey that says \u201cTaylor\u2019s Boyfriend\u201d on the back to her Etsy shop in September, it quickly became her top-selling item. She said she had gotten about 15 inquiries in the past week asking if orders could be delivered before Halloween./nMs. Swift and Mr. Kelce have also made appearances in Halloween d\u00e9cor. In one setup that was widely shared on TikTok, a skeleton wearing a Kelce jersey proposes to a skeleton in a blond wig. The scene takes place in the front yard of a house, where the skeletons are surrounded by gravestones with the names of Ms. Swift\u2019s exes./nAn earlier version of this article misstated where Ashlee Hartley and Charlie Tighe live. It is Saratoga Springs, not Sarasota Springs./nHow we handle corrections/nCallie Holtermann reports on style and pop culture for The Times. More about Callie Holtermann/nAdvertisement"

But it is a cool-looking roof: dramatically swooping like the Jet  Age lines of LAX\u2019s Theme Building nearby. For any young star in L.A., that\u2019s quite a clip for your sizzle reel./nSince the $5-billion SoFi Stadium opened in 2020, it\u2019s seen the Rams win a hometown Super Bowl in 2022, and it will have a significant role in the 2028 Olympics. But in 2023, it\u2019s become the preeminent place to shoot blockbuster concert documentaries./n\u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d is the record-breaking leader of the pack, with an estimated opening weekend of $96 million. \u201cThe Weeknd: Live at SoFi Stadium\u201d hit Max in February; Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s coming Renaissance tour doc will have footage from a number of locations that will likely include SoFi, which hosted three Beyonc\u00e9 shows, including one on her birthday./n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming an identifiable place for music globally,\u201d said Christy Castillo Butcher, SoFi Stadium\u2019s senior  vice president of programming and booking. \u201cThe shots filmmakers can achieve here are gorgeous. It becomes another character in these films.\u201d/n2023  has been the year of the blowout stadium tour, with packed houses coast to coast and no Ticketmaster Verified Fan unscathed. The summer spectaculars coincided with the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, a new reason to make going to the movies a big, social occasion again. Pop artists and filmmakers  see potential for a banner year in concert documentaries./n\u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d will easily place among the year\u2019s top grossing films. One guest at Swift\u2019s doc premiere at the Grove last week? Beyonc\u00e9, who will debut her own \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9\u201d on Dec. 1. /n Movies /nThe pop phenomenon\u2019s concert film is an occasion for screaming, singing and dancing in the aisles. It also reveals an evolving Taylor Swift, exuding confidence./nOct. 12, 2023/nClassic live-music docs often have a sense of place and architecture beyond the stage. The main characters of 1970\u2019s \u201cWoodstock\u201d  are the waves of hippies on Max Yasgur\u2019s dairy farm in Bethel, N.Y.  D.A. Pennebaker\u2019s \u201cDepeche Mode 101\u201d filled Pasadena\u2019s sylvan Rose Bowl with every goth in the Southland (some of whom Pennebaker followed on a party bus into the show). In \u201cU2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky,\u201d the Irish rockers found a natural setting befitting their celestial aims./nThe still-gleaming SoFi doesn\u2019t have the same mystery of a Colorado sandstone crevasse, nor is it a technological marvel like the newly opened Sphere in Las Vegas. But when SoFi debuted to the public in 2020, fans noticed the surprising intimacy of it, as far as 70,000-capacity stadiums go. The main floor is built well below ground, and the vertical rake of the seats puts more fans closer to the action. The semi-enclosed roof adds some punctuation to the scene. If you\u2019re a performer, it creates more of a wall of bodies than a sea of them./nFor a filmmaker trying to lend intimacy to the biggest pop shows on the planet, that\u2019s an invaluable asset./n\u201cThere is a thoughtfulness at SoFi that really added architectural texture and class to the world of our film,\u201d said Micah Bickham,  director of \u201cThe Weeknd: Live at SoFi Stadium.\u201d \u201cRather than at an older stadium with a tremendous first section, SoFi has all these different levels; it\u2019s more of a cascading effect where the camera\u2019s almost climbing a wall.\u201d/nGiven its flagship industry \u2014 and proximity to the world\u2019s best film crews \u2014 L.A.  will always be a top location to shoot a concert documentary. (Talking Heads\u2019 1984 film, \u201cStop Making Sense,\u201d currently in re-release from A24, was shot at Hollywood\u2019s Pantages Theatre.) Tours often begin on the East Coast and wrap up on the West Coast, meaning that a show is a well-oiled machine by the time it arrives in L.A./nNFL Media headquarters is just across the street, but even for nonfootball events, it\u2019s still \u201cvery user friendly,\u201d Castillo-Butcher said. \u201cWe have an in-house broadcasting and digital team to work with tours and filmmakers. The infinity screen can put images of the artist up or just augment lighting. They can get shots of the LED roof, the park, exteriors, but never impede live experience./n\u201cIt\u2019s like the \u2018Today\u2019 show at Rockefeller Center [in New York]. It can be a studio all its own, where you wouldn\u2019t even know you\u2019re in a stadium.\u201d/n Music /nShe counts Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj as mentors, and quickly catapulted into the top tier of pop stars. Now, Ice Spice has her sights set on the Grammys./nOct. 12, 2023/nBickham, for one, might not have been able to pull off his doc without the massive film infrastructure already in place. The Weeknd\u2019s SoFi show included a confusing-at-the-time moment where he appeared alongside Lily-Rose Depp for a brief scripted scene. It would later appear in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Idol,\u201d where the Weeknd, a.k.a. Abel Tesfaye, played a scuzzy svengali to Rose-Depp\u2019s pop star./nThat scene was shot by \u201cThe Idol\u2019s\u201d director Sam Levinson. Having two separate film crews, with their own equipment and shot lists for entirely different projects, was a mind-bending undertaking during a live set with 70,000 people watching./n\u201cThe space was malleable enough that it didn\u2019t impede our film,\u201d Bickham said. \u201cSam and Abel and I met to establish that shot right before Abel takes the stage. We had one check-in to make space for both teams. That we were not buried in a cavernous tunnel of a decades old stadium was so helpful.\u201d/nBickham is close friends with Sam Wrench, the director of \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d  and while they didn\u2019t compare notes before going in to shoot their respective SoFi projects, they both appreciated the rare opportunities within the space./n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many places in the world where  you can create such scale and really allow the camera to enter the artist\u2019s world,\u201d Bickham said. \u201cHow do you create shots that feel massive in scale, yet have an intimacy within a film? SoFi is a venue with tremendous character, but it\u2019s kind of a blank canvas too.\u201d/nSoFi is too young to have much history yet. (The 2022 Super Bowl Halftime show, featuring locals Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar, paid homage to the landmarks of Compton just a few miles away.) But the venue will host 19 concerts in 2023 (the final being Travis Scott on Nov. 5). It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if more docs emerge from this gold rush year./nCastillo-Butcher, meanwhile, plans to turn off the part of her brain that knows SoFi as an office so she can join millions of others and just enjoy the \u201cEras\u201d doc\u2019s fireworks finale./n\u201cl\u2019ll have to watch it a few times, but I will get caught up in the fandom,\u201d she said. \u201cI was there every single night in August, and I was in awe.\u201d/nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

Three of the LP\u2019s singles \u2014 \u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cBlank Space\u201d and \u201cBad Blood\u201d \u2014 topped Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, while \u201cStyle\u201d and \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d both peaked inside the Top 10. And her world tour behind the album was a juggernaut known for surprise appearances by a wide array of celebrities including the Weeknd, Mick Jagger, Justin Timberlake, Selena Gomez, Aerosmith\u2019s Steven Tyler, Miranda Lambert, Ricky Martin and the late  Lakers star Kobe Bryant, who presented Swift with a banner at Staples Center marking her 16 sold-out shows at the downtown arena./nNearly a decade later, though, Swift\u2019s pop-cultural dominance has only grown: First revealed near the end of her sold-out six-show run at Inglewood\u2019s SoFi Stadium, \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d follows the first leg of her record-breaking Eras tour and an accompanying concert film currently in its second week as the biggest movie in America. It also arrives amid her endlessly scrutinized relationship with Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs and just as her song \u201cCruel Summer\u201d reached No. 1 four long years after it came out on 2019\u2019s \u201cLover.\u201d/n Movies /nThe pop phenomenon\u2019s concert film is an occasion for screaming, singing and dancing in the aisles. It also reveals an evolving Taylor Swift, exuding confidence./nOct. 12, 2023/nGiven that each of Swift\u2019s rerecorded albums \u2014 \u201cFearless (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d \u201cRed (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d \u2014 has debuted with successively higher sales-and-streaming numbers, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder whether \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d will make the biggest splash yet \u2014 and just before the Nov. 10 announcement of Grammy nominations in which her latest set of new songs, last year\u2019s \u201cMidnights,\u201d is widely expected to prevail./nLike the earlier Taylor\u2019s Versions, the new \u201c1989\u201d comes with freshly recorded tracks from Swift\u2019s so-called vault meant to entice consumers and bolster the singer\u2019s ever-expanding lore. Here are the five vault tracks from \u201c1989,\u201d ranked in order from worst to best:/n5. \u201cSlut!\u201d/nThis month, live music\u2019s other champion of 2023, Beyonc\u00e9, helped Swift drum up attention for the \u201cEras Tour\u201d movie when she showed up for a pair-of-queens photo opp at the film\u2019s premiere at the Grove. But if Tay and Bey have yet to formally collaborate on a song, this bleary synth-pop track about a risky romance suggests that Swift has been paying close attention to Beyonc\u00e9 for years: \u201cIf I\u2019m gonna be drunk, might as well be drunk in love,\u201d Swift sings, quoting the lead single from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s self-titled 2013 LP. Strong concept, so-so execution./n4. \u201cIs It Over Now?\u201d/n\u201cI think of jumping off of very tall somethings,\u201d Swift sings in this vivid account of a relationship doomed to failure \u2014 one for which she takes some blame but without enough of the self-flagellating wit that distinguishes \u201cAnti-Hero,\u201d her big hit from \u201cMidnights.\u201d Most quotable lyric: \u201cYour new girl is my clone.\u201d/n3. \u201cSay Don\u2019t Go\u201d/nOne of Swift\u2019s opening acts on the 1989 tour was Haim, the L.A. sister trio who\u2019ve continued to turn up on her albums and at her shows (and on her Instagram). With its booming retro-\u201980s drums and its shouted backing vocals, this throbbing pop-rock jam \u2014 which Swift co-wrote with the great Diane Warren \u2014 sounds like an outtake from Haim\u2019s 2013 debut, \u201cDays Are Gone.\u201d/n2. \u201cNow That We Don\u2019t Talk\u201d/nWidespread speculation about Swift\u2019s star-studded dating life kicked into high gear with 2010\u2019s \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d which contains what might be the finest breakup song in her catalog in the lacerating (and precisely John Mayer-approximating) \u201cDear John.\u201d But the people need to know whom she\u2019s referring to in this hilarious take-down of a dude she\u2019s elated to have kicked to the curb: \u201cI don\u2019t have to pretend I like acid rock / Or that I like to be on a mega-yacht / With important men who think important thoughts.\u201d/n1. \u201cSuburban Legends\u201d/nWith the possible exception of Drake, Taylor Swift is pop\u2019s most effective nurser of past grievances, and here \u2014 over a surging arena-disco groove that keeps accumulating emotional weight \u2014 she examines a fraught high-school reunion in one indelible image after another.

(Photo by Raymond Hall/GC Images)/nEarlier this month, Taylor Swift delighted her fans by announcing her plans to re-record and re-release her next album, the iconic 1989. This exciting revelation was made during the final U.S. stop on the current leg of her The Eras Tour./nEver since this announcement and the confirmation that the album will drop on October 27, fans have been diving back into the original tracks, streaming them with renewed enthusiasm. Now, one particular song from the album is surging on a significant Billboard chart, reaffirming that fans's love for it remains as strong as it was when it was first introduced./nThis week, Swift's single \"Style\" climbs the ranks on the Streaming Songs chart\u2014a weekly compilation of the most-streamed tracks in the United States. The infectious tune soars from its previous position at No. 50, where it sat last time around, to No. 40, making a notable leap of 10 spots in one go. This newfound prominence marks the song's highest standing in quite some time and indicates a promising future ahead for the beloved track./n\"Style\" isn't Swift\u2019s sole representation on the Streaming Songs chart. In fact, she has several of her compositions from various albums gracing the competitive ranking. \"Style\" itself follows behind \"Cruel Summer,\" which holds at its peak position of No. 5, along with \"Anti-Hero\" at No. 23 and \"Karma\" at No. 38. Astonishingly, \"Style\" is not even the only tune from 1989 on the chart either. \"Blank Space\" also makes its presence felt at No. 41, and is also steadily gaining traction./nSince the announcement of Swift's re-recorded version of 1989, the songs from the album have witnessed a huge surge in consumption. This phenomenon has translated into immediate gains on the Spotify charts, with many tracks from the Grammy-winning album experiencing a rejuvenated gain in streaming popularity. Clearly, both \"Style\" and \"Blank Space\" have resonated as favorites among the fans, and this momentum might continue to build in the forthcoming weeks./n\"Style\" was selected as the third official single from Swift's original 1989 album. The song was heavily promoted in early 2015 and eventually peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100 chart. Now, with its current resurgence, it's poised to potentially reach new heights, at least on the Streaming Songs tally, where it has thus far peaked just a few spaces above where it sits now./nIf this upward trajectory continues, it might even reappear on the Hot 100 chart, much like \"Blank Space\" has managed to do in the recent weeks./n"

(Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)/nIn less than two weeks, Drake will release his highly-anticipated new album For All The Dogs. The rapper has been teasing the collection for quite some time, and after some false starts, now it has a proper release date, and fans are excited to hear more from the superstar./nFor All The Dogs is bound to be another huge hit on the Billboard charts, and it will only serve to further cement Drake\u2019s lead over another one of the biggest names in music./nWhen For All The Dogs debuts, Drake will put more space between himself and Taylor Swift when it comes to the most Hot 100 hits. Drake leads the charge among all acts, but lately, Swift has been catching up thanks largely to the success of her many re-recorded albums. Her re-released sets have all produced a number of major wins on the Hot 100, and each year, she tacks on plenty of new smashes./nDrake does the same, but until recently, nobody was making a real play for his record. Now, he\u2019s looking to ensure he remains the top-performing star with the most placements on the competitive list./nWhen For All The Dogs arrives, the songs featured on the title will almost certainly enjoy splashy debuts on the Hot 100. It\u2019s not yet clear how many tracks will be on the title, but chances are most, if not all of them, will find their way to the ranking of the most-consumed tunes in the U.S./nCurrently, Drake has sent 298 songs to the Hot 100 throughout his career. That is dozens of hits in front of his closest competitor, Swift, who has already managed to place 212 tunes onto the tally. Drake will see his sum climb, though by how much is not yet clear./nIt could be just a few, or perhaps more than 20. The Canadian rapper has previously claimed more than 20% of the 100-spot Hot 100 in the past, and there\u2019s no reason to believe he won\u2019t be able to do so again./nSo far, Drake has only released one single from For All The Dogs, \u201cSearch & Rescue.\u201d The tune dropped in April, and at the time, it wasn\u2019t clear that it was fronting a new complete collection. The track opened and peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100, narrowly missing out on giving Drake another chart-topper. The hip-hop powerhouse hasn\u2019t shared any more music from For All The Dogs since then, but that won\u2019t stop the set from producing more hits once people can stream the title en masse./nOver on the Billboard 200, the two artists are much closer to one another. The stars are currently tied with one another for the third-most No. 1 titles, with 12 apiece. Drake will pull ahead in a few weeks with For All The Dogs, but his win might be short-lived. Swift has a new project coming in October as well, and since both are all but assured the top spot for at least one frame, Drake won\u2019t gain much ground over Swift, but another No. 1 is nothing to complain about./n"

In fact, she occupies more than half of the spaces inside the top 10 this week, almost entirely with debuts from the re-recorded set, which is very similar to her 2014 blockbuster 1989. \"Is It Over Now?\" was one of the \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d tracks from the album, which means it was originally written and conceived during the 1989 sessions nearly a decade ago but not released./n"

But her greatest nonmusical achievement is the innocuous art she\u2019s made of the gape. On a 50-foot screen, the various apertures of her mouth constitute a spectacle. There\u2019s the \u201cWho? Me?,\u201d the \u201cyeah I said it,\u201d the \u201couch,\u201d the \u201cooooo,\u201d the \u201cgosh golly\u201d and the \u201cSally Field wins another Oscar.\u201d Hers is the story of \u201coh.\u201d/nThat glee is a reason to be happy about the movie that\u2019s been assembled from her live show \u2014 \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d which was shot at SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles, the final stop on the tour\u2019s first leg. \u201cHappy\u201d because it\u2019s recorded what a gladdening agent Swift can be on a stage and the stamina summoned to power that agency for the better part of three hours. The movie\u2019s about 165 minutes long, and she\u2019s as ebullient descending into the stage, for her farewell, as she is in the opening minutes magically materializing upon it. The first words she speaks to the 70,000 people hooting for her are, \u201cOh, hi!,\u201d as if SoFi were a shower we\u2019d caught her singing in./nIn June, when Swift landed at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the pushing and screaming \u2014 by five high schoolers \u2014 to my immediate rear ceased at about the two-hour mark. I turned to check on the state of their ecstasy and found a pile of fatigue \u2014 the human version of that crumpled face emoji. Her glee had outlasted theirs, her zing had them zung. If nothing else, this movie\u2019s a monument to that: Swift\u2019s illusion of ease. She doesn\u2019t work as physically hard or as loosely or hydraulically as her dancers. She\u2019s not a Jackson. And she doesn\u2019t sing as enormously or as exquisitely as a Streisand, Carey, Dion or Knowles-Carter. Nor is her show \u2014 produced as discrete segments devoted to nine of Swift\u2019s 10 albums \u2014 the cultural gymnasium Madonna requires. Swift plays to her enhanced strengths: candied pitch, arresting stature, toothsome songwriting, winking, the very idea of play. Not far into things, right around \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d she announces that we\u2019ve encountered \u201cthe very first bridge of the evening.\u201d There are more to come, because not since Lionel Richie has a major pop star so enjoyed the pleasure in the might of her bridgecraft./nIt wasn\u2019t until this movie that Swift\u2019s 10-minute breakup ballad \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d which she performs alone downstage in a glittering robe and an acoustic guitar, struck me as an achievement of genuine theater. Rapt in a movie theater, I felt the song\u2019s heart-wrung pique in a new way. Some of that comes from watching Swift\u2019s face register the ache, tsking recrimination. The rest comes from the song pooling outward into anthem territory. Live, it\u2019s like watching someone woodwork \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d until it resembles \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d/n\u201cEras\u201d is studded with little revelations like that. Another: the \u201cReputation\u201d section of the show contains her freest, most ambitious singing and movement. That album is the first in which she approximates the mischievous, cunning, swaggy music that Beyonc\u00e9 or Rihanna could make. But the kick of its first six songs is that Swift invites the dare. She spends this part of the show dressed in a serpentine unitard. She knows./nOne more aha: Swift can command a stage. I\u2019d never thought of her as someone a camera has to take in. But anytime she\u2019s in one of those glittering bathing suits and a pair of spangled knee-high boots, the length of her demands in-taking. She can strike a formidable pose. But early, when she points to different spots in SoFi and those sections start to roar, she jokes that that kind of power is \u201cdangerous\u201d before kissing her biceps, except I don\u2019t think she\u2019s joking. She understands her power and she\u2019s skilled at performing the accident of having so much of it, like she can\u2019t also believe how the country would react if she, say, started going to football games and chest-bumping folks and being associated with a thing of nearby chicken fingers. Her embodiment of lightness and blitheness and insouciance constitutes a talent. Another gape: Did I do that?/nThe show confirmed my sense that Swift can\u2019t be serious \u2014 doesn\u2019t want to be \u2014 for long, lest she be labeled self-serious. She\u2019s fine with attention but less so with her own monumentality. That discomfort strikes me as the source of the Taylor-as-Godzilla imagery of \u201cAnti-Hero,\u201d a dirge in jam\u2019s clothing. In concert, Swift is as committed to skipping like a cartoon first grader along the stage as she is to sashaying and skulking around it. She\u2019d rather be running than standing still, accruing meaning. She\u2019d rather use her body for screwball comedy than for totemism. She knows what a holy object we\u2019ve made and seems to be trying to undercut that. These are thoughts that could occur to you live in the moment of the show itself. But now the camera permits you to savor it./nSo it\u2019s a shame that the shots here are all over the place \u2014 the stage, the sky, too close, too far, too kinetic; only occasionally, in medium close-ups, just right. The director is Sam Wrench, and it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019s making a movie or a salad. Under the circumstances, he\u2019s done the best he probably could. For one thing, his camera operators and editors have to compete with the jumbo monitors that project what\u2019s at the center of the stadium to its farthest reaches. Few movie screens can hold a candle to one of those \u2014 the screen at my theater wasn\u2019t one of them, anyway. The projected image delivers a Swift who seems to be in higher resolution than the woman onstage. The breakthroughs in screen imaging have changed the concert-going experience for better and worse. They\u2019ve democratized it, and that\u2019s great./nYou can actually experience Swift more clearly in the upper decks than in the inner circles. The concert screens literalize her cultural magnitude. But they seem like hell on good filmmaking. Unless, no one prioritized attempting to shoot around them so that Swift isn\u2019t being upstaged by herself. Of course, that inner-circle seat is, if not priceless (there was definitely a price tag), then certainly far more valuable since, whenever Swift makes her way to the stage\u2019s lip, we can shove a phone in her face. That introduces a modern eyesore for a concert film: other people\u2019s movies. The \u201cEras\u201d crew has clearly aimed to keep the amateur films mostly out of the shots. But they\u2019re there, nonetheless, as intrusive in a movie as they are at the show itself./nWhat is it we should expect from a concert movie? Cinema or fax? \u201cEras\u201d is proof that an event took place and that the event was fun. There\u2019s more it could have been, of course. \u201cMore\u201d just opened a few weeks ago \u2014 well, reopened in the form of \u201cStop Making Sense,\u201d the 1984 concert movie Jonathan Demme made from a few Talking Heads shows, also in Los Angeles. The film predates the camera phone but not the audience. You barely hear one, and he rarely cuts away to it. The film captures one man expanding into a family and the family into a kind of small choir. Maybe Swift is too big for that movie\u2019s living-room approach. But surely there\u2019s a more imaginative strategy to bring her to us than point-and-shoot./nI know. \u201cEras\u201d wasn\u2019t made to be art. It was made to be an index of art that got made. It was made for posterity. Oh \u2014 and for the hundreds of people in the parking lot at every Eras show who could sort of hear Swift and had to make do with seeing only each other. The movie is for them. And they\u2019re gonna gape their faces off./nWhen you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission./nMovie data powered by IMDb.com/nWesley Morris is a critic at large and the co-host, with Jenna Wortham, of the culture podcast \u201cStill Processing.\u201d He has won two Pulitzer Prizes for criticism, including in 2021 for a set of essays that explored the intersection of race and pop culture.

(Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)/nGoogle\nGOOG\n is the most-visited website on the internet, and it receives several billion hits per day globally. It may seem like the company would be ready for anything that could come its way...but Taylor Swift proved to be too popular for the search engine./nSwift's devoted fanbase, known as Swifties, inundated Google by taking part in a new game the tech giant set up with the singer to promote her forthcoming album 1989 (Taylor's Version). It turns out that there are simply too many of them and that they\u2019re more ravenous for anything attached to the star, as their intense activity actually crashed part of Google./nTo engage fans and amp up excitement for 1989 (Taylor's Version), Swift and Google introduced a series of 1989-themed word puzzles via the website. Fans could join in the fun by beginning a traditional Google search for \"Taylor Swift\" and then clicking on the blue vault icon that appeared./nThe goal behind this venture was for fans to \u201cunlock the vault\u201d and reveal the names of the as-yet-unreleased songs set to be featured on 1989 (Taylor's Version). The album is a reworking of her original 1989, but with a handful of tracks written and recorded during that time period included, with fans hearing them for the first time./nSwifties across the globe got to work quickly, with millions of fans playing millions of games. Google stated that once 33 million puzzles had been solved, the \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d song titles would be unveiled. This proved to be too exciting for many, and it didn\u2019t take long before the entire program stopped working for some trying to get in on the fun./nGoogle even confirmed the technical hiccup on Twitter, stating, \"Swifties, the vault is jammed! But don't worry, there are no blank spaces inside. We're in our fix-it era and will be out of the woods soon.\"/nIt seems the glitch was fixed quickly, as Swifties completed enough word puzzles to learn the names of four of the five \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d songs set to be featured on 1989 (Taylor's Version). The tunes are titled \"Is It Over Now?,\" \"Now That We Don't Talk,\" \"Say Don't Go,\" and \"Suburban Legends.\" There is still one track left to be revealed, which was hinted at via an animated video the singer posted on her Instagram. Many fans predict that based on the letters included in that visual, the song might be named \u201cLust!\u201d/n1989 (Taylor's Version) will drop on October 27, but Swift hasn\u2019t shared yet whether she\u2019ll be releasing any more of the songs featured on the full-length ahead of its street date./n"

    "content": "Taylor Swift\u00a0and Katy Perry's feud was one for the celebrity ages; it led to the iconic Taylor song 'Bad Blood,' and left two passionate fandoms at each other's (metaphorical) throats for years. But what really happened \u2013 and are the pair friends now?\u00a0/nThe fellow music superstars had long been thought to be friends \u2013 Katy performed her single 'Hot N Cold' during a surprise appearance during the 2010 Fearless tour, and they often tweeted at each other.\u00a0/nBut by 2014 it appeared things had changed. \u00a0Taylor, now 33, released her Grammy-winning album 1989 and the song 'Bad Blood' was revealed to be about another female artist in the industry, and not an ex-boyfriend.\u00a0/n\"For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,\" Taylor told\u00a0Rolling Stone. \"She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'\"\u00a0/nTaylor then revealed that the unnamed adversary's actions left them as \"straight-up enemies,\" claiming that her enemy had \"tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational\u2014you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So, now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it.\"/nAlthough neither party named the other, the next day Katy, now 38, tweeted: \"Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing...\", and later added: \"If somebody is trying to defame my character, you're going to hear about it.\"/nKaty confirmed their feud in 2017 during an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden. \"Honestly, it's really like she started it and it's time for her to finish it,\" Katy said, before sharing her own side of the story.\u00a0/n\"Okay, so there was like three backing dancers that went on tour with her tour (sic), right? And they asked me before they went on tour if they could go, and I was like, 'Yeah, of course. I'm not on a record cycle and get the work, and she's great and all that.\u00a0/n\"But I will be on a record cycle probably in about a year. So, be sure to put a 30-day contingency in your contract, so you can get out if you want to join me when I say I'm going back on.' So that year came up, right? And I texted all of them because I'm very close with them and I said, 'Look, just FYI, I'm about to start. I want to put the word out there.' They said, 'Okay, well we're gonna go and talk to management about it.' And they did, and they got fired.\"\u00a0/nKaty then said it would be \"100 percent\" enough if Taylor texted her an apology.\u00a0/n'Swish Swish' was released in 2017 and famously was rumored to be about their feud.\u00a0/n\"A tiger don't lose no sleep / Don't need opinions / From a shellfish or a sheep,\" verse one began with a nod to her song 'Roar' and the tweet from 2014 in which she called Taylor a \"Regina George in sheep's clothing\"./n\"And karma's not a liar / She keeps receipts,\" Katy sang on the second verse, a scathing reference to Kim Kardashian's attempted 2016 takedown of Taylor over\u00a0Kanye West's song 'Famous' and the lyrics to which Taylor objected./nIn 2018 Taylor kicked off the reputation tour \u2013 and revealed that Katy had, literally, extended an olive branch of friendship. \"I just got back to my dressing room and found this actual olive branch. This...means so much to me,\" Taylor said in a video posted to her Instagram Stories.\u00a0/nThe handwritten note attached began: \"Hey old friend,\" and was in an envelope sealed with a sticker featuring the American Idol judge's dog.\u00a0/nIn 2020 Katy revealed that Taylor had hand embroidered a blanket for her newborn baby daughter, Daisy./n\"Miss [Daisy Dove] adores her hand embroidered blankie from miss @taylorswift. Hope it\u2019s one she drags around for years till it becomes an unrecognizable shred that she keeps in her pocket as a teenager,\" the doting mom captioned an Instagram post./nIn June 2019 Taylor debuted the music video for her single 'You Need To Calm Down,' which was to be part of her then-upcoming seventh album, Lover./nAs well as appearances from famous friends including Ryan Reynolds, Todrick Hall, Antoni Porowski and Bobby Berk, fans were shocked to see Katy, dressed as a hamburger, in the video. The moment sees Taylor \u2013 dressed as French fries \u2013 hugging the singer, with their feud fully behind them.\u00a0/nThe 'Shake It Off' singer then revealed that the two had been \"on very good terms\" for longer than people realized.\u00a0/n\"We were just kind of reconnecting privately and just wanted to make sure that everything was really good with us and that it was like a very real thing before we let anyone know that we're not only good but we're friends again. So it was really wonderful to get to, sort of,\u00a0unveil it to the world in a cheeky sort of funny way,\" she told Heart Breakfast, a British radio station.\u00a0/n\"Everything was on good terms and we ran into each other at a party a while ago and it was literally like in the video, seeing each other but without the food costume,\" she added. \"It was like just fully sincere and full, like we've realized like we've grown up, we've grown enough to realize the fact that us feeling pitted against each other for so long really did add to whatever tension we were feeling in our friendship, and [reconnecting] is just a really positive thing for both of us in our lives.\"/nGet the lowdown on the biggest, hottest celebrity news, features and profiles coming out of the U.S. \u00a0Sign up to our HELLO!

[+] supposed clues. (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)/nApple acquired the rights to Argylle, starring the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard and Dua Lipa, in a reported $200 million deal in 2021, a huge sum that raised some eyebrows because the source material is the debut novel from unknown author Elly Conway\u2014and the book is not even out yet./nSwifties have scoured Conway\u2019s Instagram account, which does not contain any pictures of the author herself; fans pointed out her first post was made on December 13, Swift\u2019s birthday, and her post of the official Argylle poster features a Scottish Fold cat, the same breed as Swift\u2019s two cats./nChip, the cat from Argylle, has his own Instagram account, too\u2014Swift is one of the 21 accounts he follows\u2014and earlier this week, he posted a picture of his owner with lyrics from Swift\u2019s \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d in the caption./nSome fans have gone viral on social media this week compiling scores of \u201cevidence\u201d that Swift must be involved in the film, noting Swift wore a sweater during \u201cEras Tour\u201d rehearsals that says \u201cConway Studios,\u201d and a character on Australian soap opera Neighbours shares Conway\u2019s name and made her first appearance on the show on Swift\u2019s birthday./nHoward stars as a fictionalized version of Conway in Argylle, and some Swifties have pointed out her portrayal of a red-haired author bears a striking resemblance to Swift, who similarly portrays a redheaded author in her \u201cAll Too Well\u201d music video./nSwift has also ventured into writing and directing in recent years: She\u2019s reportedly writing and directing a film for Searchlight Pictures, and she\u2019s directed most of her recent music videos./nForbes reached out to Apple Studios for comment./nSwifties have flooded the comments of Conway\u2019s Instagram account accusing her of being Swift.

In 2017, she said the \u201cwhole video\u201d for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d is an Easter egg, and she hid the titles of future singles in the video for 2019\u2019s \u201cME!\u201d For her re-recorded albums, which contain previously unreleased songs, Swift challenges fans to unscramble song titles.

As the tune continues its ascent, Swift finds herself in the company of some legendary artists, matching one in particular for the first time./nThis week, \u201cCruel Summer\u201d soars to new heights, landing in the No. 4 spot on the Hot 100. Just last week, the song had been at No. 6, so it enters the top five on the ranking of the most-consumed tunes in the U.S. for the first time./nNow that \u201cCruel Summer\u201d has become Swift\u2019s latest top five smash on the Hot 100, the singer ties with Mariah Carey for the second-most placements in the region among women. The two powerhouses have both sent 27 tracks into the arena, according to Billboard./nThe only woman who has scored more top fives on the Hot 100 is Madonna, and she\u2019s not ahead by much. Swift and Carey are just one win behind the Queen of Pop at the moment./nSwift and Carey's impressive record places them side-by-side in fourth place among all artists with the most top five hits on the Hot 100. Drake stands ahead of everyone else with a remarkable 36 appearances in the top five. In an interesting twist, Swift's rise is mirrored by Drake's continued success, as he and Travis Scott's latest single, \"Meltdown,\" makes its debut at No. 3 on this week's chart, so he ups his count as well./nThe Beatles hold the second spot among artists with the most top five hits on the Hot 100. They managed to send 29 songs into the upper echelons of the chart, with most of them reaching the coveted No. 1 position./nLooking ahead, Swift's trajectory appears clear, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before this ranking changes again. As she inches closer to Madonna's record, the possibility of Swift tying, and then passing, the superstar seem likely. She will also almost surely match and then beat The Beatles as well./nThat said, whether or not she can catch up to Drake is unclear. While names like Carey, Madonna and The Beatles haven\u2019t added another top five hit in quite some time, Drake regularly sends songs toward the top of the tally, and he and Swift are now in a race against one another./n"

It will also likely be the first to gross $1 billion in ticket sales./nWith a net worth of $740 million, according to Forbes, Swift has the cash to be this generous, especially with tons flowing into her bank account thanks to her tour. In 2013, the magazine estimated that she earned $55 million, making her one of the highest-earning women and musicians in the world that year./n"

The song was never released as a single during the initial Lover promotional cycle\u2014instead, ME! (feat. Brendan Urie) was released as its lead single, receiving some negative reviews (it didn\u2019t make the cut for the \u201cEras Tour\u201d setlist). The other songs then promoted as singles were \u201cLover,\u201d \u201cYou Need To Calm Down\u201d and \u201cThe Man.\u201d \u201cCruel Summer\u201d was met with praise from critics and fans upon its release: In 2019, the Los Angeles Times named it the best song on Lover.

That album came out four years ago. And I just need to let you know something. \u2018Cruel Summer,\u2019 that song was my pride and joy on that album. You have conversations before the album comes out. Everybody around weighs in on what they think should be singles. I was finally, finally about to have my favorite song become the single off of Lover, and I\u2019m not trying to blame the global pandemic that we had, but that is something that happened that stopped Cruel Summer from ever being a single.\u201d/n1,239,311,929. That\u2019s how many Spotify streams \u201cCruel Summer\u201d currently has, making it the most streamed song on Lover\u2014surpassing all the songs promoted as singles four years ago. It\u2019s Swift\u2019s third most streamed song on Spotify, ranking ahead of some of her signature hits, like \u201cShake It Off\u201d and \u201cStyle.\u201d/n\u201cCruel Summer\u201d isn\u2019t Swift\u2019s only years-old song to surge in popularity.

(Photo by Erika Goldring/WireImage)/nAfter years of being a rising talent in the music industry, Zach Bryan is officially a star. The singer-songwriter is back with a new album, and the masses have rushed to snap it up in huge numbers. The country and rock musician rules the two most important Billboard charts this frame, and in doing so in the exact manner he\u2019s managed, Bryan has made history and matched a feat reserved for only the biggest names in the business./nBryan claims the No. 1 position on both the Billboard 200 and the Hot 100 charts. The former ranking focuses on the most-consumed albums, and Bryan\u2019s self-titled new collection opens in first place with 200,000 equivalent units shifted. The Hot 100 is a list of the most-consumed songs in the U.S., and his single \u201cI Remember Everything\u201d with Kacey Musgraves launches ahead of every other title./nIt\u2019s not odd for a popular musician to claim the No. 1 spot on either the Hot 100 or Billboard 200, or even both at the same time, but Bryan\u2019s titles debut in the same space\u2026at the same time. This is relatively uncommon, and only a handful of artists have managed this specific showing. In fact, Billboard reports that this has only happened nine times in history, and Bryan is just the fifth act to do so./nAs he debuts at No. 1 on both the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 simultaneously, Bryan joins the likes of Taylor Swift, BTS, Drake, and Future in this showing. Swift was the first to do so, and she made history back in 2020 when her album Folklore and its lead single \u201cCardigan\u201d launched in first place on their respective charts. Amazingly, the pop and country superstar has gone on to replicate this showing three more times, accounting for about half of all instances of this feat taking place./nDrake is the only other artist aside from Swift to debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 at the same time more than once. He did so in 2021 with his album Certified Lover Boy and its single \u201cWay 2 Sexy\u201d with Future and Young Thug. He then managed to do so again the following year with Honestly, Nevermind and its biggest hit, \u201cJimmy Cooks\u201d with 21 Savage./nBTS was the second act to follow Swift, and they scored a No. 1 on both charts in 2020 with their short album Be and its single \u201cLife Goes On.\u201d Future is also a member of this club, as his album I Never Liked You launched at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2022, as did the song \u201cWait For U\u201d with Tems and Drake./n"

Watch a few of these clips, and it might strike you that the dance moves, in contrast to the designer costumes and visual effects, are rather simple and unoriginal, the sort of thing anyone might be able to pull off./nAt least that\u2019s what I thought before seeing the Eras Tour live. Experiencing it in Los Angeles, at the end of its first United States leg, I changed my mind. As dance, the show is simple and unoriginal \u2014 yet exceptionally effective./nSwift is a pop superstar who dances but is not known for her dancing. Even many of her admirers will admit that in this respect she\u2019s no Beyonc\u00e9, no Britney Spears \u2014 that as hard as she tries, she\u2019s a little stiff and awkward. Be that as it may, body language is crucial to how the three-hour-plus performance works./nOn Friday, at the second of six Los Angeles concerts, the most significant gesture came early, between songs. Basking in the deafening roar of 70,000 fans, Swift struck a coy \u201cWho, me?\u201d pose and said she wanted to try something. She pointed at a section of SoFi Stadium, and the cheering from that section somehow got louder./n\u201cI feel so powerful,\u201d she said, kissing a bicep. But the power she was flexing wasn\u2019t muscular. It was her ability \u2014 with the magnification of giant video screens \u2014 to connect with every member of the crowd. The choreography helped keep that connection a live wire./nI don\u2019t just mean the dance numbers, though there are plenty of those, choreographed by Mandy Moore (\u201cLa La Land,\u201d \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance?\u201d). The backup dancers sometimes contributed to the spectacle. They handled the billowing floral parachutes that concealed and revealed Swift at the start. They wielded glowing orbs during \u201cWillow,\u201d clouds on ladders during \u201cLavender Haze,\u201d umbrellas during \u201cMidnight Rain.\u201d Not especially imaginative, this was all just something big enough to see./nElsewhere, the dancers helped suggest the situations of the songs. The bicep kiss was a segue to \u201cThe Man,\u201d a complaint about gender double standards that was staged as an ascent up the stairs and levels of an office set populated by chest-thumping workers. In other songs, a few dancers played roles: the boyfriend that Swift berates for emotional neglect across (and atop) a long dinner table in \u201cTolerate It,\u201d or the scandalizing socialite protagonist of \u201cThe Last Great American Dynasty.\u201d/nBut really, the concert has only one character, Swift. In \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d the dancers were costumed as earlier versions of her, trapped in transparent boxes like dolls. Mostly, though, they served as a friend group or party guests. A happy, diverse bunch, they did a little ballroom dancing to evoke the romantic fantasy of \u201cLover,\u201d a little vogueing to give \u201cBejeweled\u201d some shimmer./nAnd then they left. Which is to say, they left the audience alone with Swift, again and again, re-establishing the thrill of mass intimacy. Other pop stars use this effect, but it\u2019s especially potent with Swift because she\u2019s also a singer-songwriter, who can sit at a piano or tap into the iconography of a guitar-slinging truth teller./nThe most intense moments of the show were in this mode: the 10-minute extended version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d and the acoustic mini-set of \u201csecret songs\u201d that differ from night to night. This is almost pointedly not dancing, but it requires a particular physicality at which Swift excels. She has the wide stance, both confident and confiding. She looks grounded, comfortable, at home./nThat\u2019s generally true when she isn\u2019t dancing. She can strut or skip around the huge catwalk and stage that extend across the stadium floor without looking small. She can strike over-the-shoulder poses for the camera. She can inhabit her many sparkly costumes \u2014 rolling her hips in fringe dresses and Louboutin boots, using the flowy sleeves on her \u201cFolklore\u201d dress the way Stevie Nicks uses scarves./nSo does it matter that in the cafe chair burlesque routine for \u201cVigilante ___,\u201d a homage to louche Bob Fosse dances, she\u2019s imprecise and physically uncommitted to the pleasures and dangers of sex? (She caresses her body like she\u2019s afraid to.) It doesn\u2019t, because her fans love her anyway. And it does, because this imperfect dancing is, I think, part of her nonthreatening Everywoman image. It makes her easier to identify with./nAnd that is what the whole concert is about, the identification between Swift and the fans she continually thanks and flatters, the fans who know every word to every song. Swift told the L.A. crowd that when those fans sing her lyrics along with her, she takes that as a sign that they too have felt what she felt./nIt makes sense, then, that she moves the way anyone might move. So that anyone might imagine being her \u2014 just pointing and feeling powerful./nAdvertisement"

They had heard rumors that Taylor Swift might be coming to Buenos Aires, and they wanted to be first in line./nThe rumors were right: Ms. Swift was coming, but it would take a while. Her concert was more than five months away./nThe tent stayed anyway, occupied by a rotating cast of 30 die-hard Swifties who worked together over 163 days to hold their spots in line for a chance to get as close as possible to their idol when she walked onstage Thursday in the first stop of her Eras Tour outside North America./n\u201cWe have been waiting for this for many years,\u201d said Ms. Romeo, 23, who quit her job as a cashier partly to dedicate herself to waiting in line. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect her to come, and then she did. So it was obvious that we had to do what we had to do.\u201d/nMs. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour officially went global on Thursday when the pop megastar began a new phase of shows that would take her to 25 cities across South America, Asia, Australia and Europe over the next 10 months./nSince March, the North American stretch of the tour has become an economic marvel and a cultural force, cementing Ms. Swift\u2019s status as one of the most influential, and beloved, people on the continent. Now, she is set to demonstrate that her fame and adoration go well beyond borders./nThere are few countries better to display the intense passion of her fans than Argentina. While Ms. Swift has become a certified global icon, Argentina has become known for worshiping icons with religious fervor./nConsider that Juan and Eva Per\u00f3n became Argentina\u2019s president and first lady in 1946 but are still lionized in political chants, are displayed in portraits in many Argentine homes and are the inspiration for a namesake political movement that still runs the country. Diego Maradona, the soccer star, became seen as such a deity here that tens of thousands of Argentines belong to the, yes, Church of Maradona, a legally recognized religion in its 25th year. And after Lionel Messi and the national soccer team won the World Cup last year, the crush of four million adoring fans during the victory parade forced the players to abandon their buses and fly over in a helicopter instead./n\u201cShe\u2019s like the female Messi,\u201d said Ms. Romeo, offering Ms. Swift about the highest praise an Argentine could nowadays. Some fans in Buenos Aires this week wore jerseys of the national soccer team with \u201cSWIFT\u201d on the back, while others passed out a sort of prayer card with Ms. Swift\u2019s head superimposed over Jesus Christ\u2019s./nSo it was no surprise that Ms. Swift\u2019s arrival in Argentina became a national event. It received intense news coverage; Buenos Aires named her an official guest of honor; and she became a figure in next week\u2019s presidential election after some of her fans organized against the far-right candidate, Javier Milei. Meteorologists even described forecasts for sun or rain this weekend as \u201cdry Swifties\u201d or \u201cwet Swifties.\u201d (Friday called for \u201cwet Swifties,\u201d so organizers rescheduled that show for Sunday.)/n\u201cEveryone in the country knows her, and everyone knows about this show,\u201d Renata Schyfys, 15, said at the show on Thursday, wearing at least six inches of friendship bracelets, which have become a badge of Swiftie fandom./nIn a country of 46 million people, Ms. Swift sold roughly 200,000 tickets across three sold-out shows, and yet the waiting list still had more than 2.8 million people \u2014 enough to fill Argentina\u2019s biggest soccer arena, El Monumental, another 40 times./nThat stadium was shaking on Thursday night with near-constant, ear-piercing screams coming from the more than 70,000 fans there who repeatedly chanted, \u201cOl\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, Taylor, Taylor.\u201d/nEven Ms. Swift, who has seen her share of huge crowds, seemed taken aback. \u201cI am looking out to possibly what might be one of the most epic crowds to ever exist,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cThis is on another level.\u201d/nLater, she removed her earpieces and motioned that she was struggling to hear over the roar of the crowd. She paused for a full two minutes, soaking in her fans\u2019 adoration./n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you enough for the way you\u2019re treating me tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cI love you so, so much, and I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken me so long to come see you.\u201d/nThe show on Thursday was Ms. Swift\u2019s first major concert in South America, the first of nine this month in Argentina and Brazil. After waiting for so long, many Swifties on Thursday said they had made a sort of pilgrimage, many from across the continent./nNahuel Ochoa, a medical student wearing a homemade bedazzled jumpsuit and a glittery jacket, had taken a bus with 50 other fans from the city of San Luis, 12 hours away. Unable to get a room in Buenos Aires, where hotels were nearly sold out, he was planning to take the bus back after the show \u2014 and then return on Saturday to see Ms. Swift again./n\u201cWe have loved Taylor since we were 10 years old \u2014 we have been waiting 13 years,\u201d Mr. Ochoa, 23, said, sitting alongside his childhood friend Andrea Garro. \u201cHer songs reflect the majority of what we go through. It\u2019s a form of expressing ourselves in a way that we can\u2019t.\u201d/nMs. Garro, 23, a law student, added that Ms. Swift\u2019s music helped her get past a deep depression. \u201cWe feel seen,\u201d she said./nBut there was no show of devotion greater than the more than 100 fans who camped out in shifts outside the stadium for months. After Ms. Romeo and her friends staked out their spot and attracted local news attention, other tents followed./nThe group of mostly young women set up shifts using a spreadsheet, with ideally at least two people present at the tent at all times. The 30 members of Ms. Romeo\u2019s tent had to spend a minimum of 40 hours there a month, with each member spending about 10 to 12 nights at the tent on average. After spending the first few days sleeping with just blankets, they added a mattress./n\u201cShe has the best relationship with her fans and is the one that can achieve this sort of mania,\u201d said Lucas Forte, 24, a member of another tent who had slept outside the stadium for five nights since September. \u201cNo one camped out for the Weeknd, for example.\u201d/nMs. Swift herself was impressed with the effort. \u201cI heard you guys were camping out to get good spots?\u201d she asked the crowd on Thursday. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t believe it until I saw a video.\u201d/nThe fans camping out were not holding a place to get tickets to the show. Those were all sold online. Rather, the tents were set up so they could be first in line when the doors to the show opened and the fans could sprint to the guardrails along the stage for a closer view./nEvent organizers helped make sure the fans who had camped out were first in line \u2014 yet many still ended up behind rows of people whose pricier tickets had allowed them to enter even earlier./nBut some campers eventually reached the barricade along the stage./n\u201cI smashed my knee trying to get there,\u201d said Atenas Astuni, 23, a member of the first-in-line tent, her voice hoarse the Friday morning after the show. \u201cBut if I had to smash my knee again to repeat exactly what happened yesterday, I would do it without hesitation.\u201d/nJack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief, covering Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. He previously reported on technology from San Francisco and, before joining The Times in 2018, spent seven years at The Wall Street Journal. More about Jack Nicas/nAdvertisement"

The Jets were flailing after their 39-year-old would-be savior tore his Achilles\u2019 tendon minutes into the season./nBut many millions of people tuned in anyway: America\u2019s most breathlessly covered situationship \u2014 between Kansas City\u2019s All-Pro tight end, Travis Kelce, and pop music\u2019s biggest star, Taylor Swift \u2014 was playing out on prime-time television./n\u201cThey are two of the biggest media entertainment entities,\u201d said Nora Princiotti, a football writer for The Ringer who also co-hosts a popular music podcast that often focuses on Swift./nThe game was surprisingly competitive, with the Chiefs narrowly beating the Jets, 23-20. And the telecast also offered a spectacular collision of the nation\u2019s most-watched prime-time show and the ardent fans of a pop star at the height of her powers./nMaria Taylor, the host of NBC\u2019s pregame show on Sunday night, opened her monologue with an unsubtle nod to a Swift song, \u201cEnchanted.\u201d Over the next hour, anchors called attention to a Swift look-alike, and cameras showed fans wearing Swift T-shirts./nThe network also featured a collage of photos of Swift at last week\u2019s Chiefs-Bears game, and around 7:42 p.m., cameras showed Swift herself at MetLife Stadium./nAbout 10 minutes later, NBC aired a mash-up of TikTok videos, photos and scenes from Kelce\u2019s podcast, unspooling football story lines as well as the week\u2019s celebrity buzz. Then the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d broadcast officially began with mentions of Jets and Chiefs players preparing to take the field./n\u201cOh, and yeah, she\u2019s here: Taylor is in the house,\u201d the play-by-play announcer Mike Tirico said while NBC showed Swift hugging someone in a luxury suite. Tirico then added, \u201cHi Swifties, we\u2019ll be with you all night.\u201d/nGiven Swift\u2019s mega-fame and penchant for writing songs about her romantic relationships, her dating life has long been a subject of scrutiny. But the frenzied curiosity of the past week was rare even for Swift./nFox Sports said the Chiefs-Bears game that Swift attended was the week\u2019s most-watched telecast on any network, with 24.3 million viewers powered in part by a strong female audience. Fox cameras frequently panned to her reactions after Kelce, the game\u2019s leading receiver, touched the ball./nOn Sunday, NBC showed Swift several times but focused primarily on the football game. Network officials had said it was important to satisfy its regular audience, even though they knew that some viewers would be mostly interested in the 12-time Grammy winner./n\u201cWe\u2019re aware we could be reaching new eyeballs,\u201d Rob Hyland, the coordinating producer of \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d said on Friday./nJust before Sunday night\u2019s game began, NBC ran yet another teaser for the contest \u2014 this one narrated by the television host Carson Daly \u2014 explaining the stakes of the football matchup with at least a half-dozen call-outs to titles of Swift songs./nWhen the Chiefs quickly scored a touchdown in the first quarter, the cameras turned to Swift\u2019s celebration, even though Kelce was not involved with the play. During the commercial break that followed, NBC aired, for a second time, a high-gloss commercial for Swift\u2019s Eras Tour concert movie that hits theaters this month./nLater in the evening, NBC showed a \u201cCornelia St.\u201d sign in Manhattan (Swift wrote a song about the street); Donna Kelce, the tight end\u2019s mother, got more screen time with Swift; and Melissa Stark gave a sideline report about the spike in Kelce jersey sales./nThe Chiefs and a publicist for Swift did not respond to a request for comment./nBut with Swift\u2019s Eras Tour briefly on pause, her concert movie forthcoming and Kelce\u2019s commitment to his football podcast as his Hall of Fame-caliber career wanes, a supercharged dose of crossover publicity on national television was probably a welcome boost, even for the already famous./nKelce led the Chiefs with six receptions but had a quiet night by his standards.

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nFor that live show experience, these films capture exhilarating music by Beyonc\u00e9, Shakira, A Tribe Called Quest, Talking Heads and more./nBy The New York Times/nIf you saw \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d in a theater and enjoyed the vicarious thrill of watching a concert onscreen, here are eight more films of live shows \u2014 picked by the Culture desk writers \u2014 that will give you a taste of the same experience./nAvailable to stream on Netflix/nBeyonc\u00e9 just announced a new concert film, due in December. Until then there\u2019s her 2018 performance at Coachella. It was the stuff of legends. Marching bands! A Destiny\u2019s Child reunion! So when \u201cHomecoming\u201d dropped on Netflix the next year, it truly felt like a gift. The film is one of intriguing contradictions, feeling both intimate and outsize at once. You see the painstaking hard work in every stunning piece of choreography and hear it in every breathtaking vocal, yet Queen Bey makes it look effortless. Mekado Murphy/nIn theaters/nWhat elevates \u201cStop Making Sense\u201d \u2014 and what has made its recent 40th anniversary rerelease now in theaters such a sensation \u2014 is its formal elegance. David Byrne begins alone onstage with a tape player and, as fellow musicians gradually accrue with each song, ends as the large-suited ringleader of a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll circus. The director Jonathan Demme knows he doesn\u2019t need spectacle or special effects to transfix: He just allows each frame to fill with the charisma of a great band. Lindsay Zoladz/nAvailable to stream on Disney+ and Hulu/nIf 1970\u2019s \u201cWoodstock\u201d is one of the defining concert documentaries, \u201cSummer of Soul,\u201d released in 2021, acts as a sort of complement and rejoinder to it. Questlove\u2019s Oscar-winning film exuberantly unearths footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival \u2014 which took place the same summer as Woodstock \u2014 and cuts together some of the most extraordinary performances from artists like Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Gladys Knight, Nina Simone and so many more. Questlove includes interviews with participants and attendees that contextualize the sets musically and historically, but the film\u2019s power is the ability to make you feel as if you are in the crowd even if you are just sitting on your couch. Esther Zuckerman/nAvailable to stream on Max/nThis 1970 documentary directed by the Maysles brothers and Charlotte Zwerin is known as something of a Zapruder film for the death of the \u201960s, with its footage of a killing at the Rolling Stones\u2019 free concert at Altamont Speedway a year earlier. Still, the movie\u2019s great music gets across the promise that was lost: Mick Jagger in an Uncle Sam top hat and a long lavender scarf, hip-thrusting his way through \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash.\u201d The Flying Burrito Brothers raving up \u201cSix Days on the Road\u201d when it still seemed like Altamont could be \u201cthe greatest party of 1969.\u201d And most explosively, Tina Turner, singing \u201cI\u2019ve Been Loving You Too Long\u201d and giving a microphone the time of its life. David Renard/nAvailable to stream or rent on major platforms/nThe Music for the Masses tour brought the British synth band\u2019s yearning songs \u2014 reverberating like confessional hymns in a cathedral \u2014 to the Rose Bowl and beyond in 1987-88. \u201cDepeche Mode: 101\u201d takes in the smokily lighted shows (with lead singer Dave Gahan in a billowing white shirt) and the bright-eyed \u201cbus kids,\u201d fans who went along for the ride. D.A. Pennebaker tunes into the heartbeat of Depeche Mode\u2019s electronic sound, co-directing with Chris Hegedus and David Dawkins. Nicolas Rapold/nAvailable to rent or buy on most major platforms./nI would wager this is the only concert film, directed by Joe DeMaio, that periodically cuts away from the performance to show documentary segments about the Zapatistas, the rebel political group of southern Mexico. Tonally, it\u2019s a turn-of-the-century time capsule: The frenetic live footage (recorded in 1999 and released in 2001) seems to have been edited by a can of Red Bull. But the band\u2019s knockout blend of overt leftist ideology and inventive, funky rap-over-metal holds up. Look for the guitarist Tom Morello\u2019s rhythmic tapping of the unplugged tip of his guitar cable to make music, like somebody using the board game Operation as an instrument. Gabe Cohn/nAvailable to stream on the Criterion Channel/nMichael Rapaport\u2019s documentary about the groundbreaking rap group A Tribe Called Quest isn\u2019t exactly a concert film per se, but it is bookended by a pair of critical tours: a 2008 run that rapper Q-Tip bitterly declares backstage is its last performance ever, and another in 2010 that sees the trio cautiously reuniting. In between is a vibrant tribute, particularly enhanced after Phife Dawg\u2019s death in 2016, and a no-frills look at the story of a singular group that changed hip-hop, even as success distanced them from one another. Brandon Yu/nAvailable to rent or buy on most major platforms/nIf Shakira\u2019s recent performance at the MTV Video Music Awards impressed you, this 2011 release will floor you. Singing in three languages (often while dancing vigorously) and playing multiple instruments, the Colombian megastar commands the stage with a magnetic intensity. There isn\u2019t much artifice on display here, only Shakira surrendering her entire body to the vitality of her genre-defying, globally inspired music. Take as proof her sensational belly dancing during \u201cOjos As\u00ed\u201d or her transition from tenderness to fury in the rock ballad \u201cInevitable.\u201d Carlos Aguilar/nAdvertisement"

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nThe pop star\u2019s concert film, arriving in theaters on Friday, is expected to break box office records. \u201cThe fever and scale is unprecedented,\u201d one analyst said./nBy Brooks Barnes/nReporting from Los Angeles/nThe world\u2019s biggest pop star, Taylor Swift, is about to become the world\u2019s biggest movie star, at least for a weekend. The only question is whether turnout for her concert film will be enormous or truly colossal./nBox office analysts keep raising opening-weekend estimates for \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d which will arrive in cinemas on Friday evening amid a lightning storm of free publicity. (As you may have heard, Ms. Swift has lately been spending considerable time with Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end.) The nearly three-hour film was initially expected to sell about $75 million in tickets this weekend in the United States and Canada, with analysts reaching that estimate by studying presales and moviegoer surveys. As of Tuesday, the domestic number was looking more like $125 million./nCould it reach $150 million? \u201cYes, it could,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. \u201cThe fever and scale is unprecedented.\u201d/n\u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d which cost Ms. Swift roughly $15 million to make, is expected to collect an additional $60 million overseas \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 over the weekend./n\u201cWe are wonder-struck,\u201d said Wanda Gierhart Fearing, chief marketing and content officer for the Cinemark theater chain, which has a large presence in the southern United States and Latin America. In addition to standard screenings, Cinemark and other multiplex operators have been offering private viewing parties. (That\u2019s $800 for 40 people. Dancing encouraged, but not on seats.)/nThe domestic box office record for a concert film debut is held by \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never,\u201d which Paramount Pictures released in 2011. It collected $41 million over its first three days in North American theaters, adjusted for inflation, and ultimately $101 million in the United States and Canada and $138 million worldwide./n\u201cMichael Jackson\u2019s This Is It,\u201d released by Sony Pictures in 2009, holds the record for total ticket sales. It generated $105 million over its entire North American run, and $380 million worldwide, adjusted for inflation./nBox office analysts aren\u2019t quite sure what to expect from \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d in part because it comes only nine weeks after Ms. Swift concluded the six-month, 53-show initial leg of her sold-out North American tour. The trade publication Pollstar estimated that she had sold about $14 million in tickets each night./nHas the thirst for Ms. Swift among casual fans been satisfied for the time being? To what degree did the cultural frenzy surrounding her Eras concerts pique the curiosity of a broader audience \u2014 people who would never pay hundreds of dollars to see her perform in a stadium but might shell out for movie tickets? (Most seats for the film cost $19.89, a nod to the name of Ms. Swift\u2019s fifth album and her birth year.)/nComplicating predictions, Ms. Swift broke Hollywood norms in getting her film to theaters./nUnder the customary model, studios book movies into theaters and spend anywhere from $20 million to $100 million on marketing to turn out an audience. Theaters play movies and sell concessions. In return, studios collect as much as 70 percent of opening-weekend tickets sales, with theaters keeping the balance./nSince she produced and financed \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d herself, Ms. Swift cut out the middle company (a studio) and made a distribution deal directly with AMC Entertainment, the world\u2019s largest theater operator. One reason involved marketing: Ms. Swift, with 369 million social media followers at her beck and call, barely needs to spend anything to advertise the film./nMs. Swift will keep about 57 percent of ticket revenue, with theater chains pocketing the rest, as first reported by a Puck newsletter. AMC will also receive a modest distribution fee./nBox office forecasting, however, is based on moviegoer surveys that are designed to track the effectiveness of studio marketing campaigns \u2014 older women are not being persuaded by your ads, for example, but teenage boys are in the bag. \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d has had some paid advertising, including a commercial during a Chiefs prime-time game this month. But most movies arrive amid an advertising bombardment./n\u201cOne of the questions involves staying power,\u201d said Bruce Nash, founder of the Numbers, a box office tracking and analytics site. \u201cIs \u2018The Eras Tour\u2019 going to do most of its business on opening weekend and then fall off a cliff? Or will people come back six times over the course of weeks? We have no idea.\u201d/nMs. Swift\u2019s distribution choice made Hollywood gnash its teeth. Studio executives had to explain to their bosses why they missed a prime moneymaking opportunity and a chance to form a relationship with Ms. Swift, who has feature film directing ambitions. (She has also tinkered with acting, including in \u201cCats.\u201d) Universal Pictures, fearing competition from \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d scrambled to move \u201cThe Exorcist: Believer\u201d to an earlier date; ticket sales were soft./nStudios have also had to contend with an existential question: Does distribution for \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d mark the start of a paradigm shift? Are more movies going to bypass studios? Already, Beyonc\u00e9 has followed Ms. Swift in making a deal with AMC to distribute her concert documentary, \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d which will arrive in theaters on Dec. 1./nAnything is possible. Mr. Nash noted that Fathom Events, an independent distributor that specializes in short-run screenings and simulcast opera performances, has found increasing success in taking faith-based projects (\u201cThe Chosen\u201d) directly to theaters. Trafalgar Releasing found a studio-skipping hit in February with a concert film focused on BTS, the South Korean boy band./nBut most studio executives and entertainment industry analysts dismiss \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d as a one-off. When it comes to mobilizing a fan base, Ms. Swift, they say, is in a class by herself. Even Beyonc\u00e9 has not shown the same selling power. First-day presales for \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d totaled an estimated $37 million, while \u201cRenaissance\u201d generated about $7 million./nAt the moment, theater chains aren\u2019t thinking much beyond the weekend. The last two months have been quiet for theaters, with hits like \u201cThe Nun II\u201d (Warner Bros.) offset by a string of duds, including \u201cDumb Money,\u201d \u201cBlue Beetle,\u201d \u201cThe Creator\u201d and \u201cExpend4bles.\u201d/nTwo major movies originally expected this fall, \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d were pushed into next year because of the actors\u2019 strike. (Until the strike is resolved, SAG-AFTRA, as the actors\u2019 union in known, has barred its members from engaging in any publicity efforts for films and TV shows that have already been completed.)/nTheater companies, of course, make most of their money at the concession counter, and AMC, for one, is counting on Ms. Swift\u2019s fans to come hungry. Among other items, the chain plans to sell popcorn in collectible tubs for $20./nMarketing line: \u201cSwifties always snack in style.\u201d/nBrooks Barnes covers all things Hollywood.

    "content": "Swifties continue to help prop up the 2023 box office, as Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour tops $230 million, taking the #2 spot at the weekend box office with $13.6 million. And the worldwide popularity of the music artist could provide a big benefit for The Marvels next weekend./nGLENDALE, ARIZONA - MARCH 17: (Editorial use only and no commercial use at any time.  No use on ... [+] publication covers is permitted after August 9, 2023.) Taylor Swift performs onstage for the opening night of \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at State Farm Stadium on March 17, 2023 in Swift City, ERAzona (Glendale, Arizona). The city of Glendale, Arizona was ceremonially renamed to Swift City for March 17-18 in honor of The Eras Tour. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nOff just $2 million from last weekend \u2014 a spectacular 88% hold \u2014 Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is on track for $250 million worldwide by the end of its historic run. No doubt the arrival of The Marvels will draw away some of the primary audience demographics for The Eras Tour, but on the other hand theaters featuring both films might benefit from Swifties deciding to make it a \u201cdouble feature\u201d night by seeing both films together, while walking out of The Marvels might have viewers flying high enough to choose a \u201cdouble feature\u201d approach by dropping in on The Eras Tour afterward./nWith The Marvels tracking to a $130-150 million worldwide opening according to recent data, any boost from Taylor Swift\u2019s film and fans would be a welcome turn of events. Indeed, I\u2019m surprised Marvel didn\u2019t attempt to make a deal with Swift to help promote The Marvels by attending the premiere in LA and endorsing it, while getting theaters to promote \u201cdouble feature\u201d screenings of the films together as \u201cTaylor Swift: The Marvels Tour\u201d or some such marketing./nSwift is savvy and could get a lucrative deal for some opening weekend dollars, support for her own film in Marvel\u2019s marketing for The Marvels, and maybe a promise to get her into the MCU in a prominent role. Dazzler is the common favorite answer, but I\u2019d argue she\u2019s a strong contender for Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Emma Frost, Magik, and any number of others as well./nBut even without overt promotional tie-ins and endorsements, fans on both sides of this equation might be inclined to feed one another\u2019s energy at the box office this weekend, showing up in groups and wearing their respective merchandise, with plenty of overlap between the two groups and likely at least a decent number who\u2019ve already seen both films or plan to./nSo there might be some instant synergy built into this equation that standard tracking doesn\u2019t tell us about, although obviously this is speculation on my part and would also probably include lost audience to both films due to the competition, so the question would be which film benefits more from either and both influences./nThat said, I feel the early positive reactions to The Marvels coupled with its fast pacing and under-two-hours runtime will create a unique environment at the box office this weekend. The top two films could be \u2014 or are likely to be \u2014 women-driven releases accounting for the overwhelming majority of people at the box office this weekend. I say that because I feel pretty confident Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour will wind up in second place again this weekend due to overall stronger holds than the rest of the competition./nSo with Taylor Swift the leading contender to take the silver medal this weekend, and what that means for a box office that could be dominated by women-led audiences overall (when the total percentage of women is tallied up, particularly for the top five), I feel there\u2019s some reason to feel hopeful that the weekend turns out better at the box office than early reports suggest. If they haven\u2019t already, both camps \u2014 Swift and Marvel \u2014 should be looking at how promoting one another\u2019s films would probably be helpful to boost both\u2019s chances, even without any official coordination./nLongterm, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour could potentially add to its $250 million final tally (where I believe it will finish its run), if Swift makes another deal to return her film to theaters around Christmas if the rest of the competition is stumbling or underperforming (as I think at least one or two will, unfortunately from a box office standpoint). If that window of opportunity opens, then Swift could wind up seeing a final 2023 box office cume in the neighborhood of $300 million for The Eras Tour./nBut even without such a rerelease, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is already an incredible success and has established the groundwork for an entirely new approach to concert films and distribution. Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9 will seek to replicate the success, or some degree of it depending on the details of release, when it hits theaters December 1st. The timing and epic scope of the film could help ensure Renaissance is another blockbuster concert film, proving the genre has definitely taken a major turn in prominence and potential in the theatrical marketplace./nThis could, should, and hopefully will spawn a whole new interest and approach to concert moviemaking, including more immersive experiences, exclusive experiences, live experiences, and approaches expanding the creation and use of spaces such as The Sphere in Las Vegas./nIt would be wonderful to see this sort of emergence of concerts and musical experiences as a major new part of theatrical, and in turn it would obviously have all sorts of positive influences on the expansion and technical evolution of theaters, projection, seating, sound, and how we directly or indirectly interact with the storytelling./nAnd on the flip side, it would be amazing to witness the ways music and concerts and interactive live performances evolve and turn into deeper multi-layered storytelling by necessity, a process enhanced by as well as even partially driven by specific changes to filming and distribution and platforms that the films themselves necessitate, and so on./nWhatever the future, this weekend it will be all about The Marvels, and Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour could play either a mild spoiler role or the role of booster. It will be interesting to see which way things turn out, and I\u2019ll be back with updates on how it all plays out. Meanwhile, be sure to check out my article this week about reports of Marvel Studios\u2019 supposedly out of control downturn./n"

The divide shrank in 32 states./nLeading the pack was Wisconsin, which shrank its gap by 11 points. Connecticut\u2019s gap contracted 10.4 points and Rhode Island 7.2. The lowest contractions were found in New Mexico where its gap widened by 7 points, followed by Arizona up 5.8, and Indiana up 5.1./nLet\u2019s start with job counts because the opportunity to get a paycheck is just as critical as the pay itself./nCalifornia employed the most women \u2013 5.6 million in 2021, 11% of the nation\u2019s 51 million.

The ongoing actor\u2019s strike prompted studios to postpone six major fall releases like \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and Sony\u2019s \u201cGhostbusters: Afterlife\u201d sequel, a loss that analysts predict could cost the movie business $1.6 billion in worldwide box office receipts./nAnd the box office in North America is still recovering from its prepandemic heights, down about 17 percent from 2019 when 16 more films were released in theaters./nThe Taylor Swift film, which cost around $15 million to make, opened in 3,855 theaters in the United States and Canada. (Ms. Swift added a preview night of screenings on Thursday in 2,700 theaters to accommodate the seemingly insatiable demand for everything Taylor. Those showings grossed $2.8 million.)/nThe film earned an additional estimated $31 million to $33 million across 94 international territories in over 4,500 theaters, putting its global receipts at $126 million to $130 million. It will expand to additional international locations in the coming weeks./nCulled from the six nights she performed at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles in early August, the film features some 40 songs and covers her past 10 albums. The whole movie takes place onstage with no behind-the-scenes or backstage footage included./nMs. Swift bypassed the traditional studio system, partnering directly with AMC Theaters to distribute the film, just nine weeks after her domestic concert tour ended. There was little traditional marketing support for the movie. Instead, Ms. Swift communicated directly with her 350 million social media followers. She will begin the international leg of her tour in February, in many of the same places where the movie is playing./nAs part of the deal with AMC, Ms. Swift earns 57 percent of ticket revenue, meaning she walked away from the weekend with around $55 million, not including her cut from international sales. With tickets costing $19.89 (in homage to her birth year) for adults and $13.13 (her favorite number) for children ages 2 to 12 and people 60 and older, the film is still a boon for theaters, which are encouraging the celebration with relaxed cellphone policies, specially licensed popcorn tubs, friendship bracelet-making stands and even some custom drinks. A theater in Boise, Idaho, is selling Taylor Swift nonalcoholic beverages, like a maple latte titled the \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d in honor of Ms. Swift\u2019s 10-minute ballad./n\u201cEras Tour\u201d is easily the biggest concert film opening ever. The previous record-holder was the Paramount Pictures\u2019 release in 2011 of \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never,\u201d which made $41 million over its first three days in North American theaters, adjusted for inflation, and ultimately $101 million in the United States and Canada and $138 million worldwide./n\u201cMichael Jackson\u2019s This Is It,\u201d released by Sony Pictures in 2009, holds the record for total ticket sales. It generated $105 million over its entire North American run, and $380 million worldwide, adjusted for inflation./nBeyonc\u00e9 made a similar deal with AMC, and her concert film \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9\u201d will open on Dec. 1./nMany in the movie industry are now wondering how long Ms. Swift, who confirmed her ubiquitous presence by making a cameo appearance on the season premiere of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d will keep her audience coming to the theaters./n\u201cWe\u2019re going to assume the box office will double from here, but there\u2019s no precedent for this; we\u2019re in uncharted territory,\u201d David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers, wrote in his recent analysis./nAdding to its unique nature, the film will only run on Thursdays through Sundays./nElizabeth Frank, the executive vice president in charge of programming at AMC, said in a statement on Sunday that because of \u201ctremendous recommendations and fans buying tickets to see this concert film several times,\u201d she expected the film would play \u201cto big audiences for weeks to come.\u201d/nThe next big film to open is Martin Scorsese\u2019s three-hour epic \u201cKillers of a Flower Moon,\u201d which will debut in over 3,000 theaters next weekend. Yet, the western thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone isn\u2019t likely to see its audience overlap much with \u201cEras,\u201d which, according to exit polls, skewed 78 percent female. The next likely blockbuster on the docket is Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cThe Marvels\u201d starring Brie Larson.

Then came the internet./nBy Madison Malone Kircher/nEverything has changed for Bryan West./nGannett, the largest newspaper chain in the United States, announced on Monday that Mr. West would fill a much-coveted job as the company\u2019s first-ever Taylor Swift reporter, covering all things related to the international pop sensation for USA Today and Gannett\u2019s network of more than 200 other papers across the country./nBut before Mr. West, 35, had the chance to file his first story on his new beat, he was getting criticism from two sides: journalism watchdogs and Ms. Swift\u2019s fans./nThe objections started rolling in shortly after Variety broke the news of his hiring on Monday. The article included an interview with Mr. West, which provided newsroom ethicists and Swifties alike with grounds for complaint./nMr. West, who was formerly a TV news reporter in Phoenix, raised hackles by describing himself as \u201ca fan of Taylor.\u201d That remark caused some journalists to question whether or not he could be unbiased when it came to his new beat. At the same time, the singer\u2019s fans debated whether he was a big enough Swiftie to capture their beloved star. Some people in both camps said the job was better suited to a woman./nIn the Variety interview, Mr. West likened himself to a sports reporter in making the case that he could maintain his neutrality. \u201cI would say this position\u2019s no different than being a sports journalist who\u2019s a fan of the home team,\u201d he said. \u201cI just came from Phoenix, and all of the anchors there were wearing Diamondbacks gear; they want the Diamondbacks to win.\u201d/nThat remark did not sit well with a number of sportswriters, including Frankie de la Cretaz, a Boston-based sports and culture journalist./n\u201cAny sports journalist will tell you the No. 1 rule of sports journalism is no cheering in the press box,\u201d Mx. de la Cretaz, 38, said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hallmarks of the profession. It\u2019s one of the first things you learn. The idea, of course, being that if you are a fan of the team, that you can\u2019t be an unbiased reporter.\u201d/n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I necessarily think that\u2019s true,\u201d they continued, \u201cbut I think the fact that he is making that comparison shows to me a fundamental misunderstanding of what the role of a sports journalist is.\u201d/nBenjamin Goggin, an editor at NBC News, criticized the hiring of Mr. West on X, writing that Gannett had given the job to \u201ca full stan, rather than someone who is capable of being critical of one of the most powerful people in all of pop culture.\u201d/n\u201cHaters gonna hate,\u201d Lark-Marie Ant\u00f3n, Gannett\u2019s chief communications officer, wrote in an email, replying to the criticism from journalists. The spokeswoman added Mr. West\u2019s credentials \u201cmade him the best candidate for this role.\u201d (Mr. West, who is now based in Nashville, at a Gannett daily, The Tennessean, declined to be interviewed for this article.)/nApril Glick Pulito, a Swift fan who works in political communications, posted lyrics from a Taylor Swift song in response to the hiring: \u201cI\u2019m so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I\u2019d get there quicker if I was a man?,\u201d Ms. Pulito, 35, wrote on X, quoting \u201cThe Man,\u201d which reimagines the singer\u2019s life had she been born a man./n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a statement on the chops of this reporter,\u201d Ms. Pulito said in an interview. \u201cHe seems extremely qualified. But as someone who works in communications, I think the optics of the choice are kind of undeniable.\u201d She would have preferred to see the role go to a female applicant, \u201csomeone so many Taylor fans could look up to and see themselves in,\u201d she said./nThe Gannett spokeswoman said the company \u201cdoes not discriminate.\u201d/nIn a year when seemingly anything having to do with the singer has drawn media scrutiny, Gannett\u2019s announcement that it planned to hire a dedicated Taylor Swift reporter generated plenty of headlines and online comments./nThe chosen candidate, the company said when it launched the search in September, would \u201cidentify why the pop star\u2019s influence only expands\u201d and \u201cwhat her fan base stands for in pop culture.\u201d (The company also announced a search for a similar role to cover Beyonc\u00e9.)/nAs part of his application, Mr. West submitted a five-minute video listing the reasons he should be hired. The first was his journalism experience. Mr. West previously worked as a broadcast reporter and producer at an NBC affiliate in Phoenix and said he had won several awards./nHis second reason was that he had met Ms. Swift. The opportunity to meet her arose after he reported several stories about Ms. Swift while working in Phoenix, he said. Mr. West included a photo of him with the singer in the video./nIn his application, Mr. West added that, though he might be a fan, he was able to report on Ms. Swift without bias. He listed three songs he \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d as evidence, including the track \u201cIt\u2019s Nice to Have a Friend.\u201d/nInitially, Variety quoted Mr. West as having named the song as \u201cIt\u2019s Good to Have a Friend,\u201d a mistake on the publication\u2019s part, which alarmed a number of Swifties, who inferred that he wasn\u2019t up to the task./nMr. West also noted that he was five years sober. \u201cI\u2019ll never fail a drug test,\u201d he said in his video application. On his personal website, Mr. West posted an essay that goes into detail about leading Phoenix police officers on a car chase and serving jail time for a drunken-driving charge in 2018. \u201cBryan has been forthcoming disclosing his personal journey,\u201d the Gannett spokeswoman wrote in an email./nLauren Lipman, 32, was one of the applicants who didn\u2019t get the job. Ms. Lipman, a Los Angeles-based content creator, has made a career out of posting videos predominantly about Ms. Swift. In September, Ms. Lipman received an email from a Gannett recruiter to discuss the role further, but ultimately was not called for additional interviews. (Gannett declined to comment on Ms. Lipman\u2019s application process.)/nWhile she was disappointed to lose out on the role, Ms. Lipman wished Mr. West the best of luck. \u201cI\u2019m bummed, but I\u2019m honestly, truly so excited that this position even exists. Like, go, Bryan,\u201d she said./nThough critical of Mr. West\u2019s reference to how sports journalists go about their jobs, Mx. de la Cretaz said they had sympathy for Gannett\u2019s splashy hire./n\u201cThis is a brutal fan base, and I don\u2019t think there was ever going to be any winning for whoever they hired into this role,\u201d Mx. de la Cretaz said. \u201cEither he doesn\u2019t get respect from the general public because he\u2019s a fan and seen as biased or he doesn\u2019t get respect from the fandom itself because he\u2019s not the right kind of fan.\u201d/nBill Grueskin, a professor and former dean at the Columbia Journalism School, said that Mr. West\u2019s passion for his subject could yield fine reporting. He also threw some cold water on Mr. West\u2019s critics within the field./n\u201cI think expecting journalists to completely suspend any kind of personal liking for a pop star or a baseball team is probably unworkable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key is kind of how you go about covering it.\u201d/nGannett has yet to announce who will be covering the Beyonc\u00e9 beat./nMadison Malone Kircher is a reporter for The Times.\u00a0She writes about the internet for the Styles desk.

    "content": "SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA - NOVEMBER 28:  Taylor Swift performs during her '1989' World Tour at ANZ Stadium ... [+] on November 28, 2015 in Sydney, Australia.  (Photo by Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images)/nFans only need to wait about a month and a half before they get a new album from Taylor Swift. The global superstar is planning on dropping the re-recorded edition of 1989, now titled 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), on October 27. As that date looms, it\u2019s worth wondering which of the tunes from the set will become hits again, or perhaps for the first time. One track is already earning the spotlight, and it might become another major win for the singer./nSwift formally announced 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) at the last stop in America (for now) on her The Eras Tour several weeks ago. She told the crowd at SoFi Stadium, and thus the rest of the world, that the re-recorded album was coming in a part of the show when she plays two tunes that aren\u2019t normally featured in the setlist. This moment mixes things up and makes the shows interesting for Swift and the audience. She chose to reveal the upcoming set and then play a tune from the original 1989, \u201cNew Romantics.\u201d Now, that cut may have another shot at becoming huge./n\u201cNew Romantics\u201d was released as the seventh and final single from 1989. It was originally only featured on the deluxe version of the album, and it wasn\u2019t promoted heavily, as Swift had already been pushing the pop album for years by that point. The tune performed only alright, only rising to No. 46 on the Hot 100, failing to even break into the top 40 region./nIn the years since then, \u201cNew Romantics\u201d has become a fan favorite. It is regularly singled out by many die-hard supporters of Swift as a beloved 1989 composition that never got what it deserved. Now, Swift has the chance to change that and potentially score another hit with the upbeat and catchy cut./nThe fact that \u201cNew Romantics\u201d will forever be associated with the incredibly exciting reveal of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) might be enough for it to rise even higher on the Hot 100 when it\u2019s released as \u201cNew Romantics (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d It now holds an even more special place in the hearts of fans than it did a month ago, and millions will forever associate it with that thrilling moment when Swift revealed the cover and release date of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)./nThere is plenty of precedence to suggest that many of the songs on 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) might outperform their predecessors. A number of cuts originally released on earlier albums, now re-recorded and re-titled, have gone on to peak higher than the first takes./nFor example, \u201cAll Too Well\u201d was a medium-sized chart win for the singer more than a decade ago from her album Red. It was always beloved by fans and critics alike, but wasn\u2019t a huge hit during its initial run. When it was re-released with Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) as an extended cut, its lore made it a No. 1 smash on the Hot 100./nRecent electronically produced pop hits from Swift like \u201cCruel Summer\u201d and even the \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d cut from Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) \u201cMessage in a Bottle\u201d both proved their popularity when they hit the Hot 100 as well. There is a desire for that kind of radio-ready pop sound that she dabbles in from time to time, and \u201cNew Romantics\u201d ranks as among the best examples of that style when it comes to Swift\u2019s back catalog./nThere\u2019s no word yet on what Swift plans on doling out as a single from 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), or if she\u2019s going that route at all. If she does push \u201cNew Romantics\u201d as a single again, it will almost surely rise higher than it did the first time around./nIf she doesn\u2019t do so, \u201cNew Romantics\u201d may still debut and peak in a loftier spot than the original take. Interest in all things Swift, especially this re-recordings project, is at an all-time high. Pair that with a seemingly never-ending love for 1989 and its songs, and it's a recipe for success for all the tracks on the album, including some fan favorites./n"

Some estimates suggest that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s world tour could gross even more than that by the time it wraps in October./nOpen this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS./nIt is the latest \u2014 and some economists think final \u2014 iteration of the \u201crevenge spending\u201d trend that took hold after the pandemic, in which people shifted their spending away from goods and toward experiences. Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 fans have been shelling out on everything from secondhand tickets that cost more than a flight to Europe to fancy fingernails to match the singers\u2019 wardrobe./nWhile event spending overall is still just recovering to prepandemic levels, the marquee concerts this summer are spurring a lot of consumption./nThe survey company QuestionPro estimates that Ms. Swift\u2019s concert could generate some $4.6 billion in economic activity in North America alone, taking into account both stadium capacity and people\u2019s reported spending plans on things like tickets, merchandise and travel. That would be roughly on par with the revenues the Beijing Olympics generated in 2008, after adjusting for inflation. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s shows are expected to spur $4.5 billion in spending, based on a separate QuestionPro survey./nIt isn\u2019t just tickets that have motivated people to open their wallets. They are staying in hotel rooms, buying elaborate outfits, spending on flashy manicures and attending sideline parties that are generating business and boosting spending in host cities./nShade Hotel, in Manhattan Beach, Calif., held a Taylor Swift pre-party where guests sported costumes, wore Swift-themed temporary tattoos and sipped on a signature \u201cLavender Haze\u201d cocktail, a reference to one of the most popular songs on her latest album. Both the hotel and its neighbors reported surging demand that pushed up room rates and sold out many properties./nBoxie Studio in Los Angeles, which offers small photo studios of carefully curated backdrops for social media, was selling tickets that allowed visitors to film TikToks or snap Instagram shots in rooms that mirrored Taylor Swift music video sets. Props included the red scarf made famous by the song \u201cAll Too Well\u201d and an \u201cI love you\u201d sign like the one that a lovelorn Ms. Swift flashed at her next-door neighbor in one 2009 music video./nKnock-on effects from the concerts have drawn the attention of national economic authorities: Sweden\u2019s statistics agency said that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s tour helped to fuel inflation there, and a Federal Reserve survey of business contacts reported that Swifties had bolstered hotel revenues in the Philadelphia region./nWhile concert-related spending has not been concentrated enough to show up clearly in national data in the United States, some think it could help to slightly improve the odds of a gentle cool-down instead of an abrupt stop to economic activity. The events are keeping consumers active during a summer when shrinking savings might have otherwise slowed their spending./n\u201cI think Taylor Swift is great for the soft landing,\u201d said Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School. /n\u201cThe Beyonc\u00e9 tour, the Eras tour, are the latest instance of that phenomenon,\u201d he said \u2014 and possibly the tail end, as consumers exhaust pandemic savings and return to more normal patterns. \u201cIt might be that Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 timed their tours perfectly.\u201d/nThe concerts have become a big boost for local tourism, as the Fed report hinted. Airbnb reported that Cincinnati was the platform\u2019s top trending destination for July 4 weekend travel \u2014 beating out places like Mykonos island in Greece and the Amalfi Coast in Italy. The Ohio city hosted Ms. Swift that weekend./nThe shows have also driven broader consumer spending in cities like New York, where searches for lounges, aestheticians and nail technicians in the week leading up to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s performance in East Rutherford, N.J., saw triple-digit percentage increases compared to the year before, according to an analysis by Yelp. Concertgoers were also booking their hair and nail appointments weeks out./nRaven Voorhees, the owner of Free Edge Beauty Studio in Brooklyn, said she spent the month of July doing nails for clients attending Beyonc\u00e9 concerts in cities like Philadelphia, Nashville and East Rutherford. Her clients requested nails that aligned with the theme of the Renaissance tour: lots of silver, metallic, gold and sparkle./n\u201cIt\u2019s boosting business,\u201d Ms. Voorhees said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about someone who\u2019s paying about $60 max for her service to now $150 because she\u2019s doing a new set, she\u2019s getting the works, all of the nail art and then, even after that, having to come back and having to do it again.\u201d/n Tara Lewis, who analyzes Yelp\u2019s data around the \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 bump,\u201d said she had seen \u201cpops in every city\u201d which gives her confidence that Beyonc\u00e9 is the reason behind the lift./nAmerica\u2019s hot concert summer has been enabled, in large part, by a hot job market. Unemployment is low and wages are rising, which is helping people afford big purchases like tickets and pricey hotel rooms./nIn a survey fielded for The New York Times, QuestionPro found that about 50 percent of Taylor Swift fans used regular income to buy tickets and outfits, while 9 percent used savings built up during the pandemic. A bigger share used savings amassed before or after the public health crisis or relied on family help. Just a small share \u2014 4 percent \u2014 borrowed money to afford the tickets./nBeyonc\u00e9 fans also funded tickets heavily out of their income, and spent $1,800 on average for the concert./nMany companies have figured out how to capitalize on the hype. Ahead of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s New Jersey appearance, Circle Line Cruise \u2014 a New York staple known for ferrying tourists around Manhattan \u2014 transformed into a dance floor where boat riders learned the Renaissance concert choreography. The 78-year-old cruise line has been trying to find ways to attract new customers and give locals a reason to step on board, said Alexis Melendez, Circle Line\u2019s marketing director./nThe event, which took place the Thursday before Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s MetLife performances, sold out. The three-level cruise ship held about 300 people who had paid $25 for the two-hour ride where attendees grooved to a D.J. playing Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s thirty-year discography and followed directions from the dance instructor Byron Freeman./nCircle Line doubled the amount of bartenders, who were making $16 Beyonc\u00e9 themed cocktails with names like \u201cAlien Supermarg\u201d and \u201cRum the World.\u201d/nIn Los Angeles, companies also seized on Taylor Swift\u2019s concerts to host branded activities. Truly LA, a venue showcasing the hard seltzer brand, hosted a friendship-bracelet making event on the sidelines of Taylor Swift concerts./nSwifties wear and trade the jewelry as a reference to a lyric in a song from Ms. Swift\u2019s latest album, in which she instructs listeners to \u201cmake the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it.\u201d The events, which took place on Aug. 2 and Aug. 3, also encouraged attendees to trade their bracelets while listening to Ms. Swift and consuming specialty seltzer drinks./nTara Vasquez, 39, stood outside of the Beyonc\u00e9 show in late July in sparkling bejeweled eye make up, explaining that she has \u201ca credit card for Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d She has gone to shows in each Beyonc\u00e9 tour dating back to Destiny\u2019s Child, she said./n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is a splurge because she understands me; We grew up together,\u201d she said./n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 says show up, and we show up,\u201d she said. The artist has not released a visual album with Renaissance like she had for her previous albums, but Ms. Vasquez said: \u201cWe are the visual.\u201d/n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 got a lot of money out of me: At this point, I\u2019m going to claim her as a dependent on my taxes,\u201d Kalen Allen, 27, said outside of the MetLife stadium as he prepared to see Renaissance for the second night in a row. Professionally styled in a red and black ensemble, he estimated that he was spending $15,000 across multiple shows in multiple cities./nBibi Peterson, 16, was attending Taylor Swift\u2019s concerts in Los Angeles three times \u2014 including on Aug. 4 with her grandmother, brother and other family members. Her outfit cost her only about $25 in materials from Amazon, she estimated, because her grandmother sewed it. It was meant to look like the outfit Ms. Swift wore while singing \u201cHow You Get the Girl\u201d during a previous tour, complete with glow lights./n\u201cAs a young woman, she really inspires me,\u201d Ms. Peterson said. \u201cI love just watching her go out there and shimmer.\u201d/nWith thousands of people descending on stadiums across the country, transportation to the summer\u2019s big concerts also became an enterprise./nThe founders of Foolonia, a New York-based event company founded in 2019 that focuses on providing inclusive spaces and unique outings, decided to offer group transit to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s New Jersey concert. The entry fee was $100 and included Beyonc\u00e9 trivia, giveaways like official tour merchandise and enough space to practice dance moves. /n\u201cHave we done a party bus before? No! But that\u2019s what we do,\u201d said Riley Wilson, a co-founder of the company. \u201cWe do divergent experiences.\u201d/nAnd in Los Angeles, public transit stayed open late to ferry concertgoers. \u201cWe\u2019re enchanted that Taylor Swift fans have given a big boost to public transit across the United States this year \u2014 and we\u2019re looking forward to spending our midnights with many of you very soon,\u201d the city\u2019s metro system punned on its website \u2014 referencing Ms. Swift\u2019s song \u201cEnchanted\u201d and her recent album \u201cMidnights.\u201d/nSpending on the concerts may partly be taking the place of other events, vacations and consumption in general this summer: About half of respondents in both the Taylor Swift and the Beyonc\u00e9 QuestionPro surveys said they would cut back elsewhere to afford the experiences, with many reporting that they were eating out less or skipping unnecessary entertainment./nMany attendees made it clear that having fun at the tours would be their priority./n\u201cPeople are looking to experience a fun and groundbreaking way to celebrate their identity, to celebrate music,\u201d said Ozzie Henderson, a co-founder of Foolonia and a Beyonc\u00e9 fan who started putting together his concert outfit since she announced her tour. \u201cThey\u2019re investing their money in a great experience.\u201d/nAudio produced by Adrienne Hurst./nJeanna Smialek writes about the Federal Reserve and the economy for The Times.

That's right, NFL fans, get ready for LOTS of luxury box shots of the folks./nET was first to report the news of the family jamboree, and it makes a lot of sense. Of course, you'll remember from the last Super Bowl -- Travis plays for the Chiefs and his older bro Jason is an Eagles star./nHere's how the families get involved -- Taylor's dad is a massive Eagles fan, although his devotion seems to have cracked due to his daughter's new bae ... Scott was wearing a Chiefs lanyard while bonding with Travis at Tay's Argentina show./nOn their podcast, Travis boasted to Jason ... \"Got him over to the good side, baby,\" referring to Scott Swift's apparent switch. He piled on by adding, \"Just one by one, getting all the good ones to come on over.\" Yes, Taylor was also once a diehard Eagles fan./nIn a direct message to Scott, Jason asked: \"What are we doing, Scott? You're gonna let this man's devilish good looks and relationship with your daughter sway you from a lifetime of fandom, Scott? Ridiculous.\"/nMeanwhile, we already know Taylor has hit it off with Donna -- they've hung out at Chiefs games -- and Trav's mom was recently watching the \"Eras\" tour film in a theater when a Swiftee spotted her./nOf course, Travis will be on the field for MNF, but the big question is whether Taylor will make it for the game. She's got shows in Rio de Janeiro on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We know her private jet could get her to Kansas City in time for kickoff."

    "content": "Last weekend, the Kansas City Chiefs dominated the Chicago Bears 41-10. Despite his three touchdown passes, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wasn\u2019t the star of the show. In fact, it wasn\u2019t any of the players on the field./nIt was Taylor Swift who captured the attention of the cameras, announcers and seemingly everyone else with a pulse. Swift, who was sitting in a suite with the mother of Chiefs star Travis Kelce, captivated the audience with nothing but her presence.\u00a0/nIn the weeks prior to the game, rumors started to circulate that Kelce and Swift were dating. Swift\u2019s appearance at the game all but confirmed those rumors.\u00a0/nIt\u2019s fun to see the birth of a relationship, especially when the two people involved are some of the most popular figures in their respective fields. However, the social media posts and news headlines that took over the news cycle for the past week have gotten very old, very quickly./nWhat was an exciting merger of stars has turned into this nonstop production of content that uses the same one-liners to poke fun at the newest power couple. And the media loves it \u2014 they can\u2019t get enough.\u00a0/nThe new couple has gotten so much attention that it seems like some of the most prominent news outlets are prioritizing pushing out material that has any and all information about Kelce and Swift.\u00a0/nThere are actual newsworthy events that are getting pushed to the side in favor of the duo. News about the couple has become so commonplace that it\u2019s become more of a nuisance than entertainment.\u00a0/nThis trend is indicative of the modern state of media and media consumers across the country. Rather than focusing on important events, trivial and inconsequential headlines tend to dominate the headlines.\u00a0/nThis is highlighted by Gannett\u2019s \u2014 one of the largest newspaper chains in the United States \u2014 decision to hire a reporter specifically to cover Swift. Whereas publications typically have a team of reporters dedicated to covering topics like local news, sports or entertainment, there will now be a reporter at publications such as USA Today who will only focus on Swift.\u00a0/nThe relationship has also begun to feel commercialized and seems to be used to promote the products of the two superstars. Following Swift being spotted with Kelce, Kelce\u2019s jersey sales skyrocketed \u2014 increasing by nearly 400%.\u00a0/nSwift, who has a movie based on her Eras Tour in the works and a new re-recorded album coming out later this year, is also unlikely to suffer financially for this latest media stunt.\u00a0/nKelce and Swift are also complicit in this. While some may think that they deserve some privacy as a couple, regardless of their stardom, neither has tried to hide from the attention.\u00a0/nOn his podcast, New Heights, with his brother Jason Kelce, Travis was not afraid to talk about Swift\u2019s appearance at the game. The fact that Kelce is openly discussing the topic on a platform available to the masses shows that the couple doesn\u2019t mind exposing private details about their relationship.\u00a0/nIt\u2019s tough to feel sympathetic for a couple whose combined net worth is more money than most people can fathom. It\u2019s even tougher to feel sympathetic when they themselves are indulging the public\u2019s fascination with their private life.\u00a0/nSwift was also spotted supporting Kelce again in New York as Kelce and the Chiefs faced off against the New York Jets on Sunday night. To celebrate her appearance at the game, NBC aired a monologue from \u201cThe Voice\u201d host Carson Daly explaining what all the media hype is about.\u00a0/nDaly did not forget to make as many references to Swift\u2019s music as he possibly could./nWhile the relationship is certainly interesting and worthy of being talked about, there is a limit on how much we should be talking about it \u2014 and we\u2019ve reached that point.\u00a0/nThis editorial was written by Opinion C0-Editor Brett Abrams/nComments are closed."

    "content": "In September 1993, Adam Duritz and his Bay Area folk-rock band, Counting Crows, released their debut album, \u201cAugust and Everything After,\u201d which went on to sell 7 million copies, spawned an inescapable radio smash in \u201cMr. Jones\u201d and turned the dreadlocked Duritz into one of Hollywood\u2019s most enthusiastic daters of actors (including, as the story goes, two \u201cFriends\u201d cast members in Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox)./nThree decades later, Duritz is still attracting famous and beautiful women./nOn a recent evening, Counting Crows played to a full house at the Troubadour as a means of drumming up excitement for a North American tour that circles back to Inglewood\u2019s YouTube Theater for a show Wednesday night. Among those gathered to hear \u201cMr. Jones,\u201d \u201cA Long December,\u201d \u201cRound Here\u201d and the rest was Cindy Crawford, whom the next morning Duritz insisted he doesn\u2019t actually know./n\u201cA million people came backstage and said, \u2018Cindy Crawford\u2019s at your show!\u2019\u201d the singer, 59, recalled with a laugh in an interview at his West Hollywood hotel. \u201cI was like, \u2018Huh, cool.\u2019\u201d/nFor the current tour, Counting Crows \u2014 with a lineup of original members, longtime players and newer recruits \u2014 are joined by the veteran emo act Dashboard Confessional, whose Chris Carrabba has become a close friend of Duritz\u2019s in New York, where they both live. In May, Duritz and his girlfriend, filmmaker Zoe Mintz, went to see Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour at New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium with Carrabba and his wife./nDuritz\u2019s verdict? \u201cI was floored,\u201d he said./nYou sound surprised.Chris knows her really well, and I was a big fan when she started, but I hadn\u2019t listened to her for about 10 years. My girlfriend is obsessed and she got us tickets and she made me a playlist \u2014 I couldn\u2019t believe how good the \u201cFolklore\u201d and \u201cEvermore\u201d stuff was. A lot of big shows don\u2019t interest me because it just seems like it\u2019s people plus dancers plus whatever. But this was a work of art \u2014 like some combination of Broadway show and Universal theme ride./nI noticed at the Troubadour that you had a music stand with a binder on it. I assume it had song lyrics, but you never once looked at it.I\u2019ve always had a binder with lyrics sitting at the back of the stage under the piano \u2014 just there if I need to look for something. Of course, it\u2019s essentially useless because if I do need to find a lyric, I\u2019m not gonna be able to get under the piano, flip through the binder and find it in time. But after COVID \u2014 I mean, two years was the longest I\u2019d gone without playing a gig since I was a kid. And when we got into rehearsals for that tour, I was like, \u201cF\u2014 hell, I got a lot of lyrics.\u201d You know, \u201cPalisades Park,\u201d that\u2019s like 10 minutes long. I\u2019m like, \u201cHow did I write all this s\u2014? Why did I write all this s\u2014?\u201d So I was just nervous that I wasn\u2019t gonna remember stuff after those two years./n Music /nParrotheads know: Jimmy Buffett was not just a brand, he was a gifted singer-songwriter with a keen understanding of middle age and the American dream./nSept. 2, 2023/nLast night you let the audience take over for the chorus of \u201cMr. Jones.\u201d What are you thinking in those moments?There\u2019s something so galvanizing about an audience singing your song. But \u201cMr. Jones\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s a really high note. I often let the first one go to the audience, but there\u2019s a part of me that thinks: I\u2019m 59 now. They probably think I can\u2019t hit that note anymore. I\u2019m gonna sing the rest of \u2019em myself. But last night I had no voice \u2014 I\u2019m just getting over a chest infection. I knew I wasn\u2019t gonna hit it./nSo the haters were right.In this case, absolutely./nI went back and read some old Counting Crows reviews in The Times. There\u2019s one of a gig you played in Irvine in 1997 that says, \u201cDuritz is one of the few who can make Jackson Browne and Morrissey seem cheery by comparison.\u201dI\u2019m assuming that wasn\u2019t a great review./nIt was not. But does that description square with how you thought of yourself at that time?Well, I had a pretty severe mental illness that I wasn\u2019t talking about publicly back then. I spent a lot of time depressed, and clearly the writer got that. But it\u2019s a weird thing as an artist to have your life judged solely by people who don\u2019t know you \u2014 and with no sympathy, only ridicule. I got myself locked up at the UCLA Medical Center for a little bit [in 2001] because I was having some troubles and just needed to settle things down because I didn\u2019t feel safe. And the day I checked in, Mariah Carey checked out, and I remember the media circus that went on with her and how people made fun of her. That stuck in my head./nHow you feeling these days?Mental illness isn\u2019t like breaking your leg. It\u2019s closer to a handicap than it is to an injury. But at least if you realize what it is, you can spot it when it\u2019s going on. You can go, OK, I\u2019m not crazy \u2014 my mind just does this when this happens. And you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re losing touch with reality. I started to feel safe talking about it around 2008, when we released \u201cSaturday Nights & Sunday Mornings,\u201d because I didn\u2019t feel like I was circling the drain anymore. But I\u2019m not a spokesperson for s\u2014. I don\u2019t really feel the responsibility to be everyone\u2019s flag-bearer for mental illness./n Music /nIn his weird and luscious signature song, Gary Wright, who died Monday at age 80, captured a vision of tomorrow haunted by the memory of yesterday./nSept. 5, 2023/nYou worked at the Viper Room when you moved to L.A. Why was a well-known rock star tending bar?When I got home to North Berkeley from the end of the \u201cAugust\u201d touring \u2014 this is like January of \u201995 \u2014 that first week was kind of a nightmare. There were kids literally camped out on my lawn. I knew [Viper Room owners] Sal [Jenco] and Johnny [Depp], and I got a phone call from them where they started to invite me to something. Then they\u2019re like, \u201cWhoa, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I explained what was going on and they put me on hold. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve fictionalized this somewhat, but in my memory they came back five minutes later and said, \u201cOK, you have a reservation on the 7 o\u2019clock flight from Oakland to Burbank. Someone will pick you up at the airport, and we got you a room at the Bel Age. It\u2019s Kate Moss\u2019 21st birthday \u2014 the Viper Room is closed for the night and we\u2019re having a party. You gotta get out of Berkeley.\u201d So I did, and I kind of never went home again. Stayed at the Bel Age for a while, then got a bungalow at the Sunset Marquis. Eventually Shannon, one of the bartenders, found me this house to rent. I\u2019d go to the Viper every night and hang out. They were the only people I knew, really. At some point, Shannon had to go to the bathroom or something and she\u2019s like, \u201cCan you handle this?\u201d/nDid you know how to make drinks?I learned./nSurely people knew who you were.Which is why it was all the better to be on the other side of the bar. I\u2019m kind of shy, and it gave me something to do. People would come and talk to me and I didn\u2019t have to be wandering around by myself in a crowd. I met girls and I met Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs and Tom Petty and the Hughes Brothers. Everyone that was doing something interesting in L.A. was there./nYet you left L.A. in the early 2000s for New York.I came here from the Bay Area because the struggling artist\u2019s town that I came from wasn\u2019t happy with my success. And L.A. is a working artist\u2019s town. I felt like somebody normal when I got here. But it kind of changed when reality TV came in. There was a culture of famous-for-being-famous that got really tiresome to me. I went to New York and just found myself having more interesting conversations. Mary-Louise Parker is one of my best friends since we were young, and she and Billy Crudup were together then. One night Billy and I went to see No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s \u201cPrivate Lives.\u201d Alan Rickman and Lindsay Duncan were in it. And after the show, we went backstage and had drinks in Alan\u2019s dressing room, then we all went out to dinner and Rosemary Harris came by the table at one point. It was this incredible experience with these older British actors who were really smart and cool, and I just thought, \u201cIf I moved to New York, I could have conversations like this.\u201d/nWhereas here you could hang out with the cast of \u201cLaguna Beach.\u201dOr, like, \u201cThat \u201970s Show.\u201d Who are actually really nice people. Well, the ones that aren\u2019t in jail./nCounting Crows\u2019 first few albums came out on David Geffen\u2019s label. Ever meet him?Yeah, sure \u2014 he was great. After the band blew up, I was summoned out to his house. Got in the car, drove out to PCH, count up to 20,000 or 30,000 or whatever the address was. I ring the doorbell on this wall and eventually this butler guy opens the door: \u201cOh, Mr. Duritz, please come in.\u201d All at once I see the bright greens of the lawn and the blue of the ocean, and there\u2019s Geffen standing at the end of this long pathway. He greets me and we sit on this patio off to the side of the house and they bring lunch to us, which is like a seared tuna salad. I remember this so vividly because each vegetable in the salad was like the greatest vegetable that had ever been. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cDoes he have specialized farming servants who pick each individual tomato?\u201d Just an unreal explosion of salad-ness./nWhat\u2019d you talk about?All kinds of stuff. He told me about leaving New York to drive up to Woodstock with Joni [Mitchell], then realizing the traffic was too much but she\u2019s gonna write a song anyways. He told me about working with Jackson [Browne] early on. You know what really struck me? This is a guy who\u2019s done a lot of great s\u2014 in his career. But in his mind the greatest thing he ever did was the Eagles. I like the Eagles, but I wouldn\u2019t put them at the top. I\u2019m a Flying Burrito Brothers guy, a Gram Parsons guy. But the Eagles sold a gazillion albums and made more money than all the other acts put together. And that was his greatest accomplishment because for him it\u2019s not just a music thing but a business thing. It was his idea: \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t gonna make it on your own \u2014 you should make a band together.\u201d It\u2019s like deciding you should do personal computers and starting Apple./nYou were close with Bob Saget, who died last year. What was the essence of your friendship?I met Bob because my goddaughter\u2019s godmother [Lori Loughlin] was on \u201cFull House.\u201d They\u2019d all come to the shows early on. Everyone who knew Bob thought they were Bob\u2019s best friend. He made you feel that way when you were with him, like you were the most important person in the world. It\u2019s weird: I\u2019ve had people in my life die before, but I\u2019m never gonna get over this one. I\u2019ll be in the middle of something and I\u2019ll just wanna talk to him and realize I\u2019m not going to. It\u2019s kind of devastating./nYou\u2019ve got other friends in comedy. Ever try stand-up?I could never do it. It\u2019s the most death-defying performance art there is. I\u2019m in awe at the speed at which those guys\u2019 minds work. I\u2019m a smart guy, but I got nothing on that./nAt the show last night you had a Badfinger T-shirt on. Now you\u2019re wearing a Sunflower Bean shirt. How much thought do you put into your choice of band shirt?Last night I was going between a bright-red Big Star shirt, the Badfinger one and a Bowie shirt with the art from \u201cSpace Oddity.\u201d I went with what looked good with my pink shoes./nDo you have a ton of band shirts?I don\u2019t have anything else. My biggest bummer about getting on the plane to come here was that my girlfriend bought me a Taylor Swift \u201cMidnights\u201d shirt that just was a little too tight, so I didn\u2019t bring it. I gotta lose a little more weight before I can wear it./nIt\u2019s good to have a goal.It\u2019s literally what I\u2019m working towards: to wear the Tay-Tay shirt./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

    "content": "Inglewood, CA - August 07: Taylor Swift performs during The Eras Tour at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood ... [+] Monday, Aug. 7, 2023. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift recently made headlines after displaying an extraordinary gesture of generosity, one which others in the entertainment industry\u2014and beyond\u2014could learn from./nIn the middle of her The Eras Tour, which just wrapped its first U.S. leg and is headed to Central America very soon, Swift gave everyone who works on the venture a bonus. But these weren't your typical bonuses. She reportedly handed out an astonishing $55 million in gifts, including $100,000 for each truck driver who brings the production from city to city. That\u2019s a \u201clife-changing\u201d sum for people who may make that much in a year, and some from her touring crew spoke out thanking her publicly./nIn another part of the entertainment world, times are especially tough for creative people. Both movies and TV shows are almost completely halted because writers and actors are on strike against the major studios and streaming companies. Those who actually write and star in the shows and films that entertain the world are asking for better treatment, including a say in how AI is used, more money and fair compensation through residuals, among other things./nOn the other side, the big shots in the business are not willing to give in on many points, leaving the money unevenly distributed. They have their reasons as well, but ultimately, the situation is not looking good, and those in power are not winning the PR wars, as they come out appearing to be the bad guy\u2014and if you ask many in Los Angeles, it\u2019s because they are./nSome folks in the movie and TV industries argue that there just isn't enough money to go around, which makes it hard to pay actors and writers more, even if they're struggling to make ends meet. The argument often comes down to the wealthiest people\u2014like top actors, big directors and executives at companies like Netflix\nNFLX\n and Disney\u2014being seen as greedy, with some of them worth hundreds of millions, while writers are struggling to pay their rent./nA CEO who brought home tens of millions and who runs a conglomerate with billions complaining that there simply isn\u2019t enough money to pay writers a few extra dollars isn\u2019t a great way to win over the masses and come out of the situation looking benevolent./nThis is where Swift's actions can teach those in power a lesson. She's at the very top of the music world, the most successful artist in the world, and one of the bestselling of all time and the driving force behind The Eras Tour. While she's a main reason for its success, she also knows it's not all about her./nSwift realizes that her current success is thanks to a lot of people working hard behind the scenes. But she didn't just say thank you. She showed her appreciation in the most practical way possible: with money. She recognized how much everyone's efforts contributed to the tour's incredible production values, rave reviews and historic box office sums, and, considering the immense revenue, decided to share the wealth instead of taking it all for herself./nSwift's The Eras Tour is expected to earn over $1 billion in ticket sales by the time it\u2019s all done, with a large chunk of that\u2014maybe half\u2014going right to her. And it should! People aren\u2019t paying to see a road hand or a truck driver, but she\u2019s very aware of their importance./nSharing some of that wealth, as she did with her crew, seems like a no-brainer. Big CEOs and executives at companies like Netflix could do something similar, giving up a small part of their earnings to make sure everything runs smoothly and the final product is top-notch. This doesn't have to be a big ask. In fact, it seems to be the fairest way to reward talent and ensure things work well./nThose who have the power to resolve the Hollywood strike might want to consider what Swift has done. Her generous actions not only made everyone happy and earned her some well-deserved good will among millions, but those bonuses will surely continue to ensure that her money-printing venture goes well from here on out./nWhile $55 million is a huge sum of money, it is also only a relatively small figure compared to what The Eras Tour is bringing in. In fact, it may be only 10% of what she earns, or maybe 5% (or less!) of the trek\u2019s total box office pull. Could a similar move help put thousands of actors and writers back to work and bring an unfortunate dispute to an end? It's something worth thinking about./n"

    "content": "GLASGOW, SCOTLAND - JUNE 23:  Taylor Swift performs at The SSE Hydro on June 23, 2015 in Glasgow, ... [+] Scotland.  (Photo by Ross Gilmore/Getty Images for TAS)/nTaylor Swift's new album, 1989 (Taylor's Version), is out now, and it's surely headed for a massive debut on the Billboard charts. The set will almost certainly hit No. 1, giving the singer yet another leader on the ranking of the top-consumed albums in the U.S. Chances are some, if not all, of the tunes featured on the full-length will also reach the Hot 100, and there are a handful that deserve this second moment of attention./n1989 was a blockbuster release, producing a number of major hit singles. Three tracks went to No. 1 on the Hot 100, and several others broke into the top 10. While no one can say that the title didn't earn its due, there are several tunes on 1989 that might not have received all the love they could have the first time around. Now, fans have a second shot at propelling certain cuts toward the top of the tally./nThroughout her re-recordings project, several songs originally featured on older Swift albums have performed better after they were re-released, as they had become fan favorites in the years in between when they first arrived and when the singer doled them out again. So, why shouldn't the same happen for some of her 1989 tracks?/n\"Style\" is one of the most memorable songs from 1989, and it was also one of the biggest hits as well. While \"Style\" did break into the top 10 on the Hot 100, it has gained even more of a following in the years since its heyday. Like tunes such as \"All Too Well,\" it would be great to see this cut hit a new high, perhaps even reaching No. 1...though that seems like a longshot./nThe final single from 1989, \"New Romantics,\" was not promoted as heavily as the six official cuts that preceded it. Originally featured as a bonus cut on the album, \"New Romantics\" failed to break into the top 40 on the Hot 100, which is very surprising for a single from the star. Swift played the tune immediately after announcing 1989 (Taylor's Version), so it now holds a very special place in the hearts of millions of Swifties. Turning it into a top 40 hit after all these years would be an incredible moment for the star and her followers./nThree songs from 1989 only missed the Hot 100 by a few spaces when they were first releases, settling for what's called the Bubbling Under Hot 100, which is essentially a 25-spot extension of the main ranking. So far, one of those tracks, \"This Love,\" has been released as a re-recording. \"This Love (Taylor's Version)\" finally reached the main chart after nearly a decade, peaking at No. 50. Now, it's time for the new takes on both \"All You Had to Do Was Stay\" and \"How You Get the Girl\" to do the same./nOf course, there are many other tracks from 1989, as well as a handful of new ones that have been added to 1989 (Taylor's Version), that will also likely hit the Hot 100 after the set has enjoyed a full tracking week. And fans of the singer all have their own favorites that they're hoping to push up the charts as well. How each tune performs will be announced by Billboard in a few days, but chances are most of the tracks on the title will make it to the Hot 100, even if they didn\u2019t muster that performance the first time around./n"

The album claims the top spot on the ranking of the most-consumed releases in the U.S., boasting a debut of over 1.6 million equivalent units\u2014a career-best and the largest opening of 2023./nWhile many anticipated a second consecutive week of dominance for Swift, an unexpected contender from the world of K-pop is making a formidable play for the chart's highest echelon./nInitially, music industry-focused publication HitsDailyDouble predicted an easy second week at No. 1 for Swift's 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) on the Billboard 200. However, updated projections from the outlet now reveal that the pop sensation is facing more robust competition than first expected./nJung Kook's inaugural solo album, Golden, is currently slated to debut at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, but there's a twist in the tale. The album's predicted first-week opening sum is on the rise, whereas 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) has not changed in days. This unexpected development may bring the two albums closer in the race than initially anticipated./nHitsDailyDouble now predicts that Golden will launch in the runner-up position on the Billboard 200 with 200,000 equivalent units. That\u2019s up significantly from the outlet's initial projection of 160,000 equivalent units. The bulk of those units will likely be comprised of pure sales, likely making Jung Kook's album the top-selling title in the nation next week, even if it doesn\u2019t clinch the summit on the chart./nAs of now, it appears that Golden could miss the No. 1 spot by a mere 25,000 equivalent units. While this might seem substantial, considering the two albums are set to shift at least 200,000 units each, it\u2019s not that massive./nJung Kook has less than a full day to make up ground, as the tracking week ends on Thursday, November 9 at 11:59 PM EST. It's likely he'll secure the runner-up position on the Billboard 200, which will still be a big win for him and his album. However, these are just predictions, and actual numbers reported by Billboard in the coming days could reveal different outcomes for a variety of reasons./n"

(Photo by Drew A. Kelley, Contributing Photographer)\n/n/nI\u2019ve witnessed my longtime friend Lori Totten, of Brea, and her soon-to-be 19-year-old daughter Tiffany go to extraordinary lengths to join the millions of fans that scored tickets to see Swift out on her The Eras Tour. I was with Lori on a trip to Boston in 2019, sitting at an Italian restaurant and waiting for our dinner, when she manically tried to purchase tickets on her phone to Swift\u2019s Lover Fest, the ill-fated 2020 outing in support of Swift\u2019s seventh studio album, \u201cLover.\u201d That would have played off as the first big concert at the all-new SoFi Stadium that year had it not been for the COVID-19 pandemic./nI just also happened to be with her and two of our girlfriends on a trip to Big Bear when Swift dropped her latest album, \u201cMidnights,\u201d last year. We stayed up to listen to the album through and through in our cozy cabin as the clock struck midnight./nWhen The Eras Tour went on sale last year and the overwhelming amount of fans crashed the Ticketmaster website, Lori and her longtime friend Andrea Ramos of Yorba Linda were both frantically attempting to score tickets to any and every show. By some divine stroke of luck \u2014 and hours and hours with no bathroom breaks \u2014 Ramos was able to pick up tickets for the Totten ladies, herself, and her 18-year-old daughter Emma, to Swift\u2019s concert on May 5 in Nashville, Tennessee. After more stress and haggling, the two now-very-savvy ticket-buying women were finally able to secure tickets to a show closer to home and bought passes to see Swift at SoFi Stadium on the first night of the tour on Thursday, Aug. 3, too. The Totten\u2019s are also going to the shows on Aug. 7-9 and Ramos women are headed to Aug. 7 and 9, too./nSo why all of the trouble and headaches just to see this one artist on tour?/nI joined Lori, Andrea, Tiffany and Emma on their ride to see Swift in Inglewood on Aug. 3 to find out that it wasn\u2019t just about the music, there was much more to it./n\u201cI just love what a phenomenal role model Taylor is for my kid,\u201d Andrea said as we cruised down the 91 Freeway on the way to the show. \u201cWhen \u2018Reputation\u2019 came out, Emma started having a stronger voice. It\u2019s like \u2018Reputation\u2019 released Emma. Not to mention Taylor is just kind, generous and a great businesswoman.\u201d/nEmma and Tiffany have known each other since about the age of three and grew up dancing competitively \u2014 even one year dressing up as Swifties with blonde bob wigs and dancing to Swift\u2019s music./n\u201cAw, we are each other\u2019s longest friend,\u201d Emma realizes as the two, who are cozied in the back of the vehicle adjusting their \u201cFolklore\u201d and \u201cMidnights\u201d themed outfits and pondering aloud which secret songs Swift will play later that evening. (Spoiler alert: It was \u201cMaroon\u201d and \u201cI Can See You (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d.)/n\u201cI have a bracelet that says \u2018I heart Mama Swift\u2019 and I just think Taylor\u2019s mom has to be such a great person to have raised such a great daughter,\u201d Andrea said, referring to Swift\u2019s mother, also named Andrea, who has become a rock star herself at her daughter\u2019s shows, as she walks the venues to meet fans./n\u201cI mean, the two of us are raising daughters, too, and it\u2019s not easy,\u201d she added./nI asked the young women why they liked Swift\u2019s music and was met with a loud \u201cPffttt\u201d and a laugh from Emma, the kind of response only a teenager could deliver without uttering, \u201cDuh! My mom\u2019s friend\u201d at me./n\u201cThere are too many things, I can\u2019t even name,\u201d Tiffany offered./nAnd I very much believe she feels that way./nFor their mothers, it has become something special that they can share with their daughters./n\u201cIt\u2019s something that Tiffany and I can bond over,\u201d Lori said. \u201cShe has her music and I have mine, but this is our music. I also love that Taylor is so great with her fans and the music just makes me feel good.\u201d/nFor Andrea, this is her final summer at home with Emma for now, who is heading to Indiana State University next year. As luck would have it, the day we were headed to Inglewood, Swift announced additional dates for The Eras Tour in 2024. And she\u2019s hitting Indianapolis, not far from Emma\u2019s new college, in November./n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to get tickets,\u201d Andrea assures. \u201cI just like that I have this time with Emma. I get to experience this with her.\u201d/nLori is the first to admit she\u2019s gone a little overboard this year with The Eras Tour, especially with her outfits. Since she\u2019s going to four shows in Inglewood, she has a different outfit for each evening, all inspired by Swift\u2019s costuming in her music videos or on previous tours. She did give my friends and me a fashion show the week before of each outfit, stuff she purchased off of Poshmark and Etsy and went to work bedazzling and glittering herself to make the looks just right. She did this for herself as well as for Tiffany and she laugh-cringes when she shares the outfits for four Southern California dates and the early stop in Nashville cost over a grand. She and Tiffany also made dozens of Swiftie friendship bracelets, each one with a Swift saying and song titles or lyrics, dates and more that meant something to them./nAnd because they\u2019re both cat ladies, just like Swift, Lori made tiny little friendship bracelets for cats to give fellow cat-loving Swifties./n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how much those little beads cost,\u201d she said with a laugh./nSome may think it\u2019s insane to indulge so much in a silly little concert, but as these women put the final touches on their outfits and drew on glittery 13s on the backs of their hands (Swift\u2019s favorite number), I watched them laugh, smile, hug and at time squeal in delight as they met other Swifties on the way up to the Stadium./nIt was almost like a scene from the new \u201cBarbie\u201d movie \u2014 instead of the normal \u201cHi, Barbie!\u201d greeting inside Barbieland, it was \u201cHi, Swiftie\u201d in Taylorland. They took pictures, traded bracelets with other fans and danced to the Swift songs that were being played outside the venue in anticipation for the big event./nThey scream-cried-sang and danced through the entire show and took lots of pictures and videos to post on social media. And, of course, they picked up more merch./n\u201cIt\u2019s totally worth it,\u201d Lori said of their Eras Tour experience."

[+] of Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on July 08, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri. (Photo by Fernando Leon/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nOn October 13, Taylor Swift will release her highly-anticipated concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The movie is built around her Los Angeles stops on her historic trek, which has now taken her to Mexico and will continue around the globe for the next year or so. The movie is on track to be a box office smash, but those future ticket numbers only tell part of the story when it comes to how much money Swift will make from the project./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is already pacing for a massive debut at the box office, with some industry projections placing its first weekend\u2019s figure at $100 million or more. Remember, that number only reflects the first few days the movie is out in the world. The title could run for a few weekends, or perhaps months, and by the time all is said and done and it leaves theaters, there\u2019s no telling how many more millions it might bring in./nIt\u2019s also not entirely clear how much Swift is set to earn from Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. She and her team clearly led the charge of creating, filming and selling the title to a distributor, as they didn\u2019t go through more traditional channels. How her deal was structured was never made public, but the star of the show is surely going to earn millions from the theatrical run./nOnce Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is done playing in theaters, it will find its way to the digital world, though what exactly that second life will look like in is unclear. According to a report published by Puck, the streaming rights to the movie have yet to be acquired, but many of the top platforms are likely making offers to the singer, clamoring to get an exclusive on what is about to become the most successful concert movie ever./nSwift has a history of selling her documentaries and concert films to streaming platforms. She\u2019s worked with a number in the past, with some of her movies appearing on Netflix\nNFLX\n, Apple\nAAPL\n and Disney+. The singer has also recently been synching some of her new songs in Amazon Prime Video shows, so that company is probably competing for this movie as well./nSwift apparently doesn\u2019t have a preference when it comes to working with the major streamers, and she is surely accepting propositions from many of the entertainment giants./nWhat Swift has been paid for any of her past films has never been made public, but each project likely earned her millions. Fellow pop stars like Billie Eilish and Rihanna have reportedly earned more than $20 million for their docs, and Swift is even more popular, so it\u2019s safe to guess that her payday for each of her docs was close to that sum./nAfter Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour wraps its historic box office run, there will be a clamoring among fans to know when they can see it again. This movie is the rare sort that may be big enough to convince some to sign up for a streaming platform they don\u2019t already pay for, and that makes it incredibly valuable to any of them. The mere association with Swift is also worth paying handsomely for as well./nAfter earning millions of dollars in traditional movie theaters, Swift could earn millions more, if not tens of millions, when she sells the rights to Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. She might forgo such a plan, instead selling the film digitally and on DVD, but going with a streaming site will likely be easier and a clean, simple paycheck./nWhich company will win out, and when it might hit streaming platforms, is yet to be announced, but the deal will only add to the hundreds of millions Swift is set to take home from the tour itself, with this movie being another way she can become much richer thanks to this effort./n"

    "content": "In case you haven\u2019t heard, football fans are in their Swiftie era, and pop music fans are in their Travis Kelce era amid widespread rumors that the \u201cSpeak Now\u201d artist and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end are an item./nMemes, TikTok videos, Instagram reels and timelines dissecting every inch of the celebrities\u2019 rumored love story \u2014 from a viral photo of Swift wrapping her arm around Kelce\u2019s neck (gasp!) to the musician\u2019s choice of sauces (ketchup and \u201cseemingly ranch\u201d) while eating chicken fingers at Sunday\u2019s Chiefs game \u2014 have dominated the news and social media./nAnd with Swift reportedly planning to make an encore appearance this weekend at the Jets vs. Chiefs game in New Jersey, there\u2019s no telling what fresh Traylor content (Tayvis content?) awaits us. That\u2019s why we, an entertainment reporter and a sports reporter, have gotten together to analyze this game of love. (Sigh, look what you made us do.)/nBut before we unpack some recent events that have unfolded in the Tayvis universe, let\u2019s review some history./n Entertainment & Arts /nSince Swift was spotted watching Travis Kelce at Sunday\u2019s Chiefs game, many have wondered what it means for the NFL. But what about Kansas City?/nSept. 28, 2023/nIt all started in July, when Kelce lamented on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast that he wasn\u2019t able to meet Swift while attending one of her Eras tour concerts at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. \u201cI was a little bit hurt I didn\u2019t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,\u201d he said at the time./nSince then, cheeky remarks from Kelce\u2019s older brother Jason and his Chiefs teammates (\u201cPlease, everybody, stop asking my brother about ... my love life,\u201d the younger Kelce jokingly pleaded last week) have fueled the fantasy that the \u201cLavender Haze\u201d hitmaker and the two-time Super Bowl champion will end up together./nThat fantasy came one step closer to reality on Sunday when Swift accepted Kelce\u2019s invitation to watch him play at the same Arrowhead Stadium she recently rocked. The Grammy winner was spotted cheering enthusiastically for the home team alongside  the jock\u2019s mother, Donna Kelce./n\u201cShout out to Taylor for pulling up, that was pretty ballsy,\u201d Travis Kelce said Wednesday on his podcast. \u201cIt was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her.\u201d/n\u201cShe looked amazing,\u201d he added. \u201cEverybody was talking about her in a great light and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course.\u201d/nNow let\u2019s kick off that discussion. /n Entertainment & Arts /nKansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce opens up about Taylor Swift watching him play Sunday. \u2018It was definitely a game I\u2019ll remember,\u2019 he said./nSept. 27, 2023/nChristi Carras, entertainment reporter: So, Chuck, how does it feel to see Taylor Swift putting Travis Kelce on the map?/nChuck Schilken, sports reporter: Christi, I think you need to calm down (hahahaha! just wanted to get my favorite Taylor Swift song title in here right off the bat). But yeah, I actually have some thoughts on this apparent trend of football fans being triggered by that question./nCarras: LOL. Shake it off, Chuck! But also, say more. (We are of course referring to the TikTok trend in which women ask the male football fans in their life about Taylor Swift putting Travis Kelce \u201con the map,\u201d causing their gullible targets to lose their minds.)/nSchilken: While the phrase \u201con the map\u201d is kind of vague, overall it\u2019s actually a pretty accurate statement. All football fans know who Travis Kelce is \u2014 two-time Super Bowl champion, three Super Bowl appearances, eight Pro Bowls, already considered a future Hall of Famer. And while he\u2019s definitely known by some in wider circles (hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d had his own dating show, apparently has his autograph tattooed somewhere on Post Malone), Kelce wasn\u2019t close to being a household name before this. /n Sports /nPop star Post Malone challenged the Chiefs\u2019 Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce to beer pong and ended up with their autographs tattooed on his body./nJuly 14, 2020/nSo any football fan who flies off the handle at a non- or casual football fan suggesting Swift put Kelce \u201con the map\u201d is basically behaving in the same way many people accuse Swifties of behaving whenever a slight toward their \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d is perceived. Swift has absolutely elevated Kelce several stratospheres in terms of mainstream recognition./nCarras: To your point, I have to admit that as a non-football fan I did not know who Travis Kelce was until this month. You also bring up an interesting comparison between Swifties and football stans. Many would argue \u2014 and have argued \u2014 that pop music enthusiasts (particularly young women and girls) are often judged harshly for obsessing over their idols, while sports fans don\u2019t receive the same level of scrutiny for obsessing over their favorite teams or players. So it\u2019s fascinating to see how this unexpected crossover has seemingly bridged those two worlds. /nThough I will say that I\u2019m sure there were already tons of people in the middle of the Taylor Swift/football fan Venn diagram before this whole thing even started. What do you make of this moment that appears to have taken over every corner of the internet, from Swiftie circles to the NFL\u2019s official TikTok?/nSchilken: I am honestly kind of surprised at how much the NFL and its fans are embracing this. Sports fans are notorious for worrying that any positive development in players\u2019 lives will become a dreaded \u201cdistraction.\u201d But on Sunday everyone seemed to enjoy the circus, with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and coach Andy Reid making jokes about it to reporters. (Even New England Patriots coach/super-grouch Bill Belichick chimed in from a distance). /n Music /nCultural dominance. History-making album sales. Sold-out stadiums. Add them up, and Taylor Swift\u2019s current moment has little precedent in pop-music history./nAug. 1, 2023/nBUT! I can only imagine a completely different scenario if Kelce had a bad game or if the Chiefs, a team with Super Bowl aspirations again this season, had lost or struggled against a horrible Chicago Bears team \u2014 it would be like a flashback to the \u201cJessica  Jinx\u201d or \u201cCarrie  Curse\u201d labels given to Tony Romo\u2019s high-profile romances with Jessica Simpson and Carrie Underwood during his playing days with the Dallas Cowboys./nCarras: Ouch! Hoping for Swift\u2019s sake that society has evolved past that misogynistic nonsense. I too have been overwhelmed by the amount of pro-Travis Kelce content I\u2019ve been seeing on my feed \u2014 from fancams of him dancing in the end zone, to the tune of Swift\u2019s \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d to slow-motion videos of him allegedly gazing lovingly at Swift in the stands. /nEven the NFL got in on the fun with a hilarious TikTok breaking down the romance rumors and incorporating some pretty clever Swift puns. I feel like I\u2019m getting Travis Kelce-pilled and, honestly, I\u2019m not mad about it? I went back and watched a bunch of clips from his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d episode \u2014 he has a winning smile and great comedic timing! And I hear he\u2019s pretty good at sports too. So I can see the appeal./nSchilken: Well for me I guess it\u2019s a little different. I did know who Taylor Swift was long before this (as did every other football fan \u2014 they are lying if they tell you otherwise). The only songs I know are from the radio and there are a few I really like. But I was also suffering from a bit of Taylor fatigue after this everything-Eras summer. And to be honest, I was even starting to get tired of Travis Kelce, as he and his brother Jason (the Philadelphia Eagles center) and their parents seemed to be the subject of every feature story going into this year\u2019s Super Bowl (which, yes, was dubbed the Kelce Bowl by many) and Travis\u2019 profile had continued to rise all offseason, even before all this. /n Sports /nTravis and Jason Kelce are on opposing sides for the Chiefs and Eagles in the 2023 Super Bowl, and their father understands their competitive nature./nFeb. 3, 2023/nBoth Kelce brothers are very outgoing and have great personalities and without a doubt have their sights set on being the next Manning brothers when their playing careers are over. So I\u2019m sure Travis is glad Swifties approve of him. But I will admit to being a little more than slightly annoyed this week when my feed is full of nothing but Taylor-Travis \u201cnews\u201d when I just want to read about football./nCarras: That\u2019s funny \u2014 this is the first time I\u2019m hearing the term \u201cKelce Bowl.\u201d Most people in my orbit referred to this year\u2019s Super Bowl as \u201cthe Rihanna concert\u201d (and what a concert it was!). But I can definitely understand the fatigue. I guess most of the countless headlines I\u2019ve seen have focused on their rumored relationship. So I\u2019m sorry but I have to ask, in your professional sports-journalist opinion, do you think Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are actually dating?/nSchilken: YES!!!! I mean, if they\u2019re just a couple of buddies trying to punk everyone for a few laughs, they\u2019ve really put way too much effort into it at this point. Plus, some of Travis\u2019 comments in his podcast with his brother Jason on Wednesday \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s real is that it is my personal life and I want to respect both of our lives\u201d \u2014 really sound like he\u2019s talking about something more than just a casual friendship. /nWhat do you think?/nCarras: I am dying at the level of enthusiasm behind that response. You make some good points \u2014 the \u201cpersonal life\u201d comment definitely made my ears perk up too. But I have to say I am a little skeptical. ... I think there\u2019s a decent chance that this Super Bowl champion invited his pop star crush to come watch him play from his VIP suite, and Swift just figured, why not? Sounds like fun. He\u2019s team captain, and she\u2019s on the bleachers. But who knows? Maybe there is something more to it than that./n Music /nThe film was shot during Swift\u2019s record-breaking six-night stand at SoFi Stadium and will open in theaters on Oct. 13./nAug. 31, 2023/nI will say that Kelce would be a bit of a departure from her recent dating habits \u2014 and not just because he\u2019s a pro athlete. She recently got out of a long, relatively low-key relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, who kept details of their romance pretty private. So the fact that Kelce is constantly getting asked about her on his podcast and in  interviews \u2014 not to mention the NFL milking this moment for all it\u2019s worth and capitalizing on her stardom \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of variables for someone as visible as Swift to weigh when considering whether to pursue a relationship with someone in the public eye. /nI personally like the idea of them just being two buds supporting each other\u2019s work, but I know a lot of people suspect it\u2019s all just a big PR stunt. What are your thoughts on that theory?/nSchilken: Well if it\u2019s a PR stunt, the only one I can see really getting anything out of it is Kelce, just because it has raised his profile in a way that will make him super marketable now and much more recognizable when he\u2019s  pursuing his post-NFL projects. I don\u2019t really think the NFL is necessarily milking it \u2014 they seem to be doing all right for themselves and I think are just having fun with all this. /nAnd if it is a PR stunt, then I guess it\u2019s like you said and Taylor is just having fun, because I really can\u2019t think of any other way she benefits from this. But I also know she is very good to her fans and can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d lead them on about something this important. That would be cruel \u2014 and it\u2019s not even summer anymore./nCarras: OK, OK. I know the NFL isn\u2019t exactly a small local business in need of extra support, but the league is definitely benefiting from all this attention, and it knows it. My colleague Alexandra Del Rosario reported this week that Kansas City ticket sales and Travis Kelce jersey sales have increased significantly amid all the Traylor (Tayvis?) excitement, and much of the buzz I\u2019ve seen about Swift attending Sunday\u2019s game has been filtered through official NFL channels. Heck, a prominent NFL announcer made a \u201cBlank Space\u201d joke before Swift was even spotted at one of Kelce\u2019s games./n Music /nTaylor Swift cheered on her rumored beau, Travis Kelce, alongside his mom, Donna Kelce, at the Chiefs game in Kansas City on Sunday./nSept. 24, 2023/nBut I digress (steps down from soap box). I agree that Swift doesn\u2019t really have much to gain from this from a publicity standpoint \u2014 but I\u2019m sure her team will nonetheless enjoy any bump in preorders for her upcoming album, \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d and box-office revenue for her Eras tour concert movie, both debuting next month. /nI actually did put out a request to a music data analytics firm because I\u2019m curious whether Swift\u2019s streaming numbers have noticeably spiked in recent weeks. While we await the official results, it\u2019s kind of fun to guess which Swift tracks have been streamed the most in this moment. What do you think the standouts will be?/nSchilken: Hmmm. I would think Chiefs fans who are not super familiar with Swift\u2019s catalog might be scanning the list to see if there\u2019s anything that might provide some insight into what their beloved tight end might be experiencing at this moment of (alleged) blossoming romance. /nSince Taylor does have a song simply called \u201cLove Story\u201d (in multiple versions, no less), that might be a good place to start, maybe followed by \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d and \u201cLover.\u201d And then, the Kansas City fans might look for some breakup songs (\u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d and \u201cWe Are Never, Ever Getting Back Together\u201d seem like obvious choices) just to see how that might go for their guy if the (alleged) relationship doesn\u2019t work out./nBut I know you have a much greater knowledge of her music than I do. What do you think the top picks might be and do you have any recommendations for curious Chiefs fans who might not be all that familiar with her work?/n Sports /nBianka Bryant, daughter of Kobe and Vanessa, gets \u201822\u2019 hat from Taylor Swift as Eras tour stops at SoFi Stadium for six nights. The Bryants are famously Swifties./nAug. 4, 2023/nCarras: All great picks! I have seen \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d referenced a lot recently (Swift falls in love with a football player in the music video for the latter), so I think you\u2019re probably right on target there. A slightly deeper cut from her early career, the sentimental ballad \u201cFifteen,\u201d has also gained some traction because of the lyric \u201cIn your life you\u2019ll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team.\u201d /nAnd of course, \u201cCruel Summer\u201d \u2014 one of the opening numbers from her sold-out Eras tour \u2014 has been having somewhat of a renaissance and has been the soundtrack of many a Travis Kelce TikTok floating around the internet. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that one got a streaming boost as well./nAs far as recommendations go,  her catalog is full of so many bops that it\u2019s hard to choose. However, the thought of a whole stadium of Kansas City fans belting the lyrics to the 10-minute version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d (a la Robyn\u2019s \u201cDancing on My Own\u201d becoming the unexpected anthem of the Boston Red Sox) and exchanging friendship bracelets is so entertaining that I\u2019m inclined to leverage this opportunity to manifest it. Perhaps my wildest dreams will come true at this Sunday\u2019s game \u2014 isn\u2019t Swift rumored to be planning to attend?/nSchilken: Yes, she is. But it\u2019s a road game for the Chiefs, so Swift\u2019s love story (sorry, I\u2019m at the point in my Taylor knowledge where I need to start recycling song titles) with home fans in Kansas City will have to be put on hold. That\u2019s not to say, of course, that New York Jets fans and the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d camera operators aren\u2019t going to be thrilled to have the pop icon in their presence at MetLife Stadium. And maybe NBC will have better luck than Fox, which reportedly tried and failed to get Swift\u2019s permission to use her music during the Chiefs-Bears game./nCarras: Well, I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m feeling 22 \u2014 er, I mean I\u2019m certainly planning on tuning in to find out./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nIn just under one month, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour will hit theaters across North America. The film, which will showcase Swift's massively successful The Eras Tour, is expected to be a box office smash. In fact, predictions already place its opening weekend pull at $100 million or more. All that money will surely make Swift happy, but that might not be the end of the rewards coming to her for the movie./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour may one earn the star of the picture the Best Music Film Grammy. The superstar has already won a dozen Grammys, but she's never competed in this specific field, and her latest movie may change that... though she'll have to wait a while before earning that nomination./nBest Music Film was introduced in the '80s by the Recording Academy to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.\" In the past, the prize has gone to a mix of concert films and documentaries about music and musicians, and Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour should be considered a frontrunner... when it's actually eligible./nTo be eligible for consideration in the Best Music Film category, any concert and/or performance films or music documentaries must be released in theaters, be put up for sale to the general public, or air on TV (or in today's world, streaming platforms) within the eligibility window, or some combination of those. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is hitting theaters across America, so that immediately makes it eligible, though fans shouldn't expect it to count among Swift's upcoming nominations./nThe cutoff date for the 2024 Grammys was September 15, 2023, so that means that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour won't be able to compete at the upcoming ceremony. Instead, it will be eligible a year later, when it will likely be a serious contender for the Best Music Film award. By then, the movie may have also made its way to streaming platforms, though Swift and her team have remained mum on that subject./nSwift is expected to be one of the top nominees at the 2024 Grammys, even if she can't go out for Best Music Film. She has several albums and many singles that are eligible for consideration, and she's likely to dominate not only the top categories but also the pop and perhaps country fields as well. The singer-songwriter may walk away with some of the biggest honors, including Album, Record and Song of the Year./n"

AFP PHOTO/  ROBYN BECK (Photo by ROBYN BECK / AFP) (Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)/nFor several months now, Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cCruel Summer\u201d has ranked as one of the biggest songs in America. The tune quickly broke into the top 10 on the Hot 100 after it was officially released as a single, but it hasn\u2019t quite worked its way to the peak position. With a slew of new releases vying for attention and more major drops coming soon, can Swift compete and send her electro tune to the No. 1 spot?/nThis week, \u201cCruel Summer\u201d ranks at No. 5 on the Hot 100, earning another turn inside the top 10. The track has thus far climbed as high as No. 3. Now, it\u2019s dipped in its standing from the period prior, and both Swift and her legion of followers may have to settle for it being a top 10 win and not a No. 1, as it looks like claiming the throne is a dream that increasingly seems less and less likely to happen./nFor the past several weeks, splashy No. 1 debuts have kept \u201cCruel Summer\u201d from ruling. First, country newcomer Oliver Anthony started his breakout smash \u201cRich Men North of Richmond\u201d atop the Hot 100 in a surprise move. The cut went viral almost immediately after being released, and it earned a pair of frames in charge of the ranking./nThen, when it seemed like \u201cCruel Summer\u201d might have a shot at climbing to a new peak position on the Hot 100, it was beaten again by another new leader. Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves earn their first No. 1 on the chart this frame, with \u201cI Remember Everything.\u201d That cut also starts in first place at the same time Bryan\u2019s self-titled album rules the Billboard 200./nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that other tracks appeared ahead of \u201cCruel Summer\u201d in both of these instances, but the attention paid to both Anthony and Bryan and Musgraves\u2019s hits did not help Swift\u2019s cause to claim another No. 1 on the Hot 100./nNext week, it looks like Doja Cat will dominate the Hot 100 with her single \u201cPaint the Town Red.\u201d This turn, the cut rises from No. 5 to No. 3 in just its fourth frame on the chart. As the release date for her new album Scarlet nears, fans are supporting the rapper and singer in droves, and she may be on her way to another leader very soon./nFollowing Cat\u2019s likely ruling, there are a handful of albums that could produce new No. 1s on the Hot 100, or at least top 10s whose debuts might result in \u201cCruel Summer\u201d falling again. Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s album Guts is out now, and it will likely make a huge impact on the Hot 100 next week, perhaps even sending several cuts into the highest tier on the chart./nLater this month, both Cat and Drake have full-lengths set to drop, and of the two, the latter star could easily claim another No. 1 hit, as he often does when he has a full collection to share. His album For All The Dogs has already produced a No. 2-peaking single with \u201cSearch & Rescue,\u201d and there\u2019s no telling what he has coming soon./nAt this point, it still remains entirely possible that \u201cCruel Summer\u201d will find its way to the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100, though its chances may be dwindling. If the song was sitting at No. 2, it might have a better shot at the penthouse, but the fact that it\u2019s slowly working its way down the chart isn\u2019t a good sign for its future./n\u201cCruel Summer\u201d is finding it difficult to compete with new releases from superstar and viral entrants that can\u2019t be beaten. If Swift pulls out all the stops and gives the world more reasons to stream and buy the cut, it might have a shot, but there\u2019s a real chance it won\u2019t ever make it to No. 1./n"

    "content": "WWTD?/nThat\u2019s \u201cWhat will Taylor do?\u201d and it\u2019s the only question that matters in Los Angeles this week. /nShould Taylor Swift cancel her six sold-out shows at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood to support striking hotel workers? Or blow off labor solidarity in favor of fans who have in some cases traveled thousands of miles and spent thousands of hard-earned dollars to see their idol?/nThe mere thought of a postponement stokes terror in the hearts of parents whose teenagers would melt down faster than ice in the desert if their coveted tickets were suddenly just bar-coded promises of future fun./nBut this week, more than four dozen state and local politicians, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, who is running to be our next governor, sent an open letter to Taylor asking her to \u201cstand with hotel workers\u201d and postpone her L.A. dates. /nIt\u2019s an ask that Swift can\u2019t just shake off, because hot labor summer has been as fiery as her Eras tour, which may end up being the highest-grossing concert tour in history. Across the country, workers are unionizing and striking, fed up with income inequality and lives of scraping by \u2014 as they should be. No one should work full time and still be forced to live in their car, or even on the streets. No one should end the month at a food bank because their paychecks don\u2019t feed their families. /n Entertainment & Arts /nNot a lover of $100 parking spaces? There are plenty of ways to get to Taylor Swift\u2019s concerts at SoFi Stadium by train or bus./nJuly 31, 2023/nSince July 20, the housekeepers, cooks, front desk clerks and other workers of Unite Here Local 11 have been striking against about 60 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Like their striking union sisters and brothers at SAG-AFTRA, they want wages and benefits that keep up with the cost of living. And like their striking siblings, they\u2019ve had little luck convincing bosses to make progress at the bargaining table. /nIt\u2019s easy to see this letter to Swift as nothing more than a political ploy to grab headlines, and in one way it is. Here we are talking about it. /nBut it\u2019s also smart strategy. Strikes are about pressure, economic and social, and the juggernaut of these Swift concerts is unprecedented, even by L.A. standards. /nMedia reports said the dancing and sound from her Seattle show set off the equivalent of a magnitude 2.3 earthquake. And according to some estimates, the tour could generate nearly $4.6 billion in consumer spending in the United States alone, with Swift pulling in $13 million a night just for herself. /nWith that kind of force, Swift has the power to change the course of the strike, even without canceling a show. /nIf the striking workers can get her attention, and her sympathy, imagine the power of Swift visiting a picket line for a photo op, or bringing strikers up on stage with her? That\u2019s hundreds of millions of fans who suddenly have no doubt the strikers are in the right. /n\u201cWhen you sit on the sideline and say nothing, I think that\u2019s the worst thing you can possibly do,\u201d Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer (D-Los Angeles) told me Wednesday. He\u2019s one of the politicians who signed the letter, and a longtime member of Service Employees International Union 721. /n\u201cEveryone needs to take to the streets and say we need to do the right thing,\u201d he said. /nEven Swift./nWhich is why they asked, and why they think she\u2019ll answer. /nIn her early years, Swift was staunchly apolitical, fearful, she has said, of Dixie Chicks-style blowback if she stepped out of line in her country music world. /nBut her world has grown and so has she, and in more recent times she\u2019s become an outspoken powerhouse who can sway public opinion with a single word to her hundreds of millions of fans. /nIn 2020, she took on Donald Trump during the unrest after the murder of George Floyd. Trump tweeted about wanting to send military troops into Minneapolis. /nSwift shot back via Twitter, where she has 93 million followers. /n\u201cAfter stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? \u2018When the looting starts the shooting starts\u2019??? We will vote you out in November,\u201d she wrote. /nMore recently during her Chicago concert, she spoke out against the wave of anti-LGBTQ+ laws that have been passed across the nation./n\u201cRight now and in recent years, there have been so many harmful pieces of legislation that have put people in the LGBTQ and queer community at risk. It\u2019s painful for everyone. Every ally, every loved one, every person in these communities,\u201d Swift reportedly told the crowd. /n Entertainment & Arts /nParking! Public transit! Fan chants! Friendship bracelets! Everything you need to know before you see Taylor Swift at SoFi Stadium for the L.A. stops of her Eras tour./nAug. 4, 2023/nSwift isn\u2019t blind to the struggles of the working class, either. Just this week, she reportedly gave $55 million in bonuses to nearly everyone toiling on her tour \u2014 including a reported $100,000 to each of the truck drivers hauling her gear from town to town. /nThe owner of one of those trucking companies called it a \u201clife-changing sum of money\u201d for the men and women who have spent the last 24 weeks on the road with Swift, and of course, it is. And it doesn\u2019t hurt the cash came with a handwritten note from the megastar to each of those workers. /nAnd let\u2019s not forget she\u2019s fought the man on her own behalf. For the past few years, Swift has been rerecording her old albums because she doesn\u2019t own the masters to those songs. She signed a bad contract when she was a teenager, giving ownership of them to the label./nLater, the rights to those recordings were purchased by music manager Scooter Braun, with whom Swift has had an epic feud to regain control of her music. Her victory came with deciding to rerecord her early works, giving her complete ownership of the new material and him the proverbial middle finger. So you know she\u2019s a brawler, and believes in fair compensation, even if it requires a fight. /nSo fear not, Swifties.

    "content": "GLENDALE, ARIZONA - MARCH 17: Editorial use only and no commercial use at any time. No use on ... [+] publication covers is permitted after August 9, 2023. Taylor Swift performs onstage for the opening night of \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at State Farm Stadium on March 17, 2023 in Glendale, Arizona. The city of Glendale, Arizona was ceremonially renamed to Swift City for March 17-18 in honor of The Eras Tour. (Photo by John Medina/Getty Images)/nThe first leg of Taylor Swift's highly anticipated The Eras Tour came to a thrilling close as the superstar took to the stage this past week, not just to perform her chart-topping hits, but to make a monumental announcement. Amidst the roar of the crowd, Swift confirmed what fans had eagerly anticipated: her iconic album 1989 will soon be reborn as 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)./nThis re-recording and re-release project, the latest in a series from the singer-songwriter, immediately became a trending topic all around the world. With a late October street date looming, there are plenty of signs that point to 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) potentially becoming Swift's most monumental re-release yet./n1989 already holds a special place in Swift\u2019s discographies as one of her most significant albums. In terms of units moved, the title ranks second in her catalog, boasting an impressive nine million equivalent units in the U.S. While Fearless has achieved the coveted milestone of 10-times platinum, commonly referred to as diamond status, 1989 holds its own unique claim to fame./nThe set marked Swift's transformation from country favorite into a veritable pop sensation, a genre she has dominated ever since. The album's irresistibly catchy melodies and chart-topping singles solidified its status as an indelible pop culture cornerstone, and fans can\u2019t wait to hear it again./nAt the heart of 1989\u2019s success lies a trio of smash singles that all reached No. 1 on the Hot 100. Swift's infectious hits, \"Shake It Off,\" \"Blank Space\" and the collaboration \"Bad Blood\" with Kendrick Lamar, dominated the airwaves and left their mark in music history. Additional singles like \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Style\" also reached echelons of the top 10./n1989 secured five top 10 hits back when doing so meant more than it does today. Now, many artists debut tracks inside the region, only to see them disappear. This phenomenon wasn\u2019t frequently seen nearly a decade ago. It is worth noting that while Swift's album Midnights boasts the most top 10 hits of any album in history (10 at one time, no less), many of these entries had fleeting stays in the upper ranks of the charts\u2014a contrast to the remaining popularity of 1989./nThe anticipation surrounding the re-recording of 1989 is warranted given the album's extraordinary string of hits. The enduring allure of these favorites is evident in their continuous streaming and radio play. 1989 sounds like a compilation of Swift's greatest hits, it\u2019s so packed with winners. With Swift breathing new life into these beloved tracks through reimagined versions, it is only logical to anticipate that 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) will become a monumental success, potentially outshining its predecessors./nSwift's re-recordings project has thus far proven to be an unmitigated triumph. Each re-released album, including Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version), Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) and Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), have all confidently seized the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart. These releases have exhibited a pattern of continuous growth, with each subsequent debut amassing larger and larger streaming and sales figures./nWith Swift's confirmation that 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) is coming in a few months, and the idea that not only will she reinvigorate some of the biggest singles of this generation, but also deliver previously unheard tracks as well, anticipation is at an all-time high. As the release date approaches, the set\u2019s debut promises to be huge, potentially cementing 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) as the crowning jewel in Swift's re-recording endeavor\u2014a fitting homage to the album that propelled her into the stratosphere of pop music./n"

    "content": "Attention '90s kids: The new Netflix thriller Reptile features a very important Excess Baggage\u00a0reunion that reteams Benicio del Toro and Alicia Silverstone for the very first time since that 1997 Blockbuster staple. And for that reason alone, you've got to \u2014 in the words of another song from that late-'90s era \u2014 praise first-time feature filmmaker Grant Singer like you should. But the music video director-turned-narrative filmmaker tells Yahoo Entertainment that he can't take all the credit for bringing Del Toro and Silverstone back together as, respectively, small-town detective Tom Nichols and his wife, Judy./n\"Benicio and I were talking about who could play Judy, and he mentioned Alicia,\" recalls Singer, who was 17 when Excess Baggage drove into theaters. \"Having worked with her and known her for so long, he was aware she could inhabit the role in a really interesting way. Alicia brings such a vulnerability and strength to that relationship \u2014 she's really the emotional anchor of the film.\"/nMeanwhile, Del Toro brings the heat... and we mean that in the Michael Mann sense. Tom is a former Philadelphia cop who left his previous job after an investigation into his corrupt partner. Freshly relocated to New England, he gets tangled in another web of deceit that originates with the murder of a local real estate agent \u2014 potentially by her partner, played by Justin Timberlake \u2014 and stretches back into Tom's new department. Eventually, the world-weary cop who just wants to stay neutral has to pick a side, even if it means upending the quiet life he promised Judy./n\"We wanted to evoke the feeling of being deceived, and play with this idea of the hunter being the hunted,\" Singer says of the inspiration for Reptile, which he co-wrote with Benjamin Brewer and Del Toro. Additional inspiration was provided by films like Serpico and The Conversation, not to mention the work of another one-time music video auteur, David Fincher, whom Singer calls \"one of my favorite living directors.\"/n\"But I'll be honest \u2014 I was just trying to do me,\" he adds. \"This is my first film, so I was approaching it as: 'What do I want to do? What is my style?' I think it's ultimately about this balance between formalism, where things are very graphic and composed, but also the feeling that you're within a scene and the camera becomes invisible.\"/nReptile arrives on Netflix after premiering at the recently concluded Toronto International Film Festival, which Singer attended without his cast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike. But Timberlake made some noise just as the festival was winding down, announcing his own long-awaited reunion with the NSync crew, which released their first album the same year that Del Toro and Silverstone loaded up their car with Excess Baggage. And Singer says he'll happily helm any music videos that the boy band might decide to do in the future./n\"If they hit me up, I'd love to do it,\" Singer enthuses. \"I'm so grateful to have collaborated with Justin on Reptile. You can tell once you meet him why he's one of the world's greatest entertainers. He responded to my vision for the movie, and brought a lot of his own ideas. And that's all you can ask for as a director.\"/n(Coincidentally, NSync dropped its new single, \"Better Place,\" on Friday \u2014 listen here.)/nWhile he hasn't directed an NSync video (at least, not yet), we spoke with Singer about some of his past collaborations with such major artists as The Weeknd and Taylor Swift, and why he has no plans to retire from the music video game, even if Reptile becomes Netflix's next viral sensation./nSinger's first major music video collab was with Sky Ferreira, who parlayed early MySpace fame into a successful singing and acting career. The duo made six videos within the span of a single year, including \"Lost in My Bedroom\" off of her EP Ghost. The evocative three-minute piece plays like a long lost found footage clip from the late '90s, when The Blair Witch Project was all the rage./n\"Sky and I had been roommates in L.A. and we talked about making a lot of videos for that album cycle,\" Singer recalls now. \"'Lost in My Bedroom' was shot at another friend's house with no budget. I took a VHS camcorder and over there, and we shot a bunch of stuff in the middle of the night. And then I used this really cool technique of where we processed the footage through a TV screen and looped it back. It had this very surreal feel./n\"That era of making music videos was very much about making stuff with friends and having fun,\" Singer continues. \"We were making things for the sake of making them. Looking back, those were some of the happiest times of my life because it was coming from such an innocent place.\"/nThe year after his Fierra series exploded in a big way, Singer directed an explosive trilogy of videos based on three songs featured on The Weeknd's blockbuster sophomore studio album, Beauty Behind the Madness. And if you notice certain recurring scenes and characters \u2014 specifically Rick Wilder as a devilish figure \u2014 in all three, that's definitely by design./n\"Story is too strong a word, but there were linked themes and ideas we were playing with in those videos,\" Singer says of how he and The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, conceptualized the series. \"Things like the idea of the self and the idea of the devil. We wanted to let the imagery and feeling speak for themselves. Abel and I have a very similar taste in films, and we were always talking about movies during those videos. We made them within five months of each other \u2014 it was like bam bam bam.\"/nAnd, for the record, Singer says that he was a fan of Tesfaye's controversial HBO series The Idol, which was canceled after one wild season. \"I was so happy for him,\" the director says. \"I love to see him act, because he's a phenomenal actor and a great person, so I'm glad to see that he made a TV show.\"/nNobody puts Lil Wayne in a corner. When the rapper appeared alongside Ariana Grande in the video for their Dangerous Woman track, he mostly directed himself. That was certainly the case for the final scene of the video where Wayne blows a puff of smoke in Grande's face mid-lyric and she starts cracking up./n\"That was a spontaneous moment,\" Singer confirms with a laugh. \"When Lil Wayne comes on set, you just let him do his thing! Then you get out of the way, film it and call it a day.\"/nEven when he's working with two major recording artists at the heights of their careers, Singer says that he approaches the task of directing the same way. \"For me, it's always about having conversations where we articulate our ideas,\" he explains. \"When you have two people like that on set together, it's still just a conversation. I wouldn't come over and give a note or direction unless I felt like I had an idea. It's all very informal \u2014 like three friends talking about ideas.\"/nSpeaking of superstar pairings, Singer was behind the camera when Taylor Swift and Zayn Malik took a walk on the dark side \u2014 Fifty Shades Darker to be exact. The duo recorded the chart-topping single for the trilogy-capping Fifty Shades installment. It was another smashing success for Swift, just ahead of her Reputation era./nAnd Singer found that Swift more than lived up to her reputation as a creative dynamo. \"I don't have enough nice things to say about her,\" he raves. \"Taylor's one of the sweetest and inspiring artists, and so down to Earth for being the biggest celebrity on the planet. I'm so grateful she called me to do that video.\"/nAnd Swift plans to add \"feature filmmaker\" to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as well. The singer \u2014 whose upcoming concert film, The Eras Tour, is on track to break box-office records \u2014 struck a deal with Searchlight to helm a narrative feature from a screenplay that she wrote. (Swift previously directed the short film, \"All Too Well,\" which screened at TIFF's 2022 edition.) \"She's going to be a phenomenal director,\" Singer says. \"Taylor's a once in a generation talent, and I can't wait to see the movie she makes.\"/nAfter the lush visuals of \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever,\" Singer embraced simplicity for his first collaboration with breakout New Zealand singer, Lorde. The director pulled out a 16mm camera and headed to L.A.'s MacArthur Park neighborhood with his star in tow. \"We wanted the video to feel timeless and that area almost looks like an artifact from the past,\" he says. \"It's not specific to L.A., either \u2014 it could be Ohio or somewhere in the Northeast.\"/nThe grainy 16mm visuals added to the video's timeless aesthetic, not to mention the saturated green colors that permeate the frame. \"I also love the amber light in that video,\" Singer recalls. \"There are these shades of color that feel very painterly. 16mm film oozes feeling \u2014 it's a little more pink and a little bit rougher and that felt like a nice counterpoint.\"/nSinger may be the credited director on the video for Sam Smith's haunting ballad, but he credits the non-binary English singer with originating the idea of a mannequin head being the main character. \"That was entirely their concept,\" the filmmaker says. \"I can't take credit for it \u2014 all I did was execute it.\"/nPart of that execution was finding the right visual references for the storefront, references that included vintage photographs and famous paintings like Edward Hopper's Nighthawks. \"Above all, I wanted that video to do justice to the song,\" Singer notes. \"Sam's song is so moving and emotional and a little bit harrowing, so the video needed to be that as well. I approach directing through feeling and emotion, and specifically with that one I was trying to capture a very particular feeling.\"/n\"To Die For\" was also the last music video that Singer directed before he turned his attention to Reptile. But he vows that it's not his final word on the form. \"I took some time off to make this movie, but I'd like to make more music videos for sure.\" And Singer found a way to acknowledge his music video past in his feature filmmaking present by casting Sky Ferreira in a small Reptile role./n\"The first day of shooting was a scene with Sky and Benicio,\" he says, proudly. \"I put her in the movie because I started my career making music videos with her. It was great to see how far we've both come.\"/nReptile is currently streaming on Netflix. "

A movie concert promotes post-Madonna, post-Obama mind control.\"/nYou can read it all for yourself, but here's one excerpt that's getting mocked ... \"The Swift circus doesn\u2019t replace the thrill of originality and profundity that accompanied the advent of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Supremes, the Jackson Five, which Gen Z knows nothing about. Instead, Swift specializes in degraded girl-pop -- teenage solipsism, the silliness that kids will ideally outgrow. Yet her songs corrupt puppy love into jejune sophistication.\"/nHe then compares the movie's director, Sam Wrench, to Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl ... namely, making Taylor's concerts far more grand/aesthetically pleasing than they actually are in person, the way Riefenstahl did for Hitler -- at least that seems to be White's POV./nNot just this, but White actually tries to juxtapose Swfities innocently dancing in theaters to mass shooter James Holmes, intimating a connection by writing ... \"The teens in TikTok clips who pitifully bounce and sing along with the film\u2019s pre-recorded concert are the flip side of those nerds and sociopaths who lined up for 'The Dark Knight Rises' in Aurora, Colo.\"/nIf that sounds unhinged, that's because it is ... that's certainly how Twitter feels about it, anyway. They're unloading on White's hyperbole over something as benign as a concert film./nHe ends his scorched-earth review this way ... \"Boomer parents may want to let them have their fun \u2014 same as toying with matches and playing in the traffic. But here\u2019s a frightening fact of the Swifties pheenom: These kids seem ready for a leader, anxious for totalitarianism. It will take a counterrevolution to repair Swift\u2019s moral, aesthetic, and political damage.\"/nFWIW, White is very much a man apart here ... 'cause just about every other film critic (big and small) has praised the 'Eras' movie for being what it is -- a wholesome, good time./nAlso ... her flick is poised to be the top dog (yet again) at the box office this weekend. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"

The next, it's scrawled with crevices./nIt's within that context that Taylor Swift exists. The pop superstar has been a fixture in the public realm since she was a teenager. And to many, she has retained that youthfulness. She's omnipresent in pop culture, her music soundtracking some of history's most notable moments./nPerhaps it's that presence that has made Swift retain her youth in the general public's eye. She's gotten older and wiser, that is for sure. But it's hard to conceptualize that when the first time many of us were introduced to her was when she was but a teenager, writing love songs on her six-string back in Pennsylvania./nSwift's sudden romance with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has many an onlooker confused. Part of why that is the case is because the duo seem on entirely different sides of the age spectrum. Kelce is the wily veteran whose spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame is certified. Swift, meanwhile, is a beacon of sprightliness, the soundtrack of millions of youngsters the world over./nMORE:\u00a0Where does Taylor Swift live?/nSo, just how big it the age differential between the two? Here's what you need to know:/nSwift and Kelce's fanbases may seem on different planes demographically. But things aren't always as they appear. For Swift and Kelce are mere months away from the same age. No, seriously.../nSwift was born on Dec. 13, 1989. Kelce's birthday? Oct. 5, 1989. As such, the couple (?) are separated by a little over two months in age. That's a 69-day difference. That's a breath of fresh air, especially when compared to the wide age differences \u2014 and the subsequently unequal power dynamics \u2014 that have come to define many relationships between cisgender heterosexual male celebrities and their partners (e.g., Leonardo DiCaprio)./nMORE:\u00a0Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce Tiktok trend, explained/nSwift has been in the pop culture nebula for more than a decade. As such, her age might sneak up on you. But the West Reading, Pennsylvania, native is\u00a033 years old\u00a0in 2023. And her 34th birthday isn't all that far away; Swift celebrates her 34th on Dec. 13./nKelce is no spring chicken in his own right, especially by NFL standards. The gifted pass-catcher is also 33 but has a birthday this week./nSo although the couple may seem in vastly different stratospheres in terms of age, in reality they are of the same generation. Go figure.../nDavid Suggs is a content producer at The Sporting News."

Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nIn the ever-competitive world of Hollywood, release dates for movies are meticulously planned months, if not years, in advance. Movie studios invest significant time and money into promoting their films, carefully selecting the perfect launch dates to maximize box office success. But sometimes, even the best-laid plans can be upended by a juggernaut./nWhen global superstar Taylor Swift suddenly announced her upcoming concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in late August, it sent shockwaves through the industry. One little concert film started a domino effect of release date changes in a shift that is rarely seen in the business./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is an eagerly anticipated concert film that documents Swift's ongoing tour of the same name. Filmed during three shows at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in August 2023, the upcoming cinematic experience promises to be a huge win for the singer. What truly set the industry abuzz, however, was Swift's surprise announcement of the tour itself later that same month./nSwift's surprise tour announcement caught both studios and exhibitors off guard. Her unexpected move led to a sudden realization that several films were slated for release on or around the concert film's debut date, October 13, 2023. With Swift's immense popularity and the anticipation surrounding The Eras Tour\u2014both on and off screen\u2014studios knew that competing with her was a high-risk gamble. Consequently, they had to make some tough decisions./nIn response to the impending release of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, a number of major studios took swift action to avoid direct competition with the Grammy winner with their upcoming releases./nUniversal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions made the bold move to move up the release of The Exorcist\u2014a reboot of the \u201870s classic\u2014by one week, so it is now scheduled to hit theaters on October 6, 2023. This strategic decision allows the film to potentially capitalize on the Halloween season without clashing with Swift's concert film...at least not at first./nBut it wasn't just The Exorcist that shifted gears. Several other films changed their release dates to steer clear of Swift's cinematic juggernaut. All of the following films have also been moved from their original October 13 release so as not to face direct competition with the singer and her Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour:/n/n/nThe decision to alter release dates for these movies was not a simple one. In fact, it comes with significant financial and logistical challenges. Movie studios invest substantial resources in marketing and promotional campaigns tailored to their original release dates. Changing those dates could mean reworking advertising strategies and renegotiating partnerships or perhaps even creating additional content to maintain audience interest. All of these adjustments can incur unexpected expenses that impact a film's budget./nFurthermore, while some films managed to find alternative windows to release, they may still face the lingering impact of Swift's concert film. Even with a shift in release dates, they risk sharing the spotlight with a cultural phenomenon like Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour./nSwift's fan base is known for its unwavering dedication, and the film's release is likely to generate a massive wave of enthusiasm. Movies that debut shortly after Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour may find it challenging to compete for attention and box office success, as the fervor surrounding the singer\u2019s film continues to resonate with audiences./n"

Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nIn a thrilling finale to her the U.S. leg of her The Eras Tour, Taylor Swift gave her fans the long-awaited revelation they wanted. The pop icon chose last night to officially announce her next addition to the re-recording series: 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)./nSwift's announcement electrified the atmosphere at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, leaving fans ecstatic over the news that the album is slated for release on October 27. Immediately after saying so in front of thousands, Swift took to social media to further tantalize her followers and provide a sneak peek into what lies ahead./nIn a carefully crafted Instagram post, Swift not only confirmed the impending release of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), but also shared a few key details about the project. Similar to her previous re-recorded albums, this upcoming release will feature a treasure trove of never-before-heard tracks. Swift's journey down memory lane has led her to unearth a collection of songs that were either written or recorded during the original album sessions but remained hidden from the world. These unreleased gems, affectionately dubbed \"From The Vault\" tracks, are among the most exciting facets of the re-recording process./nSwift's social media update provided a glimpse into the forthcoming album's unknown tunes. She revealed that 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) will include five \"From The Vault\" songs, in addition to the beloved tracks from the original album. About these cuts, Swift said in the caption, \"the 5 From The Vault tracks are so insane. I can\u2019t believe they were ever left behind.\"/nWhile details about these tracks remain sparse at the moment, their potential for chart success is high. The combination of Swift's artistry, the nostalgia still felt for 1989 and its many hits as well as the aura of anticipation surrounding these unreleased tunes sets the stage for yet another triumphant chapter in her career./n1989 was a monumental triumph in Swift's time in the spotlight, solidifying her status as a global superstar. The album's extraordinary commercial success had led to it earning a nine-times platinum certification, and soon it may become her second diamond-seller. The album's singles, however, were the true driving force behind its enduring impact./nThe 1989 era saw Swift dominate the charts with three No. 1 singles on the Hot 100. It is one of only a handful of albums to send that many cuts to the summit, even to this day. Iconic tracks such as \"Shake It Off,\" \"Blank Space\" and \"Bad Blood\" featuring Kendrick Lamar, reigned supreme for a time./nSwift's subsequent albums have yet to match this impressive feat, as none of them have produced more than one Hot 100 No. 1. Among her leaders, \"Shake It Off\" stands as Swift's crowning achievement and biggest hit yet, as it has been certified diamond with over 10 million equivalent units moved in the U.S. \"Blank Space\" also emerged as a standout hit, as it has been certified eight-times platinum, tying as her second-most-certified single./nThe album's tracks have collectively amassed over 36 million equivalent units in the U.S. alone. Collaborating with super producers and renowned hitmakers such as Max Martin, Ryan Tedder, and Jack Antonoff, Swift meticulously crafted a masterpiece that seamlessly bridged her transition from country to the pop realm. This transformation culminated in numerous Grammy wins and solidified her status as a musical icon./nEach track on 1989 held the potential for standalone success as singles, and if she\u2019d wanted to, she likely could have continued promoting the set for years. The original album did spin off half a dozen charting hits, and fans wanted more. Now, with the inclusion of the \"From The Vault\" tracks, the album's legacy is set to grow once more./nThe consistency of sound and thematic resonance throughout 1989 suggest that it\u2019s likely that these five \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d songs are in the same vein. They could sound and feel similar, which immediately sets them up for success. Imagine another \u201cShake It Off\u201d or \u201cStyle\u201d? They could follow the surprising chart ascent of current single \u201cCruel Summer\u201d which is also another electro-pop favorite that came several years later, inspired by some of the wins on 1989./nSwift's own excitement, reflected in her Instagram post, serves as a poignant reminder that these unreleased possible smashes possess the power to become hits in their own right. Nothing Swift says in social captions is a coincidence, so if she\u2019s hinting that they could be huge, the world needs to prepare for them./n"

Now, that sum climbs to 137 placements in the competitive region. She still trails only Drake, who has thus far accumulated 199 top 40 wins. So far, no other artist has reached 100 top 40 hits./nWith more music on the way and two more albums to re-record, it\u2019s only a matter of time before Swift ups that sum again. Perhaps next year, she may hit 150 top 40 smashes, and from there, it\u2019s impossible to tell how much bigger that figure can become./nHere is a list of where all of Taylor Swift\u2019s songs rank on the Hot 100 this week./nNo. 1 - \u201cIs It Over Now?

(Photo by George Pimentel/LP5/Getty Images for TAS)/nTaylor Swift's highly-anticipated album 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) is set to debut later this month, and it\u2019s sure to become another massive chart win when it arrives. This album serves as a slight reimagining of her pop blockbuster 1989, which first captured the world's attention back in 2014. With an impressive seven singles under its belt, 1989 is undoubtedly one of Swift's most beloved and commercial successful releases./nWhen it comes to measuring the success of individual songs from 1989, there are many ways to measure one track against another. One easy way to do so is by delving into the consumption patterns of Americans and seeing what they\u2019ve bought and streamed the most./nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the organization responsible for awarding gold and platinum certifications to songs and albums based on consumption in the U.S., provides valuable insight into which tracks have made the biggest impact./nTopping the list of Swift's 1989 hits, according to RIAA certifications, is the album's lead single, \"Shake It Off.\" The infectious anthem stands as Swift's sole diamond-certified hit, an accolade achieved when a track or album surpasses 10 million equivalent units in the United States./nFollowing closely behind is the chart-topping sensation \"Blank Space,\" which has earned an impressive eight-times platinum certification, signifying eight million equivalent units sold. Swift's \"Bad Blood,\" another Hot 100 chart-topper, is not far from \u201cShake It Off,\u201d as it boasts a six-times platinum certification after moving six million equivalent units./nTwo other singles from 1989, \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Style,\" have also reached multi-platinum status. \"Wildest Dreams\" has shifted four million equivalent units, while \"Style\" is inching closer to matching that figure, currently comfortably resting at triple platinum status./nTurning to non-single tracks from the album, two songs have earned platinum honors from the RIAA: the album opener \"Welcome to New York\" and the enchanting \"This Love,\" both of which have moved at least one million equivalent units. Sixth official single \"Out of the Woods\" is also a platinum hit for the singer\u2014one of dozens from her discography./nFour additional songs from 1989 have received gold certifications for surpassing the 500,000 equivalent unit mark. These include \"All You Had to Do Was Stay,\" \"How You Get the Girl,\" \"I Know Places\" and \"New Romantics.\"/nInterestingly, four songs from the album, including those featured on the deluxe edition, have yet to secure any certification from the RIAA. \"I Wish You Would,\" \"Clean,\" \"Wonderland\" and \"You Are In Love\" are all patiently awaiting recognition from the organization, though their eventual awards are likely on the horizon./nUpdate: This article originally stated that \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d had not yet received any certification from the RIAA. It was certified gold and then later, platinum./n"

    "content": "On the third night of Taylor Swift\u2019s marathon six shows in Los Angeles, fans came out in full force to experience her epic three-hour-plus performance of the sold-out Eras Tour./nAmid the dramatic outfits, homemade costumes, snaking merch lines and wholesome friendship-bracelet exchanges on Saturday, Swifties from across the country \u2014 and even around the world \u2014 paused to consider how the country-turned-pop-turned-folk/indie songwriter had affected their lives over her last 17 years of music making. /nAlmost everyone who chatted with these two reporters shared that Swift\u2019s music went much deeper than any break-up anthem or boy-crazed tune \u2014 her music has helped fans grow up, grieve, get through challenging times and, most important, find joy. /nAmanda Walsh of Irvine waited with her mom in a long line for Swiftie merch Saturday afternoon at Sofi Stadium. The 29-year-old had fashioned flowery butterfly wings from a tapestry, with some sewing help from her mother-in-law, meant to emulate the Nashville mural Swift posed in front of in 2019 to promote her \u201cLover\u201d album. (Don\u2019t worry, she said, she\u2019d take off the wings during the show so as not to block anyone\u2019s view.)/nA Swiftie from the beginning \u2014 Walsh saw the rising star perform when Swift was a teenager at Stagecoach\u2019s Country Music Festival in 2008 \u2014  she said it was one of Swift\u2019s more recent songs that had spoken to her most deeply. /n\u201cI actually lost my husband to cancer in January 2022, so the song \u2018Bigger Than the Whole Sky\u2019 really means a lot to me,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cJust because it\u2019s talking about all the possibilities that are honestly never going to get to happen./n\u201cI just think that song speaks a lot about grief,\u201d she said, \u201cand things you\u2019re missing out on when you deal [with] and go through loss.\u201d /nBrian Rush, 36, came to the show from Koreatown with his partner of five years, Justin Thai, who turned Rush on to Swift\u2019s music./nThe couple decided Saturday morning to splurge on floor seats, spending $3,000 to see Swift up close and (kinda) personal. /nAlthough he was dressed in a combination of \u201cRed\u201d- and \u201cLover\u201d-era outfits \u2014 mixing Swift\u2019s \u201cA lot going on at the moment\u201d T-shirt with a tie-dyed \u201cLover\u201d-themed button-down \u2014 he said he\u2019d found her \u201cReputation\u201d album most powerful. /n\u201cHow she came back, in a sense, from all the negativity and everything like that,\u201d Rush said. \u201cWe all go through that in life, when people have something to say about us.\u201d/nMichelle Ascencio, 36, drove up for the Saturday show from Tijuana, excited to take a trip down memory lane through all the Swift eras, each of which takes her her back to a specific time in her life. Swift\u2019s debut album reminds her of college dance parties with her girlfriends, she said, while later albums follow her adult life. /nBut it\u2019s \u201cFolklore\u201d that makes her emotional. /n\u201cWhen I listen to \u2018Folklore,\u2019 when I hear \u2018the 1\u2019 start playing in my head, it transports me back into time to during the pandemic,\u201d Ascencio said of the album released in 2020. /n\u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of endorphins during that time; we were still in the middle of the pandemic \u2014 and I just get chills just thinking about how much joy that album brought me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat, like, a breath of fresh air it was to hear Taylor Swift do something new./n\u201cSo \u2018Folklore\u2019 for me holds a special place because it brought me joy in a time where there wasn\u2019t a lot [of that] going on.\u201d/nMollie Alkazian has been a longtime Swiftie, but it wasn\u2019t until the \u201cLover\u201d album came out in 2019 that she really started to connect with the artist\u2019s music on a personal level. She attended Saturday\u2019s concert with friend and fellow Thousand Oaks resident Emma Jakl./n\u201cThe whole \u2018Lover\u2019 album was my first glance at her being older; she was growing up like we were,\u201d said Alkazian, who was dressed in a \u201cLover\u201d-style pink outfit complete with jewels and butterflies in her hair./nAlkazian, at 28, is a few years younger than the 33-year-old Swift, but the 2019 album\u2019s songs about true love brought home their shared experience \u2014 \u201cI like boys, too,\u201d she said, laughing./nSisters Megan and Robin Vo, 23 and 25, wore contrasting white and black outfits inspired by Selena Gomez\u2019s surprise performance with Swift on the 1989 album tour./nTheir father died around the time of the release of Swift\u2019s second album, 2008\u2019s \u201cFearless.\u201d Since then, the sisters have scored their lives with the music of their favorite artist./n\u201cIt helped me through all my middle school crushes and heartbreak,\u201d Robin said, naming \u2018You Belong With Me\u2019 as a particularly memorable song, mentioning her then-crush, Daniel. \u201cAnd she just gets it. She knows what heartbreak is at every stage in life.\u201d/n\u201c\u2018Midnights\u2019 helped us through med school,\u201d Megan said, nodding to her friend and classmate Liam Bell. \u201cWe grew up with her, she grew up with us, she\u2019s been there through every stage in life.\u201d/nStart your day right/nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

[+] Movie World Premiere at AMC The Grove 14 on October 11, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by John Shearer/Getty Images for TAS)/nTaylor Swift's latest movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, is currently gracing theaters and is well on its way to redefining box office success for concert films. While the title is already generating positive reviews and substantial earnings, the payday for Swift is merely another addition to her long line of massively successful current commercial ventures./nIn its opening weekend alone, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour has the potential to rake in an impressive $200 million globally at the box office. But this is just the beginning. By the time the film concludes its theatrical run, it could earn millions more, potentially exceeding another $100 million. Swift and her team reportedly take home over 50% of the box office grosses, which means that the singer stands to earn well over $100 million from this movie./nFor most musicians\u2014even the most prominent names in the industry\u2014the prospect of earning a nine-figure paycheck for a single project would be a dream come true and a game-changer. While Swift undoubtedly appreciates the financial rewards, this particular success pales in comparison to the tour that shares its name./nThe Eras Tour is still in its early stages, and Swift has a long road ahead before she wraps up the venture. With plans to visit several more countries before the end of 2023 and dates scheduled almost until the close of 2024, Swift's earnings from this tour are expected to be bigger than anything anyone\u2019s seen before./nAccording to a report by the Washington Post, Swift might pocket as much as 85% of the box office grosses for her tour, and when merchandise sales are factored in, her income per night soars even higher./nThe enormity of The Eras Tour is exemplified by the projections that it could bring in more than $2 billion by the conclusion of her North American dates, as reported by CNN. This is just one segment of the global tour, and she has many more shows left outside of the continent. The same Washington Post article states that Swift's total earnings from The Eras Tour could surpass $4 billion by the time it concludes./nIn comparison, while Swift is poised to achieve one of the top-grossing movies in the U.S. in 2023, the earnings from the film will still represent only a fraction of her total income that\u2019s connected to The Eras Tour. Swift might earn more than 20 times the amount from the actual The Eras Tour than from its accompanying blockbuster movie. These figures may be speculative at this stage, but the underlying message remains clear: the Grammy-winning artist is on track to secure one of the most significant paydays in not only her career but in the entire entertainment industry./n"

[+] March Los Angeles' at Los Angeles City Hall on June 30, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.  (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Families Belong Together LA)/nWhether they should or shouldn\u2019t be influential in politics, celebrities often find themselves at the forefront of important conversations, especially in election years. The biggest and most popular stars are often applauded for leveraging their platforms to influence public opinion and drive change./nTaylor Swift stayed out of politics for a long time, but her tune has changed. Now, following a move by the superstar to get out the vote, one of the most prominent Democrats in the country is praising the singer for her efforts./nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom headed to Simi Valley earlier this week to appear via media at the Republican\u2019s latest debate. While speaking with TMZ, the Democratic politician and likely one-day presidential candidate lauded Swift\u2019s influence, stating that it could play a significant role in the upcoming 2024 presidential election./n\"Taylor Swift stands tall and unique,\" remarked Governor Newsom in an interview with the celebrity-focused outlet. \"What she was able to accomplish in getting young people activated to consider that they have a voice and they should have a voice in the next election, I think it's profoundly powerful.\"/nNewsom went on to further praise the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d chart-topper, adding, \"I think she's using her celebrity for good.\"/nNewsom is referring to Swift\u2019s recent push to get her millions of Instagram followers to sign up to vote. On National Voter Registration Day, the Grammy winner took to her social media account to urge her fans, affectionately known as Swifities, to register to take part in the upcoming election. To do so, she shared a link to Vote.org, a non-profit voting registration platform and organization she has partnered with in the past./n\"I've been so lucky to see so many of you guys at my U.S. shows recently,\" Swift's statement read. \"I've heard you raise your voices, and I know how powerful they are. Make sure you're ready to use them in our elections this year!\" It was a simple message, but one that resulted in a massive spike in visits to the website. The Wrap reports that the organization saw a more than 1,200% jump in traffic following her post./nDuring the short chat with TMZ, Newsom also noted that not everyone shares this sentiment of Swift\u2019s move to get young people to take part in the democratic process. \"Republicans are critical of her encouraging people to register to vote,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cwhich says everything you need to know about the voter suppression going on in the Republican party.\"/nSwift's engagement in the political space is not a recent development. In recent years, she has become increasingly vocal about her political beliefs, endorsing candidates and advocating for issues that matter to her. For the first decade or so of her career, she steered clear of such topics, but eventually she felt the need to speak up, and since then has supported a handful of Democrat candidates./n"

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nThe pop star\u2019s record-breaking, career-spanning show has dominated the summer, commanding attention and whipping up demand at a level thought unachievable in a fragmented age./nBy Ben Sisario/nReporting from Kansas City, Mo., and New York/nAs Taylor Swift rolled into Los Angeles this week, the frenzy surrounding her record-breaking Eras Tour was already in high gear./nHeadlines gushed that she had given $100,000 bonuses to her crew. Politicians asked her to postpone her concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers. Scalped tickets were going for $3,000 and up. And there were way, way too many friendship bracelets to count./nThese days, the center of an otherwise splintered music world can only be Taylor Swift./nThe pop superstar\u2019s tour, which is now finishing its initial North American leg with six nights at SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles, has been both a business and a cultural juggernaut. Swift\u2019s catalog of generation-defining hits and canny marketing sense have helped her achieve a level of white-hot demand and media saturation not seen since the 1980s heyday of Michael Jackson and Madonna \u2014 a dominance that the entertainment business had largely accepted as impossible to replicate in the fragmented 21st century./n\u201cThe only thing I can compare it to is the phenomenon of Beatlemania,\u201d said Billy Joel, who attended Swift\u2019s show in Tampa, Fla., with his wife and young daughters./nIn a summer of tours by stars like Beyonc\u00e9, Bruce Springsteen, Morgan Wallen and Drake, Swift\u2019s stands apart, in numbers and in media noise. Although Swift, 33, and her promoters do not publicly report box-office figures, the trade publication Pollstar estimated that she has been selling about $14 million in tickets each night. By the end of the full world tour, which is booked with 146 stadium dates well into 2024, Swift\u2019s sales could reach $1.4 billion or more \u2014 exceeding Elton John\u2019s $939 million for his multiyear farewell tour, the current record-holder./nSwift has now had more No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 over the course of her career than any other woman, surpassing Barbra Streisand. With the tour lifting Swift\u2019s entire body of work, she has placed 10 albums on that chart this year and is the first living artist since the trumpeter and bandleader Herb Alpert in 1966 to have four titles in the Top 10 at the same time./n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty amazing feat,\u201d Alpert, 88, said in a phone interview. \u201cWith the way radio is these days, and the way music is distributed, with streaming, I didn\u2019t think anyone in this era could do it.\u201d/nBut how did a concert tour become so much more: fodder for gossip columns, the subject of weather reports, a boon for friendship-bracelet beads \u2014 the unofficial currency of Swiftie fandom \u2014 and the reason nobody could get a hotel room in Cincinnati at the end of June?/n\u201cShe is the best C.E.O., and best chief marketing officer, in the history of music,\u201d said Nathan Hubbard, a longtime music and ticketing executive who co-hosts a Swift podcast. \u201cShe is following people like Bono, Jay-Z and Madonna, who were acutely aware of their brands. But of all of them, Taylor is the first one to be natively online.\u201d/nSwifties have chronicled the stream of celebrity fans who have turned up each night: Julia Roberts, the New York Jets\u2019 new quarterback Aaron Rodgers, even Flavor Flav of Public Enemy. But Swift has also made each show a news event by adding two \u201csurprise songs,\u201d often with headline-grabbing guests. On the July day that she put out a music video featuring Taylor Lautner, an ex-boyfriend, the actor backflipped across the stage in Kansas City, Mo., and paid Swift effusive tribute \u2014 \u201cnot just for the singer you are,\u201d Lautner said, \u201cbut for the human you are.\u201d The crowd registered its approval with an earsplitting roar./nThe Taylorpalooza extends to every level of the news media, which began the coverage cycle by chronicling Swift\u2019s ticketing fiasco last November, when fans \u2014 and scalpers\u2019 bots \u2014 crushed Ticketmaster\u2019s systems, leading to a heated Senate Judiciary hearing. Since then, seemingly no nugget of Swift news has escaped coverage, from the stars in the stands to oddities like a Seattle concert that, according to one researcher, shook the ground with an intensity equivalent to a 2.3-magnitude earthquake./nMusic critics have portrayed the Eras Tour as showing Swift at the top of her game as a media-savvy, big-tent talent, a pop star with a knack for grand spectacle as well as the polished artistry of a classic songwriter./nShania Twain, the country-pop star whose career in some ways prefigured Swift\u2019s, caught the Las Vegas stop of the Eras Tour, a 44-plus song production that goes as long as three and a half hours. She praised Swift\u2019s \u201cbeautiful balance\u201d of high-tech stagecraft and intimate performance segments. \u201cI have to applaud her,\u201d Twain said in a telephone interview. \u201cAs a performer, I know that work that goes into it.\u201d/nThe power of Swift\u2019s fan army \u2014 and fear of crossing the star, or even appearing to \u2014 has kept nearly all of the press about the tour sunny. Though some fans (and parents) balked at the ticket prices and challenges of securing seats, most frustration was directed squarely at Ticketmaster, not Swift. After a few weeks of headlines romantically linking Swift with a frontman some fans considered to be problematic, reports spread in the celebrity pages that they had split. (Swift\u2019s representatives declined to comment for this article.)/nFor fans, the shows are a pilgrimage, and a rediscovery of the joys of mass gatherings. Flights are packed with Swifties, and travelers trade stories and compare outfits \u2014 drawn from looks associated with Swift \u201ceras\u201d \u2014 in stadium corridors and parking lots. In Kansas City, the comedian Nikki Glaser was attending her eighth show, a commitment that she estimated has cost her $25,000./n\u201cThis year I decided not to freeze my eggs,\u201d Glaser said. \u201cI\u2019m going to put that money toward the thing I love most in the world, which is Taylor Swift.\u201d/nBefore Eras, Swift hadn\u2019t been on tour since 2018. And her catalog has grown by seven No. 1 albums since then, fueled in part by three rerecorded \u201cTaylor\u2019s Versions\u201d of her first LPs \u2014 a project hailed by Swift\u2019s fans as a crusade to regain control of her music, though it is also an act of revenge after the sale of Swift\u2019s former record label, a move that, she said, \u201cstripped me of my life\u2019s work.\u201d/n\u201cFolklore\u201d and \u201cEvermore\u201d expanded her palate into fantastical indie-folk and brought new collaborators into the fold: Aaron Dessner from the band the National and Justin Vernon, a.k.a. Bon Iver, rock-world figures who helped attract new listeners./nThe other major tour this year that is enticing fans to book transcontinental flights, and to show up costumed and in rapture, is also by a woman: Beyonc\u00e9, 41, whose Renaissance tour is a fantasia of disco and retrofuturism. Like Swift, she is also a trailblazing artist-entrepreneur, maintaining tight control over her career and fostering a rich connection with fans online. Together with Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie,\u201d a critique of the patriarchy told in hot pink, they are signs of powerful women ruling the discourse of pop culture./nBut in music, at least, the scale and success of Swift\u2019s tour is without equal. Later this month, after completing 53 shows in the United States, she will kick off an international itinerary of at least 78 more before returning to North America next fall. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s full tour has 56 dates; Springsteen\u2019s, 90. (Recently, Harry Styles wrapped a 173-date tour in arenas and stadiums, grossing about $590 million.)/nOutside Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, fans posed for selfies and shared their ticketing ordeals. Esmeralda Tinoco and Sami Cytron, 24-year-old former sorority sisters, said they had paid $645 for two seats. A stone\u2019s throw away, Karlee Patrick and Emily DeGruson, both 18 and dressed as a pair in angel/devil costumes after a line in Swift\u2019s \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d sat \u201cTaylorgating\u201d at the edge of the parking lot; they said they had paid $100 for parking but couldn\u2019t afford tickets./nAs Swift\u2019s opening acts finished, the crowd rushed in. Glaser, the comedian, later said that of the eight shows she had been to, her favorites were the ones where she had brought her mother \u2014 and converted her to Swiftie fandom./n\u201cEveryone is in love with her,\u201d Glaser said her mom told her after one show in Texas. \u201cNow I get it.\u201d/nBen Sisario covers the music industry.

With 1,287,000 sales in the United States, it was the biggest start for any album in more than a decade, and affirmed Swift as a megaselling force./nSince then, Swift has scored eight more No. 1 albums. But incredibly, she has now topped the first-week total of her original \u201c1989\u201d with a remake of the same LP. It starts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with the equivalent of 1,653,000 sales in the United States \u2014 the biggest opening sales week of Swift\u2019s career \u2014 and 3.5 million around the world, according to Republic Records, her label. It is the biggest debut for any album since Adele\u2019s \u201c25\u201d eight years ago, which started with nearly 3.4 million in the U.S., a number that remains unsurpassed./n\u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d is Swift\u2019s 13th No. 1 album, and her sixth to have more than a million sales in a single week \u2014 more than any other artist since at least 1991, when Billboard\u2019s charts were first based on reliable sales data. It also caps an extraordinary year for the pop star, who has saturated nearly every corner of popular culture./nThe new \u201c1989\u201d is Swift\u2019s third title to reach No. 1 in 2023, after an expanded version of her last studio album, \u201cMidnights\u201d (2022), returned to the top spot in June; \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d the last installment in her project to rerecord her first six studio albums \u2014 an effort to reclaim her music after the sale of her former record label \u2014 arrived in July. Her Eras Tour has been a record-breaking phenomenon, expected to gross well over $1 billion in ticket sales by its finale next year. Her movie \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d released last month, easily became the biggest concert film of all time. And let\u2019s not even get into how Swift has lifted N.F.L. television ratings./nWhen the original \u201c1989\u201d came out, it was not available on streaming services. Swift was then one of a number of prominent holdouts who kept her music off the new format, over concerns about its financial model. Since then, of course, streaming has taken over the music business, and Swift has long since made her music available on all major platforms. But \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d still outperformed the original in old-fashioned sales, thanks in part to her canny marketing of collectible physical media \u2014 a strategy now widely used across the pop world, but perhaps most effectively by Swift, the rapper Travis Scott and an array of K-pop acts./nOf the 1,653,000 \u201cequivalent album units\u201d attributed to the new \u201c1989\u201d \u2014 a composite number that Billboard and its data partner, Luminate, use to reconcile sales and streams \u2014 1,359,000 were for sales of albums, surpassing the total for the original \u201c1989.\u201d The new album sold 693,000 copies on vinyl, the largest week of sales for that format since at least 1991. It also surpasses Swift\u2019s own vinyl record of 575,000 for \u201cMidnights,\u201d a year ago./n\u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d sold 554,000 copies on CD, the biggest weekly number on that format since Adele\u2019s \u201c25.\u201d According to Billboard, the new \u201c1989\u201d was available in 15 versions on physical formats, including five colored vinyl variants, eight CDs and two cassettes./nIn addition, \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d had 375 million streams, the most in a single week for any of Swift\u2019s four rerecorded albums./nAlso this week, the K-pop ensemble Seventeen opens at No. 2 with \u201cSeventeenth Heaven,\u201d an eight-track release that the group calls its 11th \u201cmini-album,\u201d which sold 98,000 copies on CD. Drake\u2019s \u201cFor All the Dogs\u201d is No. 3, Bad Bunny\u2019s \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d is No. 4 and Morgan Wallen\u2019s \u201cOne Thing at a Time\u201d holds at No. 5./nBen Sisario covers the music industry.

(Photo by Graham Denholm/Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift recently announced her upcoming re-recording, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), much to the delight of her massive fan base. The singer revealed the album cover and release date, October 27, during a momentous performance during her ongoing The Eras Tour. Since this much-anticipated revelation, fans across the country have flocked to revisit the original 1989, propelling its iconic songs to dominate Spotify's charts./n14 tracks from the original 1989 have swiftly surged onto Spotify's list of the most-streamed songs in the U.S. This remarkable presence marks a substantial increase from the prior day, when legions of Swifties eagerly anticipated the thrilling announcement had already started streaming the familiar cuts from the album./nNearly every gem from the 1989 era makes its presence felt on the chart, with numerous tracks either making their debut or reaching previously unknown heights. The numbers reported below are as of Friday, August 11./nSix 1989 tracks soar to new peaks following the announcement. Spearheading this resurgence is \u201cStyle\u201d which rises 20 spots to settle at a new peak of No. 8. \"Blank Space\" comes next and isn\u2019t far behind, surging an impressive 25 places to settle at No. 12, narrowly missing the coveted top 10 nearly a decade after its initial release./nOther chart-climbing hits include \"Shake It Off,\" which ascends a staggering 117 positions to land at No. 34. \"Out of the Woods\" ventures to a noteworthy new peak of No. 41, while \"Bad Blood\" shoots to No. 57. \"Wildest Dreams\" reappears at No. 63, and the anthem \"Welcome to New York\" achieves its best chart position yet at No. 82./nImmediately after announcing 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), Swift performed the song \"New Romantics,\" a bonus track on the original 1989. That attention has helped the tune score an impressive debut on the Spotify U.S. chart, starting at No. 31. This win represents the highest-ranking new entry from the superstar, but it is far from the only one./nAn array of fellow 1989-era melodies, including \"All You Had to Do Was Stay,\" \"I Wish You Would,\" \"Clean,\" \"How You Get the Girl,\" \"I Know Places,\" \"Wonderland\" and \"You Are in Love,\" all claim their rightful spots on the chart for the first time. These tracks, spurred by the excitement of the 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) announcement, have enjoyed a meteoric resurgence in popularity, hitting the tally for the first time, as their heyday was largely before the ranking was popular./nThe sheer magnitude of the news and the excitement felt by Swift\u2019s fanbase have also breathed new life into a familiar tune. The re-released version of \"Wildest Dreams,\" aptly renamed \"Wildest Dreams (Taylor\u2019s Version),\" had previously graced this prestigious ranking, and its return at No. 151 reflects the insatiable energy surrounding Swift's announcement./nBeyond the dozen-plus streaming sensations from 1989, Swift's presence is felt all across Spotify's 200-spot chart. In fact, that album doesn\u2019t even make up half of the tunes she has on the tally./n\"Cruel Summer\" holds at its No. 2 position, proving itself to still be a streaming giant. A collection of beloved hits spanning multiple albums\u2014including Lover, Reputation, Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version), and the recent Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u2014all find space as well, ranking as among the most-streamed in America./n"

On the album chart, Bad Bunny debuts at the top./nBy Ben Sisario/nFour years ago, Taylor Swift included the song \u201cCruel Summer\u201d on her album \u201cLover.\u201d It became a fan favorite, and had been in line to be released as a single in 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic changed all plans. \u201cThat is something that happened that stopped \u2018Cruel Summer\u2019 from ever being a single,\u201d the singer said a few months ago./nBut this year, Swift played the song on her record-breaking Eras Tour, and it was belatedly given the proper promotional push. After breaking into the Top 10 in July, \u201cCruel Summer\u201d has finally made it to No. 1, becoming Swift\u2019s 10th track to top Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart./nOver the last week, Swift went all out to promote it. She discounted the track for digital sales and released an EP containing a remix and a live version, \u201cso we can all shriek it in the comfort of our homes and cars,\u201d as she announced on social media./nLast week, \u201cCruel Summer\u201d had nearly 19 million streams in the United States, sold 41,000 downloads \u2014 up from around 2,500 the week before \u2014 and had 78 million \u201cairplay audience impressions,\u201d a measurement of a song\u2019s popularity at radio, according to the tracking service Luminate./nOn this week\u2019s album chart, Bad Bunny sailed to the top with his latest album, \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d (\u201cNobody Knows What Will Happen Tomorrow\u201d), which the Puerto Rican superstar released on Oct. 13 with just a few days\u2019 notice. The album, his third to reach No. 1, opened with the equivalent of 184,000 sales in the United States, including 240 million streams and 7,500 download sales, according to Luminate./nBad Bunny, who was the host and musical guest on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d over the weekend, released \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti\u201d last year \u2014 a surprise, like \u201cNadie Sabe\u201d \u2014 and it went on to top the Billboard album chart 13 times; he was also the world\u2019s top touring artist in 2022./nBad Bunny\u2019s success bumps Drake to second place after one week at No. 1 with \u201cFor All the Dogs.\u201d Also this week, the K-pop quintet Tomorrow X Together opens at No. 3 with \u201cThe Name Chapter: Freefall,\u201d which sold 106,000 copies as a complete package and drew about 12 million clicks on streaming services./nZach Bryan\u2019s self-titled LP is No. 4, and \u201cSet It Off\u201d by Offset, of the Atlanta rap trio Migos, opens in fifth place./nBen Sisario covers the music industry.

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nMovies like \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d rely on savvy tricks and sophisticated techniques to capture a semblance of the live experience./nBy Calum Marsh/nTaylor Swift\u2019s globe-spanning Eras Tour is one of the musical events of the year, drawing record-breaking crowds and making headlines the world over since it kicked off in Glendale, Ariz., in March. Rabid demand has made procuring a ticket notoriously difficult, if not practically impossible. But starting Friday, Swifties will have a more accessible opportunity to catch a glimpse of the live phenomenon, when the concert film \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d is released by AMC Theaters \u2014 a moviegoing event that is widely expected to be a box office smash./nFilmed over three nights in August at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., and directed by Sam Wrench, \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d like most concert films, aims to capture some of the magic of seeing the artist perform live. \u201cThe main thing we\u2019re trying to do is provide the theatrical audience with the best seat in the house,\u201d John Ross, the rerecording mixer on \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d and a veteran of many other hit concert films, including Jonathan Demme\u2019s \u201cJustin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids,\u201d said by phone. \u201cIf you were to attend a concert and get the premium seat, that\u2019s my job, to convey that image sonically and situationally.\u201d/nBut capturing a live performance is not as straightforward as simply setting up some cameras and microphones and recording what transpires onstage. The demands of a film are incredibly complicated, and faithfully reproducing the look and sound of a concert for the screen is an arduous and painstaking process for the filmmakers and their crews. It\u2019s a delicate proposition \u2014 a proposition some filmmakers believe is inherently doomed./n\u201cThe idea itself, to film a concert, is a bad idea,\u201d said Jonas Akerlund, a film and music video director who made the concert movies \u201cOn the Run Tour: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z Live\u201d and \u201cTaylor Swift: The 1989 World Tour Live.\u201d/nHe explained, \u201cIt will never, ever be as good as the live experience. It\u2019s basically like trying to film fireworks \u2014 everybody knows that seeing it live is not the same as seeing it on a TV screen.\u201d But, Akerlund added, the concert film can have value, if looked at in a different way. \u201cYou can make it an equally good experience, but it has to be a filmic or cinematic experience rather than trying to compete with the live experience.\u201d/nThe secret to cinematic merit, he said, is having the time and means to shoot it like a proper movie. That means hiring upward of 40 camera operators; shooting over multiple nights; deploying drones, Spidercams and GoPros; and setting aside a separate dress rehearsal day, when the artist plays without a crowd to shoot extra footage, like close-ups that might not have been possible during the live show. All of the footage is assembled in the editing room \u201cwith the precision of a four-minute music video\u201d to create the illusion that what you\u2019re seeing was unfolding in real time. \u201cI guess it\u2019s cheating a little bit,\u201d Akerlund said./nThese kinds of cheats are common and, to hear filmmakers tell it, necessary. When the \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d director Jon M. Chu made \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never,\u201d he shot the performance and the audience on separate nights, then edited them together because that, paradoxically, made the audience\u2019s reaction feel more authentic. \u201cI always love concert films where it feels like the audience is really there,\u201d he said. But because of the cameras, the sound recording equipment and the lighting, \u201caudiences don\u2019t react as big\u201d as they would on an ordinary night. \u201cYou try to emulate what it feels like,\u201d he said./nOne of the most surprising things about the making of concert films is just how much tends to be emulated, even simulated, rather than merely captured as is. The actual sound of music being played live in an arena can\u2019t merely be taped: \u201cjust a recording of the room would be useless,\u201d Ross said. Instead, dozens of microphones \u2014 sometimes more than 100 for larger sites \u2014 record the vocals, instruments and crowd on separate tracks, and a rerecording mixer carefully blends them together, adding reverb and echo to simulate the sound of the space./nIn other words, the tone of the room is essentially applied like a filter to the raw sounds recorded from the artist onstage. This filter, known as impulse response, takes readings from actual physical places, then \u201csynthetically reproduces the sound of a real space like a club or stadium,\u201d said Jake Davis, the lead mix engineer at SeisMic Sound, an audio facility in Nashville that specializes in concert films./nMixers like Jake and his father, Tom Davis, the SeisMic founder, have a lot of control over the sound in a concert film, and making adjustments is a large part of their job. Some are minor refinements. Others are more like corrections: They make the concert film sound more like what the artist wanted than what necessarily occurred on the night it was filmed. \u201cWhen you lock something down for a DVD or for streaming or whatever it is, once it\u2019s done, it lives forever,\u201d Tom Davis said. \u201cIt never goes away. So you kind of want it to be as good as it can be.\u201d/nMixers can blend parts of a song recorded on one night with parts from another night to create the best combined version. They can fix an errant flat note in a guitar solo by manipulating it in postproduction, or they can ask an artist to rerecord a weak vocal in a studio, layering it into the mix so that it sounds as if it had been delivered live. \u201cWe copy, cut and paste, like you do on a word processor,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf there was a little clam in the first chorus, but he did it fine in the second chorus in the same part, we can cut and paste that. We can do vocal maintenance. We can fix a little pitch issue, or bend a note a little bit.\u201d/nAlthough sound mixers record the crowd with a bevy of microphones hidden around the arena, it\u2019s possible \u2014 and indeed, common \u2014 to exaggerate the sound of that audience, to artificially give the cheering fans some extra kick. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a dirty secret,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut the sound of the real audience is weak. It\u2019s not enough. You end up adding to it, pumping it up. There\u2019s something psychological to hearing other humans having a good time and reacting \u2014 it\u2019s like a sitcom and a laugh track.\u201d Jake Davis said that the ideal balance is to \u201cstart with the real reaction\u201d and then simply \u201cmake it bigger and more obvious.\u201d/nOf course, part of the appeal of a live show, even on film, is the impression of reality, and a sense of truth is critical. \u201cThe goal of the mix is to enhance the energy of the performance that exists as it went down in the best way possible,\u201d Jake Davis said. \u201cYou maintain some element of rawness while taking out things that are distracting, the nuances of a wrong note or a background singer being a little bit off.\u201d/nWhile the film version strives to be \u201cas good as it can be for the rest of history,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a fine line between correcting something a little bit and making it perfect, because it\u2019s not going to be perfect live.\u201d It\u2019s a bit like touching up a portrait in Photoshop: it\u2019s tempting to clear blemishes, but too much airbrushing can make you look fake./nPaul Dugdale, the director of \u201cShawn Mendes: Live in Concert\u201d and \u201cTaylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour,\u201d said that while some live shows might lend themselves to \u201cmaximum authenticity\u201d as an approach, other huge pop concerts don\u2019t emphasize the authentic in the same way. \u201cFor shows that are quite theatrical, there\u2019s a level of artifice \u2014 they\u2019ve got screens, they\u2019ve got pyrotechnics, they\u2019ve got costumes, all that kind of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cFor someone like Taylor, I think that allows you to explore further in terms of camera angles and putting the audience in different positions.\u201d/nA Swift concert, Dugdale pointed out, can last more than three hours, which affords the director more latitude in how to approach the film formally. \u201cYou can create texture just like the live show has texture,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you can go heavy-handed with the director\u2019s hand, and sometimes you can completely let go of the steering wheel and let the artist take over.\u201d/nDespite the high level of difficulty, the job for filmmakers and sound engineers is quite thankless. The best concert films will, to the unwitting viewer, seem like nothing more than filmed concerts \u2014 the filmmaking itself remains invisible./n\u201cThe goal is that you don\u2019t want people thinking about the fact that this was worked on or changed at all from what it was live,\u201d Jake Davis told me. \u201cYou just want the audience to be immersed in the experience and to accept that it\u2019s happening in front of them \u2014 to feel like they\u2019re there.\u201d /nBut Dugdale noted that however much he tries to plan out a concert shoot, the live aspect will always prove unpredictable. \u201cMaking these films, you can be as prepared as you can possibly be, but in the end you have to hold on for dear life and see how it turns out.\u201d/nAdvertisement"

Was she a musician?'\"\u00a0/nTo laughs, Jacob and Sheinelle then said that if anyone had taken a look at Steve's Instagram it may make more sense, with Sheinelle quipping: \"I may live under a rock but you're like [under a] rock rock.\"\u00a0/n\"I knew she was prominent,\" Steve replied, adding: \"I'll put it that way but I didn't know the name.\"\u00a0/nSteve became a household name during the\u00a02020 United States presidential election,\u00a0with his unique analytical style enticing new fans into political math, and his clothing fashion kicking off a new trend for khakis.\u00a0/nHe appeared on the Today Show to discuss Taylor and rumored new beau Travis Kelce's relationship, and matched up their stats; they were both born in 1989 and while Taylor has been in the industry for 17 years, Travis \u2013 a two-time Super Bowl champion \u2013 has been with the Kansas City Chiefs for 11 years.\u00a0/nThe pair have been getting closer, and her appearance at the Chiefs vs Chicago Bears game on Sunday September 24 left the sports world and entertainment worlds in meltdown.\u00a0/nLater that night video footage obtained by Daily Mail revealed that Taylor had departed Travis's upscale mansion in Kansas City with a group of his friends and family. The entourage then boarded a party bus destined for Arrowhead Stadium where they watched the game, and saw Travis score a touchdown to help his team win 41-10.\u00a0/nA visibly excited Taylor was seen cheering, seemingly yelling \"let's [expletive] go,\" celebrating Travis\u2019s third-quarter touchdown reception, and chest bumping with Travis' pals.\u00a0/nTravis and his brother Jason, a Philadelphia Eagles player, host a podcast 'New Heights' and in this week's episode Travis labeled her decision to attend the game as \u201cballsy\u201d./n\"I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her \u2014 the friends and family. She looked amazing and everybody was talking about her in great light,\" he said.\u00a0/nTaylor is a long-time fan of NFL team the Eagles,\u00a0having grown up outside the city as a child before she moved to Nashville as a young teen.\u00a0/n/nDuring her Eras Tour concert in the city, she also confirmed that the lyrics, \"With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door\" \u2013 from her song 'Gold Rush,' off of 2020 album Evermore\u00a0\u2013 is about the football team and not the band.\u00a0/n\"I did see the debate about, I have a lyric that says, 'With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door,' and I saw people wondering if it was the band Eagles or the team the Eagles, and I love the band but, come on, I am from Philly of \u00a0course it's the team,\"\u00a0she told screaming fans."

He said on the New Heights podcast he'd made a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it to give to Swift after seeing an Era's Tour performance, but never got to give it to her. The speculation only grew last week when Kelce told The Pat McAfee Show he'd invited her to a game.

In a somewhat wishy-washy answer -- she appears to say, that's not the case./nWhen asked if her single, \"vampire,\" was aimed at Taylor, she says ... \"I mean, I never want to say who any of my songs are about. I\u2019ve never done that before in my career and probably won\u2019t. I think it\u2019s better to not pigeonhole a song to being about this one thing.\"/nOlivia adds, \"I was very surprised when people thought that.\" So ... sorta a denial?/nThe reason some jumped to that conclusion is 'cause the track's lyrics go after somebody Olivia labels as a \"blood sucker\" -- but in which way, exactly, was up for interpretation./nThe chorus goes ... \"'Cause I've made some real big mistakes / But you make the worst one look fine / I should've known it was strange / You only come out at night / I used to think I was smart / But you made me look so naive / The way you sold me for parts / As you sunk your teeth into me, oh / Bloodsucker, famef***er/ Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire.\"/nWaiting for your permission to load TikTok Post./nMany took these lines to be referencing the plagiarism scandal Olivia found herself in after her first album, 'Sour,' got released. As you know, she ended up having to pay both Taylor and Paramore royalties after they flagged similarities in a couple of her songs to her team./nAs it turns out ... the amount she had to shell out for those two songs amounted to 50%, according to The Guardian. Many felt Olivia was done dirty in that whole saga, and those same people believed she was expressing her frustration to TayTay in that new single./nLike we said, it certainly seems like Olivia is distancing herself from that characterization -- but the fact she doesn't firmly stamp it out in clear terms is ... interesting, to say the least./nOlivia reflected on that chapter, saying ... \"I was so green as to how the music industry worked, the litigious side \u2026 I feel like now I know so much more about the industry and I just feel \u2026 better equipped in that regard. It wasn\u2019t something I thought about too much.\"/nEven here, there's a tone of resentment over the fact she was gouged by well-established artists, way bigger than her at the time. If she is mad at them, she's masking it well."

The singer songwriter has a concert film coming to theaters next month, and some in the movie industry are expecting the title to be historic in terms of its box office draw./nAccording to insiders and industry experts who spoke to The Hollywood Reporter, the film could open to $100 million in ticket sales based on early purchases from fans who already have a pass./nThat figure is bigger than many regular films, but it may be just the beginning for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.

Within the first 24 hours that tickets were made available, the film's presales skyrocketed to a staggering $26 million. This figure set a new benchmark for the company, surpassing the previous record holder for resales in such a short period of time, 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home, which raked in $16.9 million in first-day ticket sales./nWhile demand may be incredibly high, AMC is working to match what Swifties want. The theater chain is working on ensuring that no Ticketmaster-style fiascos take place when people are ordering their tickets. The company is also planning on showing Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour at least four times a day on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays for several weekends./nSwift's Eras Tour, which kicked off in March of this year in Arizona, has been nothing short of a phenomenon. It sparked an unprecedented demand for concert tickets, which broke Ticketmaster and led to a governmental inquiry into its practices. The trek, which is still just in its early stages, has already shattered world records in terms of attendance and concert tour revenue. It is on its way to becoming the first tour to bring in $1 billion in ticket sales./n"

[+] This Is It\" midnight madness DVD release celebration at Best Buy on January 25, 2010 in New York City.  (Photo by Mike Coppola/FilmMagic)/nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is in theaters all around the world now, and the title is well on its way to making history. The singer\u2019s movie, which showcases her current The Eras Tour, is killing it at the box office, and it is expected to become one of the top-grossing concert films of all time after its opening weekend. By the time Swift\u2019s picture is done in theaters, it will surely rank as the most successful performance release ever./nWhat competition does Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour face on its way to making history in this manner?/nCurrently, the record for the highest-grossing concert movie of all time belongs to Michael Jackson's This Is It. Released in the wake of his untimely passing, the concert film and documentary provided an intimate look at the legendary artist's preparations for a tour that was set to be his final trek. By the time it concluded its theatrical run, This Is It had amassed an astounding $261 million at the box office./nThis Is It stands as the only concert movie to break the $100 million mark at the box office, a feat that has yet to be surpassed. However, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour set new records by raking in at least $100 million in advance ticket sales, so Jackson\u2019s milestone is about to be officially beaten./nIn the second spot for highest-grossing concert films is Justin Bieber's Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, which was released in 2011. The young pop star\u2019s movie earned just over $99 million worldwide, coming very close to that $100 million milestone./nMiley Cyrus, who was also known as Hannah Montana at the time, lands in third place with Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert. The 2008 release brought in a little under $71 million at the box office, setting a record until Jackson's This Is It surpassed it several times over the following year./nRounding out the top five in the musical concert film category are One Direction: This Is Us, with $68 million in box office earnings, and Katy Perry: Part of Me, which grossed $32.7 million./nAn honorary mention goes to K-pop sensation BTS, whose BTS Permission to Dance on Stage - Seoul: Live Viewing also achieved box office success. That title missed out on tying Perry\u2019s total by just $100,000./nThis ranking changes when comedy performances are taken into account. Films featuring comedians such as Eddie Murphy, Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac, along with the legendary Richard Pryor, have also proven to be box office hits. While these films aren't traditional concerts, they are categorized as performance films and sometimes included in rankings alongside musical concert films./nAs Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour continues its impressive theatrical run, projections suggest that it could make as much as $200 million in its opening weekend. By the time it departs from theaters, the total earnings may grow by tens of millions of dollars, if not another $100 million./n"

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nNicki Minaj hosted and helped close out a nearly four-hour show heavy on performances and reaction shots of Taylor Swift in the audience./nBy The New York Times/nThe MTV Video Music Awards returned to the Prudential Center in Newark on Tuesday night, as Nicki Minaj hosted a nearly four-hour show that included the members of \u2019N Sync coming together to present a Moon Person trophy to Taylor Swift (who gushed directly to the boy band, \u201cI had your dolls\u201d) and Sean Combs receiving a global icon honor (and telling the crowd his career had humble beginnings, as a paperboy). The Brazilian pop star Anitta delivered one of the event\u2019s most solid one-liners \u2014 \u201cI want to thank myself because I worked so hard,\u201d she said in an acceptance speech \u2014 which she also proved onstage, performing both a solo medley and a collaboration with the K-pop group Tomorrow X Together. At the end of the night, the following five moments stood out./nOne of pop-rap\u2019s most unpredictable voices turned out the night\u2019s most polished and high-concept performance, capturing the anxiety of return to office in a look perhaps best described as \u201cbusiness sexual\u201d while surrounded by dancers doused in ghoulish red paint. The audience looked confused and a little terrified as Doja Cat glided around the stage nailing her marks, the calm in an increasingly hectic storm./nOlivia Rodrigo\u2019s \u201cVampire\u201d video dramatizes an awards show performance gone wrong, and though it has 54 million YouTube views, none of those evidently came from V.M.A.s audience members like Selena Gomez, who looked stricken when Rodrigo partly recreated the clip Tuesday night. After the song\u2019s first section, lights seemingly burst onstage and a curtain fell as a \u201cstagehand\u201d ushered the singer away \u2014 only to return seconds later grinning and performing another song from her new album, \u201cGuts,\u201d the bouncy \u201cGet Him Back!\u201d/nCardi B and Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s first televised performance of their hit \u201cWAP\u201d came at the 2021 Grammys, and their salacious choreography caught the attention of over 1,000 viewers who complained to the Federal Communications Commission, Rolling Stone reported. The duo reunited last week with a fresh collaboration called \u201cBongos,\u201d and played it relatively safer on the V.M.A.s stage. The censors caught most of the profanities and the audience camera caught one of the night\u2019s many shots of Swift dancing along./nPerforming a mega medley to celebrate receiving the video vanguard award, the Colombian pop star didn\u2019t appear to be doing much live singing, but her lengthy number included plenty of choreography, hair flipping, microphone stand tossing, guitar playing, a quick wardrobe adjustment, crowd surfing and a lift bringing her high above the crowd. But a truly eye-grabbing moment came halfway through, when she wielded two knives, dramatically running one across her torso before tossing them aside./nThe Grammys went big with a tribute to 50 years of hip-hop earlier this year, but MTV\u2019s celebration of rap\u2019s anniversary had some highlights, too: After Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh gave the crowd a lesson on the genre\u2019s beginnings, Minaj emerged with \u201cItty Bitty Piggy,\u201d one of her beloved early mixtape tracks, then reunited with her mentor Lil Wayne for \u201cA Milli.\u201d LL Cool J commanded the stage for two of his own songs, then went (shell) toe to toe with Run-DMC\u2019s Darryl McDaniels on \u201cWalk This Way.\u201d (The performance mostly elided the 1990s, but Diddy\u2019s eight-minute performance earlier in the night covered that era.) It was a reminder that MTV was once the home of \u201cYo! MTV Raps,\u201d and used to spend a lot more time on music./nAdvertisement"

And here's the crazy part -- Kim Kardashian dated Reggie Bush, Gisele [Bundchen] was married to Tom Brady, and the world never stopped for those people.\"/nClark continued ... \"When Taylor Swift was sitting in the suite with Donna Kelce, it totally changed the dynamic of that game. And when Patrick Mahomes is out on the field playing against a team that decided to draft Mitchell Trubisky instead of him, and he's absolutely doing it big nobody cares because freakin' Taylor Swift's in the suite saying, 'Let's effing go.'\"/nIt's no small feat to be \"bigger\" than the NFL. In fact, despite only being shown to two-thirds of the country, over 24.3 million people tuned in to the game ... and saw Swift sitting alongside Donna Kelce./nThe NFL is routinely the most viewed show on television ... and nothing else is even close. An astounding 200 million people globally watched the Chiefs and Eagles battle for the Lombardi Trophy in February./nSwift's impact was also shown in merch sales -- as we previously reported, there was a 400-percent increase in Kelce jersey purchases after the game./nClark understands how big the moment is -- he literally analyzes the league for a living and is currently featured on \"Inside The NFL,\" which airs Tuesdays on The CW./nClark told us it's been an amazing experience working with some of the greatest minds in the sport ... and broke down what makes the opportunity so special."

The news was shared by Billboard with data provided by Luminate, the company tasked with tracking music consumption figures in America that feed the Billboard charts./n1989 (Taylor's Version) has already claimed the title of 2023's biggest sales week, a feat it managed in less than a full seven days. After only a few days, it is also one of the most successful releases of the year./nThe title has also exceeded the initial sales figures of Swift's previous release\u2014significantly, in fact. Her most recent re-recording, Speak Now (Taylor's Version), debuted with 507,000 copies sold this summer. The remarkable success of 1989 (Taylor's Version) places it in a league of its own, and it boasts the most substantial sales week for any album since the debut week of Swift's own Midnights, her last album of all original material. That project opened with a remarkable 1.14 million copies sold last October./nWith the confirmation of over one million copies already sold, it is all but certain that 1989 (Taylor's Version) will open in the coveted No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart in the coming week.

While it has already sold one million copies, it will likely open atop the Billboard 200 with a much larger sum, perhaps several hundreds thousand units higher once all sales and streams are factored in./n"

(Photo by Sarah Morris/FilmMagic)/nLater this week, Taylor Swift will officially descend onto theaters around the world with her concert movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The film is apparently a showing of a date (or more likely, several) on her The Eras Tour, which is on its way to becoming the highest-grossing trek of all time. Everyone is focused on this exciting new project from the superstar, but not much has been heard about another movie she\u2019s attached to\u2013one that was supposed to see her trying out some new skills./nIn December 2022, it was revealed that Swift had written an original script for a narrative full-length feature, the first of her career. The singer had reportedly signed with Searchlight Pictures to work on her movie, which is a good partner, as the company has been behind some major critical darlings, like Best Picture winners The Shape of Water and Nomadland./nSwift reportedly not only wrote the movie, the title of which was never shared publicly, but she aims to direct it as well. The superstar has spent years directing her own music videos to much success and acclaim, and she is looking to have her talents in that department taken seriously in another field./nIt was major news when this story broke in late 2022, but in the months since then, nothing has been heard about this project. Swift has been incredibly busy throughout 2023, as she\u2019s been traveling the country (and then parts of Central America) on her The Eras Tour. The trek has been immensely popular and a commercial juggernaut, and she has dates lined up into next November./nOn top of her historic tour, Swift has also released a re-recorded album, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), which included a new music video and which went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. As if that wasn\u2019t enough music for fans, she has another one coming at the end of the month, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)./nIt\u2019s unclear if Swift has found time in between tour dates and studio sessions to work on her movie. She likely has to do a lot of rewrites on her script, which are common in the movie industry. Even if it was 100% finished, a director needs to set aside a lot of time for meetings, calls, casting, and more\u2013all the things associated with making a film. It seems impossible that she\u2019s been able to do much of that work in 2023, as she\u2019s simply been too busy./nSo far, it appears that no updates have been given about this Swift movie. Whether that\u2019s because all the work is actually happening behind the scenes, or perhaps because nothing has changed in the past several months, is unclear. It\u2019s interesting that as the promise of her own movie seems to fade further and further into the past, the Grammy winner is about to dominate the global box office./n"

Blasphemy or high praise? /nWhatever you want to call it, Taylor Swift fans in Brazil gave the pop superstar a divine welcome on Thursday by projecting a Swift-inspired T-shirt on the country\u2019s most iconic landmark: the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. /nA projection that read \u201cWelcome to Brasil\u201d and other slogans \u2014 inspired by Swift\u2019s \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d and her Junior Jewels T-shirt from her \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d music video \u2014 lit up the 125-foot-tall monument when she touched down in the South American nation on Thursday.

Thursday\u2019s display \u2014 ahem, (Taylor\u2019s version) \u2014 was created by Gabriel Dadam, an art director for one of the singer\u2019s fan clubs, and the decision to pay tribute to the singer was made in conjunction with the Christ the Redeemer Sanctuary located at the foot of the sculpture. The stunt was catalyzed by a fan campaign and charity drive benefiting the Holy See\u2019s World Day of the Poor on Nov. 19./n\u201cThe Sanctuary will bear all the costs of the projection and will continue with its mission, which is to welcome everyone with open arms,\u201d the fundraising site said./nThe sanctuary\u2019s rector, Father Omar Raposo, agreed to pay for the projection if Swifties could collect 20,000 units of mineral water and panettone (sweet bread) to be donated to the needy. /nAFP reported that Raposo challenged them to raise 300,000 reais ($60,000) to be used to give out food baskets for the Pope Francis-led initiative. Swifties reportedly collected 180,000 reais in less than 24 hours and the campaign has been extended through Sunday \u2014 the last day of Swift\u2019s three-night stint in Rio \u2014 to give people more time to contribute./n\u201cWe did it Swifties !!

[+] \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at Foro Sol on August 24, 2023 in Mexico City, Mexico. (Photo by Hector Vivas/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTaylor Swift rules the Hot 100 again this week, but not with the tune that controlled the tally for the past two frames. Instead, she replaces herself at No. 1 on the ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S. as \"Is It Over Now?\" takes over for \u201cCruel Summer.\u201d With another leader in her discography, the singer makes history on the Hot 100 yet again, and she does so in a very strange manner./n\"Is It Over Now?\" marks Swift\u2019s third No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 in 2023. That\u2019s impressive enough as it is, but one detail makes this latest champion even more eyebrow-raising. Swift has now charted three No. 1 songs on the Hot 100 this year\u2026and they\u2019re all from different albums./nShe first summited the Hot 100 in 2023 with \u201cAnti-Hero.\u201d The Midnights hit debuted atop the chart in 2022 when the album it\u2019s featured on arrived, and it ruled for a time. Then it surged again in popularity in early 2023, returning to the peak position./nLess than a month ago, her recent single \u201cCruel Summer\u201d finally climbed to the top spot. The track was first released four years ago on her album Lover, but it wasn\u2019t spun off as a single until mid-2023, after it surged in popularity following its inclusion on the setlist for her The Eras Tour. \u201cCruel Summer\u201d ruled until \"Is It Over Now?\" arrived./nAccording to Billboard, Swift is the first woman to manage the feat of collecting a trio of Hot 100 leaders in one year, all from different projects. When looking at all acts, she\u2019s not alone, but her accomplishment is still incredibly rare./nThe last musical act to send three songs to No. 1 on the Hot 100 from different albums in a calendar year was the Jackson 5. The band that launched Michael Jackson to superstardom managed the showing back in 1970 with some of their first hits./nBillboard also notes that The Beatles hold the record for the most chart-toppers on the Hot 100 from distinct albums in a single year. The Fab Four\u2014who happen to be back on the Billboard charts this week with their \u201clast\u201d single \u201cNow and Then\u201d\u2014sent half a dozen tracks to the highest rung on the tally in 1964, and they came from five different albums./n\"Is It Over Now?\" serves as the latest single from Swift\u2019s new album 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). That project, a re-recorded version of her pop blockbuster 1989, opens atop the Billboard 200 with the largest debut sum of her career./n"

The \u201cFamous\u201d rapper and the singer were embroiled in another feud that year after he claimed on the track that he was the one who made her, well, famous./n Music /nTaylor Swift has embarked on her highly anticipated greatest-hits tour of the United States.

(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)/nTaylor Swift has been experimenting with her promotional efforts throughout 2023, releasing several singles simultaneously from different albums. Surprisingly, this risky marketing strategy has paid off beautifully, as she accomplishes a feat that only a few musicians have achieved on one of Billboard's competitive radio charts./nThis frame, Swift secures three spots inside the top 10 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, a weekly ranking that highlights tracks reaching the largest radio audience among stations labeling themselves as adult contemporary. Essentially, the chart showcases the most popular songs fitting that genre description based on their radio airplay./nInterestingly, Swift's highest-ranking hit on the Adult Contemporary chart is the oldest among her selections. \"Anti-Hero\" maintains its No. 2 position, a remarkable feat for a track that has spent a considerable time on the tally. Released in late 2022, the song swiftly climbed to No. 1, marking another major success for Swift. Now, it\u2019s just one rung shy of ruling again./nThis week, \"Anti-Hero\" misses out on another turn at the No. 1 spot to Miley Cyrus's \"Flowers,\" which has dominated the tally for an impressive 21 weeks. Both songs stand as relatively old contenders on the chart in terms of radio rankings./nLifting to a new high this week, \"Cruel Summer\" rises to No. 8 on the Adult Contemporary chart, up from No. 9 in the previous period. The electro-pop track hails from Swift's 2019 album Lover, and its unexpected success as a radio hit, long after its initial release, is worthy or highlighting./nJust two positions further down the Adult Contemporary chart, another Swift song makes an appearance. \"Karma,\" the singer's third official single from Midnights, keeps at the No. 10 position, continuing its presence in the top 10. Interestingly, while the song was initially released as a duet with rapper Ice Spice, it's the original solo version that charts on the Adult Contemporary tally. The tune previously climbed as high as No. 9./nAchieving a top 10 position on any of Billboard's radio charts is no easy feat for any artist. Garnering multiple wins from an album is impressive, and accomplishing this simultaneously underscores a star's status. While Swift's trio of concurrent placements within the highly competitive region might not be unprecedented, it's a milestone that only the industry's biggest players can manage. Such a feat also requires a unique set of circumstances, as stiff competition can challenge even the most prominent musicians./n"

(Photo by Taylor Hill/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management )/nIn a little over a month, Taylor Swift will dominate movie theaters across the U.S. with her upcoming concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The movie is essentially a shot-for-shot remake of her current global trek, The Eras Tour, which is on its way to making history./nThe title is already one of the most highly-anticipated projects coming to theaters in the second half of 2023, but fans shouldn\u2019t count on seeing it at the upcoming Academy Awards./nFrom the moment Swift announced Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour on August 31, fans began speculating as to whether or not it would earn the singer an Oscar nomination. Many suggested online that since it was being released in theaters, it was eligible, with some opining that it might end up in the running in the Best Documentary Feature field...but it turns out that competing for the biggest prize in the movie world isn\u2019t quite so easy./nAccording to the rules set down by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the organization that hands out the Oscars each year (and pointed out by The Wrap), Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour already appears to be ineligible for at least most of the awards given out./nOne section of the guidelines the focuses on what can be entered for contention and what can\u2019t stipulates that, \u201cWorks that are essentially promotional or instructional are not eligible, nor are works that are essentially unfiltered records of performances.\u201d This makes it pretty clear that Swift won\u2019t be winning any gold for this film, at least not in most categories./nIt\u2019s been well-known that Swift has been working toward an Oscar nomination for many years. She\u2019s appeared in films, though never earned enough praise to be seriously in the running for an acting prize. In 2022, she hit the ground running to shake hands and meet voters in an attempt to snag a nomination for her music video All Too Well: The Short Film, which she directed. She was hoping to land in the Best Live Action Short Film category, but she didn\u2019t end up a nominee./nSwift has also been attempting to collect a Best Original Song Oscar nomination for quite some time, but somehow, she has failed to do so. She has been up for the same prize at the Golden Globes on four separate occasions, but none of those nods have translated to the Academy Awards. The superstar is already a 12-time Grammy winner and 46-time nominee, and she\u2019s also won an Emmy./nWhile Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour won\u2019t earn Taylor Swift an Oscar nomination\u2014or at least that\u2019s how it seems\u2014it\u2019s sure to make her an even richer woman. The movie reportedly brought in at least $26 million in ticket sales on the first day of pre-sales, and it\u2019s just getting started. Some in the film industry are suggesting that the title could bring in somewhere between $100 and $150 million, and the predictions only go up from there./n"

    "content": "Taylor Swift/nIn terms of the scale and enthusiasm of her fanbase, it sure seems like Taylor Swift is this generation\u2019s Beatles (I\u2019m not comparing their music, chill!). First, it was her record-setting Eras concert tour, now it\u2019s\u2026a movie based on that record-setting Eras concert tour, which has hit theaters this weekend./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is scoring exceptionally well, a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, and a 99% from audiences, and I am pretty sure it was a flat 100% about a day ago. That\u2019s higher than even Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon at 95% (though again, not comparing quality). The point being, it\u2019s wild to think that a reproduced concert experience is going to likely be one of the biggest movies of the year./nThat said you\u2026may not want to actually see it. Well, that depends who is reading this. Social media is abuzz with a bunch of videos showing Swifties scream-singing and dancing in the theater along with the music, which is getting roasted by snarky quote tweets./nI think that is kind of\u2026stupid? I mean, how are you going to get a bunch of Taylor Swift fans in a concert movie together and expect them not to sing along with her songs along with a couple hundred of similarly-minded folks, most of whom are probably teens?/nSo, you have two choices, you can either go see the movie and understand that you have a very significant chance of being with this kind of crowd (and if you are this kind of crowd, go nuts), or you may just want to wait until you can watch/rent the movie at home. Sure, it\u2019s a downgrade from a movie theater, which is itself a downgrade from the live concert (it genuinely was one of the best live shows I\u2019ve ever seen), but it\u2019s still going to be worth watching if you\u2019re even a casual fan. Probably one who doesn\u2019t want to spend $800 on a ticket or dance in the aisles with 18 year-olds./nI think it\u2019s actually pretty cool to see a reaction to a concert movie like this? If I was a big fan, I feel like this would be a lot more fun than sitting around in silence watching her sing onscreen. Granted, we don\u2019t really have this kind of situation happen often, as almost no other artists are big enough to have a wide-released theatrical concert experience like this. It reminds me of when I used to watch some WWE pay-per-views in theaters, and I mean, of course everyone was shouting and yelling during the action./nThis is going to make a lot of money and it\u2019s already well-liked by critics and fans. Just don\u2019t get mad when you go yourself and vibe is concert-like./nFollow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram./nPick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and The Earthborn Trilogy./n"

(Photo by John Shearer/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTaylor Swift recently thrilled her devoted fan base with a long-awaited announcement. At a recent concert, she unveiled the upcoming release of her re-recorded album, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), a project that has been eagerly anticipated by her followers for some time now./nThe pop masterpiece, originally released as 1989, is poised to make its triumphant return, reimagined under Swift's artistic lens in an effort for the singer to regain control over the title. Thankfully, the set is coming soon, as the album is scheduled to drop on October 27. One thing seems almost certain: 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) is poised to claim the coveted No. 1 spot on the prestigious Billboard 200 chart./nThroughout her career, Swift has exhibited an extraordinary track record of chart-topping success on the Billboard 200. Since her second album, Fearless, debuted atop the tally in 2008, every subsequent musical endeavor she has shared with the world has soared to No. 1 on this all-encompassing ranking of album consumption in the U.S./nSwift has already amassed an impressive collection of 12 chart-toppers, a feat that includes her recent re-releases of re-recordings. As 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) surely enjoys robust pre-order sales, its ascent to the pinnacle of the chart upon its release appears virtually assured./nThe all but certain forthcoming chart-topping success of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) will mark Swift's third No. 1 album of the year, an accomplishment that underscores her enduring and unrivaled popularity. When the title does open in first place, Swift will join the ranks of several esteemed musicians who have also achieved this remarkable feat, further solidifying her place among music's elite./nHer 2022 album, Midnights, briefly reclaimed the summit a few months ago after an impressive run late in the prior year after it was re-released on vinyl. Swift's most recent re-recording, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), also earned two chart-topping turns in the past month, giving her another leader on the chart./nSecuring three No. 1 albums in a single year is a monumental accomplishment, one that places Swift in the company of some truly legendary figures. The elite club of artists who have achieved this feat includes iconic names like Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Elton John, Garth Brooks, and even the cast of the beloved TV show Glee./nSwift is no chart supremacy and in fact, she previously achieved the distinction of securing three No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 in a single year. Her historic run unfolded in 2021, when her album Evermore kicked off the year as the first No. 1. Throughout the remainder of the year, her re-recorded versions of Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version) and Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) both ascended to the summit as well./nAs the world eagerly awaits the debut of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), the question of its eventual impact looms large, and the album's potential to make a monumental splash upon its release is undeniable. With Swift's history of blockbuster numbers, the possibility of a debut with more than half a million units, and even potentially nearing the million mark, is well within reach./nThe certainty of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) opening at the summit of the charts is nearly beyond dispute (as nothing is certain until it happens), so now her fans only need to wait to see the final number of just how huge the reworked pop opus will be./n"

The singer and her team have been busy attempting to send it to No. 1 on rankings everywhere, but so far, the tune hasn\u2019t quite made it to the top spot on most lists.

Morgan Wallen led the charge with his hit \u201cLast Night\u201d as recently as the chart dated September 2./nIf \u201cCruel Summer\u201d does eventually rise to No. 1, it will mark Swift\u2019s milestone tenth leader on the Canadian Hot 100. Swift currently sits in fifth place when looking at the artists with the most leaders on the tally, placing one win behind Katy Perry. Should \u201cCruel Summer\u201d make it one more space, she\u2019ll officially claim the fourth-most No. 1 hits in history, tying with Perry./nIn the coming weeks, Swift faces more tough competition from new singles and returning champions. In the next few frames, the No. 1 on the Canadian Hot 100 could go to Olivia Rodrigo, Drake, Wallen or perhaps Cat will hold onto the highest spot...or maybe Swift will finally get a turn in the spotlight./n"

About 200 people each year take that 45-minute helicopter ride to the desert for the festival, he said./nEarlier this year, IEX also added a shuttle service to Day Trip, the electronic dance music festival by the Queen Mary in Long Beach, Villalobos said./nBy Tuesday afternoon, IEX had nine inquiries from customers seeking helicopter shuttle rides, Villalobos said.

Before Taylor, Kayla was also a supportive girlfriend who would attend many of Travis\u2019 games since the start of their romance, and she also\u00a0publicly gushed over his success on Instagram./nKayla recently got attention when she unfollowed her former friend Brittany Mahomes, who is Travis\u2019 teammate Patrick Mahomes\u2018 wife, as well as Patrick\u2019s brother, Jackson Mahomes, on Instagram. The action came just days after Taylor and Brittany were spotted having dinner with friends and on the same day they were spotted sitting together during the Chiefs game on October 1. Kayla has not publicly given a reason for the unfollows, but many suspect Travis\u2019 alleged romance with the \u201cMidnight Rain\u201d crooner could have something to do with it./nFind out more about Kayla and her romantic history with Travis below./nTravis and Kayla first got together in May 2017. Throughout their relationship, they walked high-profile red carpets together, including the ESPY Awards and Nickelodeon Kids\u2019 Choice Sports Awards. Kayla was also by Travis\u2019 side when he celebrated his 2020 Super Bowl win at the Chiefs victory parade. However, by the beginning of August 2020, fans noticed the two had unfollowed each other on Instagram. Days later, Travis confirmed that he and Kayla had split. At the beginning of December 2020, Travis did a Q&A, and confirmed they had gotten back together when he referred to Kayla as his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d during the chat. Days later, she posted a video of herself celebrating a Chiefs win on Instagram. Travis and Kayla ended their relationship for good in August 2022./nWhen Travis and Kayla broke up in August, there was speculation that the reason for the split was because he had cheated. However, he took to Twitter to deny allegations of infidelity, and there was no evidence that he had been unfaithful. \u201cThis is fake news\u2026a lie,\u201d Travis tweeted and subsequently deleted.. \u201cAnd not why Kayla and I broke up. Take all your hatred somewhere else, please.\u201d/n/nA post shared by Kayla Nicole (@iamkaylanicole)/n/nKayla works as an on-camera host, while also dabbling in some modeling. She has reported for outlets including BET, NBA, HotNewHipHop and more. Additionally, she\u2019s worked as a reporter for the Los Angeles Lakers and has interviewed various celebrities, as seen in her video reel./nThe gorgeous gals were very close throughout the time Kayla was dating Travis. They regularly attended Chiefs games at Arrowhead Stadium together and posed for many photos together. Kayla also accompanied Brittany for her pre-wedding, including her bridal shower, before she tied the knot with Patrick in 2022. They went wedding dress shopping, and Kayla was one of the select few to come on her eight-person bachelorette weekend in February 2022./n/nA post shared by Kayla Nicole (@iamkaylanicole)/n/nKayla is also very into fitness and started her own fitness brand called Strong Is Sexy. She sometimes shares videos of her workouts to her YouTube and Instagram pages and says that the brand is meant to \u201crefresh sexy from the inside out.\u201d Kayla\u2019s personal Instagram has more than 700,000 followers and her Strong Is Sexy page once had more than 50,000. She started Strong Is Sexy in 2020, but it\u2019s unclear if she\u2019s still actively involved with it./nAs of now, it appears that the sports journalist isn\u2019t romantically linked with anyone. Since she is enjoying the single life, Kayla uses her platform to promote positivity./n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTravis Kelce & Kayla Nicole: Photos Of The Exes\t\t\t\t\n"

    "content": "After Taylor Swift was spotted cheering on potential new beau Travis Kelce at Sunday\u2019s Kansas City Chiefs game, many had a field day imagining what the Taylor bump would mean for football. All those young Swifties snatching up Kelce jerseys (now on sale at Macy\u2019s, you\u2019re welcome); getting T & T decals on their newly red, white and gold nails; and bringing down the internet with Google searches for \u201cwhat does tight end mean?\u201d/nNone of which even crossed my mind. In part because I try to avoid reflexive sexism and patronizing the young whenever I can, but mostly because I was thinking less about the sport and more about the town./nWas Kansas City having its breakthrough moment at last? /nMy son has been telling me that KC was about to become the next San Francisco \u2014 OK, Austin \u2014 ever since he moved there a year ago. With a population hovering around 500,000 (2 million  in the wider metro area), Kansas City may be small, but as my son assures me on an almost daily basis, it is bristling with artists, writers, musicians, entrepreneurs, sports teams, political activism and, of course, the best BBQ east and west of the Missouri River./nAs images of the star cheering the Chiefs from a box at Arrowhead Stadium flew across social and then legacy media, I wondered if maybe, just maybe, he was right./nI mean, Taylor wouldn\u2019t date a Chief if Kansas City wasn\u2019t cool. So would the woman who just boosted local economies all across the country with her record-breaking concert tour soon be sprinkling her pixie dust on the Paris of the Plains? /nCould their nascent relationship last long enough for Taylor to be spotted strolling at the Plaza or picking up fresh produce at the River Market? Would she and Kelce be caught canoodling amid the biker merch at Blip Roasters in the West Bottoms, brewery-hopping in the Crossroads or debating sauces at Arthur Bryant\u2019s?/nLook at what she did for ketchup and \u201cseemingly ranch.\u201d  Just days after a viral tweet showed her eating chicken tenders with said condiments (not quite avant-garde choices, admittedly), Heinz announced  a new \u201cketchup and seemingly ranch\u201d product. /n\u201cIt\u2019s a new Era for Heinz. Introducing Ketchup and Seemingly Ranch,\u201d the company wrote on its Instagram. \u201cLimited-edition bottles coming soon.\u201d/nA mere rumor that Swift was making a post-game visit to Free State Brewing Co. in nearby Lawrence, Kan., sent fans flocking. (She was not there.) /n Music /nCultural dominance. History-making album sales. Sold-out stadiums. Add them up, and Taylor Swift\u2019s current moment has little precedent in pop-music history./nAug. 1, 2023/nEven if Travis and Taylor don\u2019t wind up together forever & always, maybe KC could at least get its own lyric, right? /nThe city certainly has endless poetic possibilities. Straddling the Missouri River and the state border, it is a city of bridges that is often at odds with itself \u2014 abortion is legal in Kansas, for instance, not so much in Missouri. Surrounded by farmland, sitting smack dab in the middle of the country, it faces the same struggles \u2014with racism, housing instability, addiction and economic disparity \u2014 that every American city does and many of those \u2014 drought, dwindling agriculture and manufacturing jobs \u2014 more associated with rural America./nFar from being a flyover city, however, it also has a brand new $1.5 billion-dollar  terminal at the Kansas City International Airport, which brings the absurd scene in \u201cTed Lasso\u201d in which Ted\u2019s son apparently flies nonstop from London to KC a bit closer to reality \u2014 and makes it possible for visitors to eat BBQ literally the moment they get off the plane./nThis year, Kansas City hosted the NFL draft; next year it will open the first stadium built specifically for a pro women\u2019s soccer team in the country. By 2025, 3.5 miles of track will be added to the Kansas City streetcar route, stretching it from the riverfront through popular city destinations to the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In 2026, KC will be one of 16 host cities for the World Cup./nOld stockyards and abandoned red-brick storehouses are gradually filling with hipster bars and coffee shops, galleries and artisanal-everything shops. The riverfront is lined with new apartment buildings and condominiums, and construction just began on the abandoned Rock Island Bridge, which will become an event space filled with restaurants and bars./n And now, perhaps, regular swarms of Swifties. /nTo be fair, Kansas City already has one shining star: Patrick Mahomes. Earlier this year, the Washington Post\u2019s Annie Gowen crowned Mahomes \u201cThe King of KC,\u201d noting that the Chiefs quarterback has already had a huge impact on the city, not just by leading the home team to three Super Bowls and two victories but also by investing in Kansas City, literally and figurative. /nHe has stakes in the Kansas City Royals as well as the city\u2019s professional soccer teams, the Current (women\u2019s) and Sporting Kansas City (men\u2019s). He recently brought the San Antonio-based chain Whataburger north (after tweeting that he missed it). And he and his wife, former professional soccer player Brittany Mahomes, are building a home in the city\u2019s southern suburbs./nNo wonder they lit up city hall in honor of the birth of each of their children, pink for Sterling, blue for Bronze./n Entertainment & Arts /nKansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce opens up about Taylor Swift watching him play Sunday. \u2018It was definitely a game I\u2019ll remember,\u2019 he said./nSept. 27, 2023/nBut with apologies to Mahomes, he is not Taylor Swift. When the Empire State Building recently shone red and white, its official X account captioned the photo \u201cketchup and seemingly ranch.\u201d /nIf Taylor Swift starts showing up regularly in Kansas City the airport may have to build another terminal. If she posts about liking a certain BBQ sauce, that sauce will sell out in a New York minute. /nMore importantly, many people who never gave the place a second thought, even after last year\u2019s Super Bowl win, may find themselves thinking that everything is up to date in Kansas City. Including fans on either coast who may not be able to locate the city, or either state it\u2019s in, unless there\u2019s an election map in front of them. /nWhich in these divided times could only be a good thing. /nThat\u2019s a lot of pressure to put on a relationship that may or may not advance beyond a few dates, though reportedly Swift plans to attend Sunday\u2019s game between the Chiefs and the New York Jets in New Jersey. /nIt\u2019s also fairly ridiculous. Except it\u2019s not. If Swifties are going to be running around wearing Chiefs jerseys, buying football tickets and the nakedly opportunistic ketchup and seemingly ranch, if pundits are going to continually speculate on what it all might mean for NFL ratings and ESPN subscriptions ... well, maybe they could also pay a bit of attention to the city for which Kelce plays. /nMy son is a bit miffed that it took Taylor Swift for me to acknowledge that he might just be right about the city in which he has chosen to live. /nBut hey, it takes what it takes to break out in this noisy world. Maybe seeing Taylor Swift yelling her head off at a football game will do the trick./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

(Photo by Hugo Hu/LP5/Getty Images for TAS)/nIn early November, Taylor Swift will collect another No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with her about-to-be-released set 1989 (Taylor's Version). The re-recorded take on her first pure pop collection is all but guaranteed to reach the top spot, and when it does, it will mark the third time the set of songs breaks into the highest tier on the all-encompassing ranking of the most-consumed full-lengths in the U.S./n1989 was first introduced to the Billboard 200 back in late 2014. Swift topped the tally once again with the blockbuster release, which wasted no time going right to No. 1. 1989 opened atop the ranking with 1.287 million copies sold./nIn the years since 1989 debuted at No. 1, the set has continued to perform well on the Billboard 200. In fact, it has even returned to the top 10 recently, after interest in the title surged following Swift's announcement that it was to be the next to be re-recorded and re-released./nA year after Swift dominated the Billboard 200 with 1989, singer-songwriter Ryan Adams put his own spin on the set. The rocker recorded a complete covers album, not mixing up much from the original. Adams's version of 1989 debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 in the fall of 2015. Impressively, it launched just one spot ahead of Swift's edition, which was still going strong inside the top 10 at the time./nNow, Swift is about to return to the highest region on the Billboard 200 with 1989 (Taylor's Version). There's no telling exactly how big the title will be when it arrives, but so far, all three of the re-recordings that Swift has released have gone straight to the summit, and they keep getting bigger and bigger. 1989 (Taylor's Version) could possibly open with a million equivalent units, or perhaps just under that, making it not only the largest entrance sum for one of her re-records but one of the biggest in recent memory./n"

The invite-only thrifting suite in TriBeCa will be decked out with the reseller\u2019s hand-curated items for fashion week. /n\n\tMeanwhile, Poshmark is also coaxing influential fashionistas into its ranks. The reseller will return to its peer-to-peer activations with a live selling suite at The Hotel Chelsea for a one-on-one consultation and guided resale experience in late August ahead of NYFW. The Posh team is offering up the service to media and special guests to offload the selling responsibility. Sellers bring in five to 10 items and meet with a closet consultant. From there, all sellers have to do is tune in to a live show, set the price of their goods and watch as viewers bid on their items./n\n\tThe social aspect is a reigning differentiator at Poshmark. \u201cAs social media increasingly accelerates microtrends, consumers are purchasing, wearing and discarding their clothes more than ever,\u201d said Chloe Baffert, head of merchandising and curation at Poshmark. \u201cShopping secondhand is an easy and sustainable way for consumers to keep up. From the cultural phenomenon of Barbie and highly sought after merch from Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift\u2019s summer tours, to Bella Hadid\u2019s soccer-inspired blokette aesthetic dominating the athleisure category, social media trends quickly populate on Poshmark.\u201d/n\n\tGiven National Thrift Shop Day on Aug. 17, promotions ran all month across ThredUp and all week at GoodwillFinds (the e-commerce store for Goodwill), with special promotions and parties popping up from independent sellers on Poshmark. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/n\n\tThough GoodwillFinds has no planned presence at fashion week, Matthew Kaness, chief executive officer of GoodwillFinds, said the company is still riding the thrifting high. \u201cThe key to fashion in any era is responding to consumer trends and cultural moments \u2014 and given the heightened interest in the circular economy, thrifting is an undeniable component in fashion\u2019s future.\u201d/n\n\tAccording to insights from First Research, the used merchandise industry in the U.S. encompasses more than 20,000 stores with combined annual revenue of roughly $15 billion. Publicly listed resale companies are catching their strides as they chase profitability. Reseller ThredUp posed a strong second quarter lifted by new company initiatives while The RealReal further fine-tuned its new strategy under CEO John Koryl. \u2014 Kaley Roshitsh/n\nOUT OF THIS ORBIT: This year\u2019s Superstar award winner at the Fashion Group International\u2019s Night of Stars will be someone whose work always celebrates someone else: Andrew Bolton./n\n\tAs the Wendy Yu curator in charge at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute, he has introduced millions annually to the work of scores of designers.

[+] \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at Foro Sol on August 24, 2023 in Mexico City, Mexico. (Photo by Hector Vivas/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTaylor Swift conquers pretty much everything she sets her mind to. She\u2019s the biggest star in music, and with her forthcoming concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, she\u2019s set to dominate the box office as well. After coming out on top in both of those industries, what\u2019s left for her to do?/nWhat about the White House?/nThe View co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin recently suggested that if Swift were to run for president, she could potentially have a shot at the job...or at least beat one of the top candidates in the race. \u201cTo be honest, if Donald Trump looks like he\u2019s gonna win, she\u2019s just gonna need to get in the race and defeat him once and for all, because she\u2019s probably the only person who can!,\u201d Griffin stated during an episode of The View: Behind the Table, a podcast hosted by the TV show\u2019s executive producer that\u2019s an offshoot of the main program./nGriffin added, simply, \u201cThis ends in one way; we are all Taylor Swift fans.\u201d/nThe TV host previously served in the Trump administration as a communications director. She was in support of the then-president until he refused to concede after he lost the 2020 election. She would later go on to disavow her former boss after the January 6 insurrection at The Capitol./nSwift is certainly popular enough to go after anything she wants, but is she well liked enough to actually make a play for the highest office in the land? According to a recent political poll conducted by Emerson College, the idea of Swift running as a third-party candidate wasn\u2019t too well-received. That poll deduced that those who took part preferred Trump, favoring him at 42% over Biden, who received a 39% share. 10% of those involved were undecided, while the singer only managed to claim 8%./nWhen asked simply how they viewed Swift, 43% of those who were a part of the poll said they saw her favorably, 38% said they were neutral, and 19% viewed her unfavorably./nHypothetical presidential matchups, like the one involving Swift mentioned by Emerson College in its poll, often serve as interesting discussion points, but the likelihood of Swift running for president remains highly unlikely./n"

Only 16.1 percent of workers, a distinct minority, are union members, according to the BLS. Even if the numbers were reversed, that would be no justification for California\u2019s Lt. Gov. to try and shut down Taylor Swift\u2019s shows. That would force the singer to cancel contracts for the shows, void the tickets purchased in advance, and, as the Orange County Register put it, \u201cpunish music fans looking for entertainment.\u201d/nAt the time of this writing, Swift has announced no plans to cancel the shows.

Taylor showed up and slipped in through a back area, but got caught on camera entering the building./nThis time around, TayTay had some A-list company ... including Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, among others. She's expected to be in a luxury suite near the field, and word is ... she'll be joined by Travis's mom, Donna Kelce -- like last week./nAs for TS's entourage -- Blake makes sense ... they're best buds, and they were just out and about yesterday together in the Big Apple -- not to mention a starry dinner alongside some other famous ladies, like Sophie Turner and even Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany./nHugh's not all that random either -- he's good friends with Blake's hubby, and they're in this new obscure movie that's coming out next year -- something called 'Deadpool 3,' apparently./nAnyway ... Taylor's appearance is no surprise -- we'd been hearing all week that she'd be here, and they were telegraphing as much by being within a stone's throw of each other earlier this weekend./nWe'll see how much of Taylor gets shown throughout the broadcast. FOX kept it mostly focused on the game last week -- but seeing how much of a rating bonanza her mere presence turned out to be ... ya gotta figure NBC will cut to her at least a few times today./nIf today/tonight turns out to be as eventful as last week's Kansas City outing ... we're in for a whole lot of news. Travis and Taylor were all anyone talked about -- and now that they're showing PDA in public, it's safe to assume we might see even more of it in the near future./nSome might've thought this was all BS at first, but it's sure looking more real by the day. There were reports that Travis even swung by Taylor's NYC apartment before the game -- so yeah, he's been in her quarters now ... and all signs point to this being an intimate thing./nWith Swifties and NFL'ers all flocking for the show ... it's a classic case of worlds colliding./nTrayvis is officially on ... and kickoff is just minutes away!!!/nOriginally Published -- 5:06 PM PT"

In a wonderful demonstration of hypocrisy, Kounalakis joins this call despite having just attended a Taylor Swift show herself, according to Politico./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nThis editorial board regrets this poorly thought out political stunt from Kounalakis and notes her hypocritical approach to politics.

    "content": "Billionaire (Taylor's Version): Rules, what rules? Music's new icon did it her way./nTaylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour started out as a retrospective of her nearly two decade career and a celebration of her 10 iconic albums. It has become an unprecedented financial phenomenon that has already brought in $780 million in ticket sales, on its way to becoming the highest-grossing tour of all time. And it\u2019s ushered the 33-year-old pop queen into yet another new era: she is now a billionaire and the first musician to make the ranks solely based on her songs and performances. According to Forbes estimates, she is worth more than $1.1 billion, up $360 million from June when Swift ranked no. 34 among America\u2019s richest self made women./nMuch of that boost comes from her unforgettable summer. She pocketed an estimated $190 million after taxes from the first leg of the Eras tour and another $35 million from the first two weeks of screenings of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour movie. Altogether more than $500 million of Swift\u2019s fortune is cash earned from music royalties and touring. Another $500 million is based on the rising value of her music catalog, and she has $125 million in real estate including six homes and a $10 million private plane./nRepresentatives for Swift did not answer Forbes\u2019 multiple requests for comment./nHer rise comes amid a boom for celebrity billionaires. She is the 15th celebrity in Forbes\u2019 rankings to earn the billionaire moniker, and the ninth to do so in the last three years. She is also one of just four musicians to have officially achieved that status. But unlike her superstar colleagues, Swift doesn\u2019t have a profitable side-hustle boosting her net worth. Jay-Z\u2019s music didn\u2019t solely propel him to billionaire status, it was his two booze brands, Armand de Brignac and D\u2019usse, and his investments in companies like Uber. Similarly, Rihanna became a billionaire thanks to the success of her companies Fenty Beauty, a joint venture with luxury powerhouse LVMH, and her lingerie line Savage X Fenty. And while years on the road contributed significantly to the late Jimmy Buffett\u2019s net worth, his Margaritaville Holdings empire, alcohol lines and investment in Berkshire Hathaway led Forbes to declare him a billionaire in April before his September death./nThat puts Swift in a class with legends like Bruce Springsteen. His lifetime pre-tax earnings are over $1 billion, the majority of which was earned on the road touring./nSwift and Springsteen have another thing in common: the value of their catalogs. In 2021, The Boss sold his masters and publishing rights for his songwriting and recorded music for nearly $500 million, sources told Forbes at the time. Swift\u2019s catalog is now worth roughly the same, sources tell Forbes. /nHer master recordings\u2014her first six albums\u2014were famously scooped up in 2019 by Scooter Braun and later sold to Shamrock Capital for $300 million, which Swift claims was done behind her back. The pop singer famously took back control of her music shortly after that. Following a bitter public dispute, Swift got her revenge, signing a lucrative distribution deal with Universal Music Group that gave her complete ownership and full economic interest in both the songwriting and the recordings. She has since released four new albums and re-recorded versions of four albums that were part of the Shamrock sale, including 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) that was released at midnight on Friday./nHer catalog \u201cis a testament to the exceptional reach and impact an artist can achieve. Her music not only transcends borders but also defies the challenges faced by creatives in the streaming era,\u201d Alex Heiche, the founder and CEO of Sound Royalties, tells Forbes./nSwift\u2019s numbers don\u2019t lie: since she released her 2019 album Lover\u2014her first under her deal with UMG, \u200b\u200bher U.S. album sales including track sale and streaming equivalents have totaled 37.3 million, according to data provided to Forbes by Luminate. \u201cGiven [her] sustained music industry dominance and her transformation into a global brand, it's evident that the catalog's value has substantially appreciated,\u201d says Heiche, who notes that her original six-album master catalog was valued at $140 million by Braun's team just five years ago./nNotably, Swift wrote nearly all of her top 50 Billboard chart hits\u2014she\u2019s the sole writer on over one-fourth of them\u2014boosting her share of the publishing pot significantly. Of course, she shares credits with frequent collaborators like Jack Antonoff and Max Martin, who would receive a portion of any hypothetical sale./nThe pop superstar couldn\u2019t have done it without the Swifties, her uber faithful fans. \u201cYou\u2019re like a main character in why this tour is so special,\u201d she gushed at her movie\u2019s premiere. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t thank you enough for that.\u201d She gave them a shoutout in the trailer, too./n\u201cThis has been the most extraordinary experience of my entire life.\u201d/n"

Cook for \u201c9-ish\u201d minutes (love you, Taylor, but no recipe should have an \u201c-ish\u201d; exactly nine minutes will do)/nOnce the cookies have finished baking, mix together the powdered sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and eggnog in a bowl and spread the icing on top. Add an extra dash of cinnamon, and you\u2019re all set. If it all goes well, they\u2019ll look like they do here.

(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)/nTaylor Swift is bound to be one of the most-nominated artists at the 2024 Grammys. She may very well earn more nods than anyone else this time around, though nothing is certain until the list of potential winners is called out in a few months. The singer has a lot of music eligible, and she could compete in more than a dozen categories. If she ends up in one specific field, she will make history and earn another shot at finally winning the vertical./nThis time around, Swift is eligible in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance with perhaps a few tracks, but the most likely nominee of the bunch appears to be \u201cKarma.\u201d Swift re-released the Midnights song as a single in mid-2022, turning it from a solo endeavor into a joint affair. Rapper Ice Spice joined her on the reworking, and the pair sent it up the Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 2./nSwift will likely submit \u201cKarma\u201d for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance Grammy category, as it seems like the biggest hit that\u2019s a fit for that field. If the two earn a nomination in that field, it will mark Spice\u2019s first, as she\u2019s never been up for an award before, though she may also be one of the top nominees this year. Unlike her duet partner, Swift has been here before. In fact, \u201cKarma\u201d will mark her third time competing, if she ends up in the running./nIf Swift returns to the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance vertical again, she will tie with three other women for the most nominations in the field. A third nod will put her on the same level as Ariana Grande, Christina Aguilera, and Lady Gaga. Assuming none of them snag another chance at gold this go-around, all three females will be tied with several other men for the third-most nods in the category. They all (minus Swift) currently come in behind only Coldplay, with five, and Maroon 5, with four./nSwift may have already been up for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance twice, but she has yet to win the award. She first appeared in the category with Kendrick Lamar on \u201cBad Blood\u201d which lost to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars\u2019s \u201cUptown Funk.\u201d A few years later, she was joined by Bon Iver on \u201cExile\u201d which also competed, but that year the prize went to Gaga and Grande\u2019s \u201cRain on Me.\u201d In fact, of the three women Swift may soon tie, she\u2019s the only one to never claim this grouping, though her total count of Grammys is now into the double digits, so she\u2019s won plenty of gold already./nEligibility for the 2024 Grammys ends in about a month, in mid-September. Nominees are expected to be revealed in November, with the ceremony taking place in early 2024./n"

The two superstars sit behind only BTS, but they\u2019re not close to matching the South Korean powerhouses. BTS has charted seven leaders on the tally./nSwift first ruled the Billboard Global 200 in 2021 when her single \u201cAll Too Well (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d climbed to the summit. She returned to the throne in 2022 when \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d debuted in first place. She\u2019s doubled her total count of rulers in 2023, as both \u201cCruel Summer\u201d and \u201cIs It Over Now?\u201d have taken turns running the show./n"

[+] during the \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at Allegiant Stadium on March 24, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Ethan Miller/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nMore than four years after it was initially released, Taylor Swift's song \u201cCruel Summer\u201d has officially become the No. 1 track in America. This week, the tune bolts to the peak position on the Hot 100, Billboard's weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in America. As Swift conquers the chart once again, she claims a very special leader and makes history once again among women./n\u201cCruel Summer\u201d is Swift's milestone tenth song to hit No. 1 on the Hot 100. Looking at solo female musicians only, she is just the sixth star to accomplish this feat./nAs \u201cCruel Summer\u201d becomes her tenth No. 1, the tune helps Swift tie for the fifth-most leaders in Hot 100 history among solo females. She is now on the same level as Janet Jackson, who also managed 10 champions during her heyday./nWhen looking at all women, Mariah Carey rules, as she has thus far claimed 19 No. 1 hits on the Hot 100. Rihanna comes in second place with 14. Madonna is in third with 12. At the moment, both Jackson and Swift are only one No. 1 smash behind Whitney Houston, who collected 11 chart-toppers during her lifetime./nThis ranking changes considerably when groups and solo male artists are included as well. The Beatles continue to lead all acts, as they snagged 20 No. 1 hits on the Hot 100 in their run, which only lasted about a decade. Other names like Drake, Michael Jackson, and the Supremes are also ahead of Swift. Stevie Wonder also managed 10 No. 1s on the Hot 100, so he is currently also tied with Swift and Jackson./n\u201cCruel Summer\u201d was first released in 2019 off of Swift's pure pop album, Lover. She planned to make it an official single, but several months into the promotional cycle, the COVID-19 pandemic shut everything down and Swift stopped pushing the album./nThe track gained popularity once more after she began performing it on her The Eras Tour in mid-2023. The tune quickly surged up streaming charts, and Swift and her team released it as a very unlikely single. It only took a few weeks before the track bolted into the top 10 on the Hot 100, where it languished for months behind other, bigger hits before finally taking the crown./nThis week, \u201cCruel Summer\u201d shoots from No. 9 all the way to No. 1 on the Hot 100. It had previously topped out at No. 3, but in the past week, Drake filled much of the top 10 on the chart with songs from his new No. 1 album, For All The Dogs. Only two spaces inside the top 10 on the competitive tally were filled with non-Drake tunes, with Doja Cat and Swift managing to hold on./n"

Both the LAPD and the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department placed extra patrols on trains after a man was killed Wednesday night on the to the K (Crenshaw) Line, one station away from the Hawthorne/Lennox Station that ran one of two shuttle buses that dropped off fans at the stadium./nMetro rail lines A, B, D, E, C and K will operate late, until 2 a.m. to accommodate Swifties after the concerts, which run Aug. 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9. Since no train actually stops at SoFi, two free shuttles took passengers directly to the concert venue from a train station. One ran from the K (Crenshaw) Line\u2019s Downtown Inglewood Station. The other ran from the C Line\u2019s Hawthorne/Lennox Station. The shuttles will run 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. before each show, and for 90 minutes after the concerts./nBut the two shuttles were not full Thursday and the line to get on board the K Line at the Downtown Inglewood Station was nearly empty around 5 p.m., as extra accommodations went unneeded./nRows of security tape forming snaking lines before the shuttles became merely decorative as buses came and went with space inside to spare. A pop-up stand at one station selling TAP cards \u2014 in anticipation that there may be long lines at its three vending machines \u2014 struggled to get any traffic./nThose who did take public transit often rode early and were prepared in advance./nViridiana Gonzalez and Victoria Kravitz knew they wanted the peace of mind of riding Metro.\u00a0The pair, who have been friends and Swift fans since high school, left from Arcadia on the A Line, wanting to avoid the frustrations that might come from riding with their parents./nKravitz said the more than two-hour public transit commute wasn\u2019t a concern, and well worth it to escape the anxiety of traffic, parking, or other logistics./n\u201cWe get to get there early and enjoy the atmosphere and experience,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s better than stressing with my parents for two hours.\u201d/nMany concert-goers were being dropped off in the ride-hailing lot at SoFi. Those who beat the crowds and got there early seemed to fare better./nCeline Castaneda took a Lyft from Long Beach to SoFi that took only 40 minutes and cost her $45. She arrived shortly before 11 a.m./n\u201cI may carpool after the concert with some of the people I met,\u201d she said./nGail Gallaher of Pasadena took the A Line train from the Memorial Park Station at around 2:30 p.m after waiting more than 20 minutes./nShe planned on meeting her husband at the stadium, after he parks their car at a school that rented out parking spaces. The couple had reserved a space there ahead of time./nWhile the train connections were a bit like alphabet soup, she is a veteran Metro user and felt confident she could find her way. \u201cI am taking the A Line,\u201d she said, pausing for several seconds, \u201cto the God I don\u2019t even know I think the Expo Line, then to the K Line, then to the shuttle that will get us to SoFi.\u201d/nFor many Swifties, the concert is just part of the night out. And that\u2019s what they say makes her concerts different. Some call it a spiritual experience./n\u201cI think it will be fun,\u201d Gallaher said before she boarded her first train. \u201cOnce I get closer to the concert I am going to see other people there and that will be fun.\u201d/nMaria Gonzalez, 31, took a bus from Tijuana to Union Station on Thursday, the first leg on her journey to her first-ever Taylor Swift concert./nShe was on her phone hailing an Uber, leaning against the Metro information booth at the downtown train hub in the early afternoon./n\u201cI am very excited. I don\u2019t believe this moment is happening because it is here already,\u201d she said. She bought the tickets as part of the original sale by Ticketmaster, not through a re-sale, she said. They cost about $150 each./nHer husband, Juan Morales, 34, whom his wife said was not a big Swift fan, said he was curious to learn first-hand what has become an American phenomenon./n\u201cI want to try to understand the culture, all the fashion,\u201d said Morales. \u201cI want to see the outfits of the other girls and the people of all ages who are coming to this concert. I\u2019m also looking forward to all the lights and sounds.\u201d/nThe two carted a small suitcase on wheels out to the curb near Alameda Street. It contained Gonzalez\u2019s outfit: a sparkly, green top that mimics what Swift sometimes wears, she said./nWhen asked if the cost of the tickets, the nearly 4-hour bus ride from Mexico and the Uber to the stadium is worth it, she responded without hesitation:/n\u201cIt is worth every cent,\u201d she said. The two then quickly got into a silver Toyota Uber as the driver carefully stowed her rolling case in the trunk, then sped off./nIn my seat! Section 531!

[+] Mazur/WireImage)/nTaylor Swift may be America\u2019s favorite artist, and a pop phenomenon who has built a significant personal brand, but in a head-to-head brand battle with Amazon\nAMZN\n, the online retailer wins. That\u2019s according to the latest research from WPP BrandAsset Valuator (BAV)*, the \u201clargest, most comprehensive brand analytics platform in the world\u201d. The result is indicative of America\u2019s love affair with Amazon. So the question is: can consumer fandom for the brand influence the current FTC lawsuit, which claims Amazon wields monopolistic power?/nLet\u2019s first consider the BAV data:/n/n/nAmazon\u2019s brand power grew strongly through the pandemic. Back in 2019, Amazon didn\u2019t make the cut of BAV\u2019s Most Loved retailers. By 2020 though, the brand had vaulted over the likes of Walmart, Home Depot and Target\nTGT\n to claim the #1 position./nSo will Amazon\u2019s popularity make FTC chairperson Lina Khan\u2019s case more difficult? In her Yale Law Review Paper on \u201cAmazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox\u201d back in 2017, Khan admits that \u201ccustomers...universally seem to love the company.\u201d But that was also true of Standard Oil in the first big U.S. antitrust suit back in the early 1900\u2019s. As a history of Standard Oil stated: \u201cCompetitors disliked the company\u2019s business practices, but consumers liked the lower prices.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop the U.S. Justice Department ordering the break up of Standard Oil in 1911./nThe outcome of the Amazon case won\u2019t come down to a popularity contest. But in the words of Taylor Swift, the strength of the brand just might help Amazon \u201cShake It Off\u201d./n*Jon Bird works for VMLY&R, which is part of WPP, the world\u2019s largest marketing communications group./n"

That\u2019s impressive enough as it is, but her accomplishment is made even more astounding considering the fact that she\u2019s managed the feat with two different singles, which have taken turns running the show.

The South Korean pop band accomplished the rare showing in 2021. They first sat at No. 1 on the Hot 100 with \u201cButter,\u201d which ruled for seven weeks. The septet then traded that winner for another, as \u201cPermission to Dance\u201d debuted atop the chart. Then, after just one frame in charge, that cut stepped down, allowing \u201cButter\u201d to return to its former glory./n\u201cCruel Summer\u201d became Swift\u2019s milestone tenth No. 1 on the Hot 100 a month ago. It rose to the peak position more than four years after it was first released on her album Lover. Just as it was finally enjoying its time in the spotlight, she collected her eleventh leader on the chart with the quick win \u201cIs It Over Now?,\u201d which this week falls to No. 3./n"

Longtime NFL reporter Adam Schefter posted on the platform formerly known as Twitter that that figure represented gaining more followers \u201cthan he did following all three Super Bowls he played in combined.\u201d The next-biggest NFL gainer last week? Travis\u2019 brother Jason Kelce (137,000 added). Travis and Jason host the podcast \u201cNew Heights,\u201d which also gained a considerable boost./n/n Music /nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s rumored relationship has taken pop culture by storm. A sports writer and a Swiftie reporter sound off on what it all means./nSept. 28, 2023/nIs this the real thing, though? That is, is this real love? A fling? Or just a clever bit of synergy cooked up by savvy marketers? /nWhatever it is, it is definitely not pleasing right-wing provocateurs. Conservative author and commentator Nick Adams, who boasts of being endorsed by Donald Trump, posted on X \u201cTaylor Swift is a gold digger. Travis, GET A PRENUP!\u201d (Conservative lawyer George Conway responded to that with \u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s estimated net worth: $740 million. Kansas City Chiefs active salary cap spending 2023: $202 million.\u201d) /nAdams also, um, X\u2019d: \u201cTaylor Swift hates America \u2026 Taylor Swift loves communism. Maybe Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift would be good together.\u201d/nIt does make sense, though, that those on the right aisle should find a pairing of these two the perfect storm of antiheroes. In 2018, Swift famously stuck her neck out in a very political way to object to Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn and later supported Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race (chronicled in the documentary \u201cMiss Americana\u201d). She has also said Trump \u201cthinks this is an autocracy,\u201d along with other opinions sure to rankle those who are rankled by such things./nKelce isn\u2019t known for overt political statements, but he has done the next worst things in the eyes of some by making ads for Bud Light and promoting the COVID vaccine./nRight-wing commenter Tomi Lahren decried Swift\u2019s \u201cleftie, liberal, braindead political opinions\u201d and wished the two luck \u201cnot with their relationship per se but rather myocarditis\u201d (In 2022, the National Institutes of Health published a paper stating, while \u201cproving causality is a particular challenge \u2026 [a study of] more than 151 million individuals [showed] the incidence of vaccine-related myocarditis was 0.95 per 100,000 individuals\u201d)./nThat didn\u2019t stop other commentators on the right, such as Charlie Kirk, from pondering, \u201cWhat will break Kelce\u2019s heart first? The COVID shot or Taylor Swift?\u201d/nTo make matters much, much worse (to some), Swift recently encouraged her 272 million Instagram followers to vote. She linked to the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org, which reported a surge of more than 35,000 registrations following the post on National Voter Registration Day \u2014 23% more than the same day the previous year. /nThe Federalist ran an article in early September titled, \u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s Popularity Is a Sign of Societal Decline.\u201d Commentator Ron Filipkowski responded, \u201cI urge all Republicans to continue to poke the angry hornets nest of the Swifties.\u201d /n/nBut none of this seems to be fazing Swift herself, whose fandom keeps chugging right along. Her soon-to-release \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d concert movie crushed one-day advance sales records (when she couldn\u2019t strike a distribution deal with major studios, she worked out Taylor\u2019s version of one directly with AMC and Cinemark \u2014 and now the movie has seen its run already extended and expanded significantly, with Swift set to split as much as 57% of earnings with distributors). /nMeanwhile, the rerecorded \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d of one of her most popular albums, 2014\u2019s \u201c1989,\u201d is set to drop Oct. 27, and the Chiefs are currently atop their division. Whether there\u2019s an actual romance here, or just a friendship, or a marketing ploy, Swift and Kelce seem to be doing just fine./nPerhaps their critics would be best advised to shake it off before they have to look what they make them (and their legions of fans) do next November./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

You needed more?/nOn the heels of Taylor 105.1 HD3, in which one of the HD radio streams tied to Go Country 105 plays nothing but Taylor Swift (you need a special HD radio to hear it; new cars often have them), came word that KIIS-FM joined the trend \u2013 though not quite as all-in./nScheduled for August 3-9 \u2014 so depending on when you read this it may already be over \u2014 KIIS-FM became \u201cSWFT-FM,\u201d playing at least four Swift songs an hour. Last weekend included classic Taylor hits, Monday was Merch-Monday in which listeners could win official Swift memorabilia, Tuesday was Taylor TWOsday \u2014 back-to-back Swift songs \u2014 and much more./nEven morning man Ryan Seacrest got into the act giving way a pair of tickets for the final show on August 9th./nNot to be outdone, Alt 98.7 was doing an \u201canything but Swift\u201d promotion. Different strokes./nStunt work/nWhile 105.1 HD3 continues to play all Swift through the end of the month, rumors are circulating about what will happen when the stunt is done. I originally assumed that the format would revert to the Adult Standards format that focused on Frank Sinatra and friends, but there is word on the street that something new might be coming. And you know what happens when one assumes./nHD radio signals are a tough sell, as the reach is limited compared with regular FM signals, due to a far lower number of HD radios in the hands of consumers as well as reception problems\u00a0 \u2014 dropouts \u2014 when the signal isn\u2019t pristine. That can often be made up by the use of smartphone apps and smart speakers \u2026 unfortunately adding more costs, such as music streaming license fees and costs associated with computers. As most HD signals have few to no commercials or sponsorships, it is most definitely a labor of love for owners who truly try to make a go of it./nCould the right format combined with the right promotion make an HD stream at least break even, if not profitable? That\u2019s your question of the week: If you could program an HD stream, such as 105.1 HD3, what would you put on it and why? For extra credit, how might you promote the station to not only attract listeners but advertisers?/nIn the meantime, I\u2019ll keep an ear to the ground to see if a new format will indeed be replacing All-Taylor./nNot Quite/n\u201cIn a significant change for Los Angeles radio listeners, KNX has stopped simulcasting its broadcasts on 1070 AM, a frequency it had occupied for over a century,\u201d read the story posted at newsbreak.com. \u201cThe shift comes about a year and a half after KNX moved its main broadcast to 97.1 FM.\u201d The story \u2014 no longer available online \u2014 went on to state that listeners were shocked when they tuned in to 1070 AM and didn\u2019t hear the normal news format./nFirst, don\u2019t panic./nA reader of this very column sent me the posting; at first, I just assumed that management made a decision that was, um, questionable. Most people I know still tune to KNX on the AM band due to its significantly stronger signal, even if the fidelity on most radios is not quite as good. \u201cStupid,\u201d I responded./nBut then I tuned in to hear it for myself. Same news as always, an exact simulcast as has been happening for the past year. That\u2019s odd\u2026/nSoon KNX management responded directly to the story: \u201cHi there, Alex Silverman here, Director of News & Programming at KNX News,\u201d said the social media post. \u201cJust want to clarify: we have not ended the simulcast. KNX News is still on both 97.1 FM and 1070 AM in all hours except weekend mornings (Sat 6-11a and Sun 6-8a), when 1070 AM airs some paid and specialty programming./n\u201cThis has been the case for more than a year, and there has been no change recently. During those hours the news is available on 97.1 FM as well as the Audacy app and by asking your smart speaker to \u2018play KNX News.\u2019\u201d/nSo what happened? AI, or artificial intelligence, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing. According to sources close to the subject, it was a story written primarily by artificial intelligence, and I will go out on a limb and state that the AI system involved probably just picked up a discussion by people related to the weekend morning paid programming. In the beginning of the simulcast, I am sure there were listeners surprised/shocked/etc. to hear something other than news in those time blocks. But weekend mornings do not translate to all the time./nLuckily for you, we don\u2019t use AI here. In fact, I try to avoid all intelligence, not just artificial. Just ask my editor; he\u2019ll agree completely./nFuture Series/nI am planning to start a feature on stations that don\u2019t exist anymore. And not just the big ones. Stations like the original KDAY when it played top-40 and rock. Magic Oldies Radio K-WOW. KBLA. Stations you loved, but were not necessarily the stations that made it big./nI can use your help on this \u2026 if you have ideas for stations \u2014 and the personalities involved \u2014 to cover, send them my way./nRichard\u00a0Wagoner\u00a0is a San Pedro freelance columnist covering\u00a0radio\u00a0in Southern California.

Now, the tune reaches a special milestone, becoming a somewhat surprisingly important win for the star./n\u201cAnti-Hero\u201d is up slightly on the Hot 100 this week, rising to No. 20. The single has been present on the ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S. for 50 weeks, as of this frame, which is a rare sight, and one she\u2019s only managed twice before./nAs of this week, \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d is now tied as Swift\u2019s longest-charting song on the Hot 100. It shares this honor with both \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d and \u201cShake It Off,\u201d which also held on for 50 weeks before disappearing./nWhen it debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in 2022, few could have predicted that \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d would go on to spend 50 weeks on the chart...and counting. The tune is still living inside the top 20, so it could conceivably break with both \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d and \u201cShake It Off\u201d in just a few days and become her longest-charting hit yet./nIn at least this respect, \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d has become not just one of Swift\u2019s biggest and sturdiest hit singles, but one of her most important. Its success shows that the singer can continue to change up the style of music she makes and still land a monster smash. \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d proved her talents as a songwriter once again, as well as her widespread appeal./nNo tune spends 50 weeks on the Hot 100 without earning love from seemingly every demographic in America, based on how the chart is compiled, and nearly a year on the ranking is an indisputable sign that it is not just liked, but beloved./nIn some ways, \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d is an unlikely hit, and the fact that it\u2019s performed just as well, if not better (soon enough) than decade-defining tracks like \u201cShake It Off\u201d and \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d is a true testament to Swift\u2019s power and talent. Its success shows that she can do anything in music, and that she may be able to score more odd smashes in the future by taking risks and mixing things up, which typically goes against common sense and typical practice in the music industry\u2026unless, of course, the conversation is about Swift./n"

Early predictions suggest that these contenders are all closely matched, and the final rankings could be swayed by various factors in the days ahead./nZach Bryan, another relatively new artist, seems poised to collect only a No. 1 album but also a No. 1 song on the Hot 100. The singer-songwriter has experienced an incredible surge in popularity over the past year, and his new music could propel him to an unexpected victory. His collaboration with Kacey Musgraves on the single \"I Remember Everything\" is garnering substantial attention from his just-released self-titled album, and he track's strong performance might lead to a debut champion for both artists./nCountry musician Luke Combs is also vying for his first No. 1 on the Hot 100, albeit not with a new release. His rendition of Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\" has lingered at No. 2 on the chart, repeatedly falling just short of the top spot. Combs is pulling out all the stops to drive the song to its peak, but so far, it has faced stiff competition from other viral hits./nTaylor Swift's current single, \"Cruel Summer,\" shouldn't be dismissed, even as its momentum wanes. The pop track, taken from her 2019 album Lover, rapidly climbed into the Hot 100's top 10 after its official release. Fans are hoping for another chart-topping success for Swift, and if she can rekindle interest, increase streaming and sales, there's a possibility that the song could conquer the tally./nAnticipation is building around Doja Cat's forthcoming album Scarlet, which she states is now done. The latest single from the album, \"Paint The Town Red,\" has garnered tremendous attention in a short span of time. While it was released not long ago, it's swiftly become a massive hit for the rapper and singer./nThis week, the single bolts into the Hot 100\u2019s top 10, reaching a new high of No. 5 in only its third week on the ranking. With its rapidly growing popularity and ascent up the charts, it stands a good chance of clinching the No. 1 spot in the near future. While Cat has reached No. 1 before, it's worth noting that this potential victory would be on her own merit./nPresently, all five of these singles are bona fide contenders for the No. 1 position on the Hot 100. While one track may currently lead the race, various factors could shift the balance in the upcoming days, and it\u2019s really anybody's race at the moment. A fierce competition is unfolding as these stars strive to outshine each other and ascend the throne atop the most significant songs chart in the U.S./n"

    "content": "Welcome to the Wide Shot, a newsletter about the business of entertainment. Sign up here to get it in your inbox./nThe official numbers for Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour movie are in, and they\u2019re big. Just not quite as big as previously thought. The two-hour, 48-minute documentary\u2019s box office tally came in at $92.8 million from the U.S. and Canada through Sunday, compared to the $95 million to $97 million estimated earlier. /nThat\u2019s still enough to make \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d the highest-grossing concert film ever domestically, not adjusting for inflation, though not the biggest October opening weekend (that title still belongs to \u201cJoker,\u201d with its $96 million domestic debut four years ago). Swift topped the entire $73-million run of \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never\u201d  to become the  concert doc record-holder.  /nSome analysts had expected a much bigger number from \u201cEras,\u201d given the multigenerational appeal of the concert tour. One prognosticator put out an especially bold projection of $150 million. /nThe overwhelming T-Swift hype sweeping the country is  partly to blame for those inflated expectations. /nStrong early presales numbers got the industry too excited. Advance sales accounted for 60% of the opening-weekend revenue, according to EntTelligence, compared with about 40% for most other giant blockbusters. That and the fact that the audience skewed heavily female likely threw off distribution execs\u2019 statistical modeling going into the weekend. Prerelease box office tracking is unreliable enough as it is. /nNotwithstanding the business\u2019 money goggles, a weekend finish of $93 million \u2014 $123.5 million including international sales \u2014 is an impressive feat, considering hardly anyone knew the film existed until Swift announced it to her enormous following on Aug. 31. /nSwift eschewed the typical Hollywood system by dealing directly with the world\u2019s largest theater chain, AMC Entertainment, to release the picture. AMC allowed other exhibitors to show the film as well by working with \u201cRRR\u201d distributor Variance Films. Theater operators, amid a shortage of movies from studios, have advocated for alternative programming \u201cevents\u201d that draw infrequent moviegoers. Swift\u2019s film is that on a giant scale. /nThe unusual arrangement certainly benefited Swift. About 57% of the box office goes to Swift and AMC\u2019s distribution fee (mostly Swift), with the remaining 43% landing in theaters\u2019 coffers, whereas ticket sales typically are split roughly 50-50 between the studios and the exhibitors. Not a bad take for Swift, on top of what she made from the Eras Tour itself, which is projected to clear more than $1 billion in grosses. /nAMC scored from its deal as well, with its theaters accounting for 40.5% of the domestic total (its market share is normally 22% to 25%). Only a few of the top 100 theaters for the title were not in AMC\u2019s circuit. /nThe Swift pact was yet another eye-catching move for \u201cmeme stock\u201d AMC and its quirky chief executive, Adam Aron, who previously made waves by promoting NFTs and investing in a literal goldmine, and this year courted controversy among investors for its stock-conversion plan. (Last week, he used X, formerly Twitter, to disclose that he was targeted by an extortion plot.)/nWhether there are any lessons to learn from the weekend is hard to say. Having an actual studio involved would\u2019ve meant a more traditional marketing push for \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d whereas Swift\u2019s was more social media-based. Would a broader promotional campaign have increased business, particularly among those not in the target demographic? /nWith the Eras Tour movie, Swift created one of the few products on Earth that requires hardly any marketing. At this point, consumers know whether or not they\u2019re interested in seeing three hours of the \u201cCruel Summer\u201d singer on the big screen. It seems unlikely that a phalanx of TV spots would\u2019ve convinced many males over 35 that this was going to be the second coming of \u201cThe Last Waltz.\u201d /nIt\u2019s hard to even compare \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d to other concert films, a genre that\u2019s having a bit of a moment right now. A24\u2019s legacy release of Talking Heads\u2019 \u201cStop Making Sense,\u201d directed by Jonathan Demme, hit its target market of film devotees, music nerds and Gen X nostalgics. Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter is bringing her Renaissance tour to theaters via an agreement with AMC that\u2019s similar to Swift\u2019s. /nBut Swift has unique appeal. The NFL is using her star wattage to bring more attention to football, as if the sport needed the boost. Her and Travis Kelce\u2019s cameos on \u201cSNL\u201d generated further buzz for the show and the couple./nThanks to Instagram and TikTok, the Taylor-fication of theaters was hard to miss. /nAn influx of Swifties created a party-like atmosphere, with fans coming decked out with costumes and friendship bracelets and dancing in the auditoriums, which, as long as people came to the multiplex for that experience, doesn\u2019t seem to be a real cause for concern among people who care about in-theater decorum. Let\u2019s not let anyone\u2019s view of the cinema as a temple get in the way of someone else\u2019s good time. /n\u201cCustomers were dressed up in their shimmer and so many fun outfits,\u201d said B&B Theatres executive Brock Bagby in an email. \u201cWe had customers singing and dancing in the aisles. It was a really neat moment in time for us and our industry.\u201d/nTake a picture of the screen during Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d on the other hand, and you\u2019ll get another type of reaction. /nDisney at 100: Seven ways Walt\u2019s company forever changed entertainment.

Endeavor\u2019s Ari Emanuel spoke out at last week\u2019s Bloomberg Screentime conference about Hamas\u2019 terror attack on Israel. He also blasted CAA\u2019s leadership over Julia Ormond\u2019s lawsuit saying top agents, including co-chairman Bryan Lourd and Kevin Huvane, discouraged her from coming forward about an alleged sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein. Lourd responded, calling Emanuel \u201cincredibly performative.\u201d CAA has denied the allegations. /nCan you tell which script was written by AI?

Nothing is certain when it comes to the biggest award show in the music world, but these days, it\u2019s not smart to count against the singer-songwriter./nOf course, deciding who may win what some still consider the top prize at the Grammys\u2014while others argue that Record of the Year, which focuses on one specific track, is actually the top honor\u2014is thinking a bit too far ahead.

Both Swift\u2019s Midnights and SZA\u2019s SOS are locks for the category, and they may be the frontrunners to win as well./nPast nominees like Olivia Rodrigo, Foo Fighters and Lana Del Rey may return for another shot at glory, and they may be the second tier of nearly-confirmed nominees./nMorgan Wallen\u2019s One Thing at a Time is the biggest album of the year in America in terms of consumption, and it\u2019s hard for Grammy voters to ignore blockbusters of this size...even if some still have reservations about nominating controversial figures. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Wallen has it in the bag. The Weeknd\u2019s After Hours was a shoo-in a few years back, but eventually passed over, so anything can happen./nThe Barbie soundtrack may seem like an odd choice for an Album of the Year nomination, but it was a huge success, and it spun off a number of hits\u2014including ones by Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish that are in the running for some major Grammy love as well. Add in the massive box office figures connected to the title and a general adoration of the project, and anything\u2019s possible./nAlso Possible/nDrake & 21 Savage - Her Loss/nJon Batiste - World Music Radio \u200b/nKarol G - Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito/nLuke Combs - Gettin\u2019 Old/nMetro Boomin - Heroes and Villains/nNoah Kahan - Stick Season/nTravis Scott - Utopia/nZach Bryan - Zach Bryan/nThe nominees for the 2024 Grammy Awards will be announced on Friday, November 11./n"

[+] Movie World Premiere at AMC The Grove 14 on October 11, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by John Shearer/Getty Images for TAS)/nAt this point in her career, Taylor Swift is no stranger to success. She regularly tops the Billboard charts, her tours sell out instantly and any piece of content she releases, be it an Instagram post or a movie on Netflix\nNFLX\n, performs spectacularly well. With some level of success guaranteed, Swift is now trying new things and reaching further than ever before, and it's working brilliantly./nThe superstar currently rules the box office with her concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The movie shattered records in its debut weekend, bringing in just under $93 million in North America and $123 million globally. After just a few days, her latest concert capture is perhaps the top-grossing such film of all time, but it didn't mark the first time she had released such a project./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is just the latest in a long line of documentaries and concert films that the singer has released throughout the years. In fact, Swift has now dropped several projects that let fans in on the behind-the-scenes of her working life. She's previously doled out titles like The 1989 World Tour Live, Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour, Taylor Swift: City of Lover and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions. They all differ from one another in scope and scale, as well as what they cover, but performance is usually key./nAll of those titles quickly became available via some of the most popular streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu and Disney+. Swift is one of many superstars who has been able to pull in multi-million dollar paydays with their films, which became must-sees for not only Swifties but anyone interested in pop culture./nIt would have been incredibly easy for Swift to go the same route with Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. If she'd offered it to the top players in the business, they likely would have eagerly offered tens of millions, perhaps making it the costliest concert film of all time, at least in this realm. Swift decided to try something else this time around, and while it was a bit of a gamble, it worked out incredibly well for the Grammy winner./nInstead of taking the easy\u2014and lucrative\u2014route, Swift opted to release Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in theaters. There was no promise that her fan base would show up, or even if they did, that it would make at least as much money as she'd earn from a straight sale to a streamer. But clearly, she made the wise business move, as Swift is earning much more from this coup than her tried-and-true plan./nSwift and her team reportedly earn a little under 60% of box office grosses from Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. With the movie having already made more than $120 million, that's around $65 to $70 million going to the singer and her group. What specifically she'll take home isn't clear, but it's certainly more than the $10 million to $20 million that she might have collected from a streamer in a one-off payment./nIt's worth noting also that Swift might still sell the title to someone like Apple\nAAPL\n or Netflix later on, once it's done in theaters. While she might not earn as much in the future because the movie has already been seen by millions, at that point, it's all just extra cash to add to her massive success./n"

In 2019, the music executive Scooter Braun purchased Big Machine, Swift\u2019s old label \u2014 and with it, the original recordings for Swift\u2019s first six albums. The sale, Swift said at the time, had \u201cstripped me of my life\u2019s work.\u201d/nSince then, the back catalog has changed hands again.

(More shows are planned in the United States in fall 2024.) Swift\u2019s next shows will be in Mexico this month, with later dates in Argentina, Brazil, Japan and Europe. In total, 146 stadium dates have been booked for the Eras Tour./nAlthough Swift\u2019s box office numbers aren\u2019t publicly released, the trade publication Pollstar has estimated that Eras Tour earnings will surpass $1 billion when she gets to Singapore in March./nSwift fans \u2014 or \u201cSwifties\u201d \u2014 are known to see signs in everything Swift does or posts online, and they had speculated that she might announce her rerecording of \u201c1989\u201d on Wednesday night.

    "content": "In a summer celebrating women, entertainment-wise at least, the pay gap by gender still simmers./nWhile we flock to theaters to see \u201cBarbie,\u201d pack stadiums for Taylor Swift\u2019s music tour and stay up all hours cheering the U.S. women\u2019s national team, this bright cultural spotlight doesn\u2019t truly reflect progress at the workplace./nDespite a milestone agreement for equal pay last year for the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team, my trusty spreadsheet tells me the typical female worker clearly gets paid less than their male counterparts./nA peek inside the government\u2019s annual report on the women\u2019s wage gap compared coronavirus-chilled 2021 to 2016.\u00a0The good news for California\u2019s female workforce is that the state\u2019s job market has the sixth-smallest wage gap among the states./nThe good news for California\u2019s female workforce is that the state\u2019s job market has the sixth-smallest wage gap among the states./nWomen\u2019s median weekly wages statewide ran 88% of the men\u2019s in 2021. Nationally, a female got paid 83 cents for every $1 a man got./nSo where\u2019s the best place for female workers, looking at this compensation chasm? Women in Rhode Island earn 92% of men. That\u2019s followed by Delaware at 91% and Wisconsin at 89%. Lows? Utah and Wyoming at 75%./nOver the five years tracked, however,\u00a0California\u2019s gap narrowed by only 0.2 percentage points, ranking No. 32 and trailing the 1.3-point improvement nationally. The divide shrank in 32 states./nLeading the pack was Wisconsin, which shrank its gap by 11 points. Connecticut\u2019s gap contracted 10.4 points and Rhode Island 7.2. The lowest contractions were found in New Mexico where its gap widened by 7 points, followed by Arizona up 5.8, and Indiana up 5.1./nLet\u2019s start with job counts because the opportunity to get a paycheck is just as critical as the pay itself./nCalifornia employed the most women \u2013 5.6 million in 2021, 11% of the nation\u2019s 51 million. Next came Texas (4.5 million), Florida (3.5 million), New York (3 million), and Illinois (2 million)./nBut\u00a0California\u2019s female share of jobs was sixth-lowest at 43% vs. 45% nationally. Tops were the District of Columbia at 50%, then Mississippi at 49%, and Virginia, Delaware and Louisiana at 48%. Lows? Idaho at 41%, then Wisconsin at 42%./nOr look at women\u2019s job growth over five years. California ranked No. 29 at 3% vs. 5% nationally. Women in 41 states enjoyed gains./nTops were Utah at 23%, then Arizona at 18%, and Idaho at 17%. Lows? Hawaii saw female workers dip by 6%, then New York and Wisconsin, were off 5%./nThe pandemic business limitations varied widely across the nation in 2021. So, I also looked at the job-growth gap between women and men./nCalifornia female workers fared much better with their job growth topping men by 5.4 percentage points. That was 16th best among the states and topped the 2.9-point women\u2019s advantage nationally. Female job growth topped males in 40 states./nTops? Utah\u2019s job growth for women bested men by 18 percentage points, then came Nevada at 13, and Wyoming at 11. Lows? Wisconsin, where women fared 12 points worse, then Indiana, off 7 points, and Minnesota, off 6./nNow let\u2019s talk weekly earnings./nCalifornia ranked No. 9 at $1,020 vs. $912 nationally. Tops? D.C. at $1,565, then Massachusetts at $1,157, and Maryland at $1,134. Lows? Mississippi at $722, then Oklahoma at $738, and South Carolina and West Virginia at $756./nCalifornia women\u2019s pay rose 25% in five years, No. 8 among the states and topping 22% growth nationally./nEvery state had female pay raises, topped by D.C.\u2019s 40%, then Rhode Island at 38%, and Wisconsin at 29%. Lows? West Virginia and South Carolina at 10%, and Arizona at 12%./nAnd ponder the wage gap another way: 2016-2021 earnings improvements by gender./nCalifornia ranked No. 32 for women\u2019s raises vs. men \u2013 only 0.2 percentage points better vs. a 1.9 gap nationally. Among the states, 32 had large pay hikes for women vs. men./nTops? Wisconsin women enjoyed pay gains 16 points better than men, then Connecticut at 15 points, and Rhode Island at 11. Lows? New Mexico women trailed men by 10 points, then Arizona and Indiana with 8-point disadvantages./nWomen are clearly closing the compensation gap./nIn the entertainment world, singer Swift\u2019s tour may sell $1 billion worth of tickets \u2013 perhaps making it the music industry\u2019s largest take. \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2013 a film about women empowerment that\u2019s directed by a woman, a sad Hollywood rarity \u2013 is setting some movie industry box-office records./nAnd in everyday life,\u00a0California women seem to fare relatively well on these national yardsticks for pay and job opportunities./nTo qualify that outperformance, when these nine wage-related gradings were averaged, California ranked No. 10 among the states./nThe top five are Connecticut, Washington, Rhode Island, Virginia and Nevada. Bottom five: Alaska, New Mexico, Indiana, West Virginia and Minnesota./nOh, and California\u2019s big economic rivals? Texas was No. 9 and Florida was No. 27./nJonathan Lansner is the business columnist for the Southern California News Group. He can be reached at jlansner@scng.com"

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/n\u201cRoughing the Princess,\u201d an erotic e-book inspired by an actual relationship, veered too close to reality for many of Taylor Swift\u2019s fans./nBy Jessica Roy/nShe\u2019s a beloved blonde pop star with the initials T.S. He\u2019s a handsome N.F.L. player with a popular podcast and the initials T.K. Together, they have fused America\u2019s obsession with pop stars and athletes into a celebrity pairing so incandescent it\u2019s almost celestial./nThat\u2019s the story of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, the reigning prince and princess of American pop culture. But it\u2019s also the plot of a recent work of erotic fan fiction, which some readers \u2014 many of whom are fans of Ms. Swift \u2014 are decrying as an invasion of privacy./nIn a since-deleted TikTok video, which is still available on her Facebook page, an independent romance author who publishes under the name Ivy Smoak announced the release of a short e-book. In the video, Ms. Smoak claims to have written the novel in three days after receiving requests from readers for a \u201cspicy\u201d romance inspired by Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce\u2019s relationship. According to the trailer, the book would involve a \u201cpop star princess,\u201d a \u201cfootball superstar,\u201d a \u201csassy heroine\u201d and a \u201csecret relationship.\u201d/nOn Sept. 29, less than a week after Ms. Swift\u2019s first appearance at a Kansas City Chiefs game, Ms. Smoak published \u201cRoughing the Princess\u201d to Kindle\u2019s Direct Publishing platform, which made it available for purchase on any Kindle device and as a free download for Kindle Unlimited subscribers./nThe cover of the e-book features a cartoon image of a blonde pop star shown from behind. She is holding a microphone and wearing a red football jersey emblazoned with the number 69. While the book claims to be \u201cinspired by\u201d the real-life romance of Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce, and starts out with a disclaimer stating that \u201cany resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is purely coincidental,\u201d many readers felt that the attempt at \u201cshipping\u201d \u2014 the act of imagining or championing a relationship between celebrities \u2014 hewed too close to reality, and they flocked to Twitter, TikTok and GoodReads to denounce it as inappropriate X-rated fan fiction./nIn a review on Goodreads, a user with the screen name Isabella called the book, \u201calmost creepy\u201d in a 1-star review. \u201cif i could give this 0 stars, i would,\u201d she said. \u201ci love shipping TS/TK but this makes it weird.\u201d/nTo followers of BookTok \u2014 the nickname for TikTok\u2019s avid reader community \u2014 there is a clear distinction between books that are loosely based on real people, and those that are \u201creal person fiction,\u201d a subgenre of fan fiction in which amateur authors create unauthorized fictional stories involving real people./nMany on BookTok felt that \u201cRoughing the Princess,\u201d which borrows exact details of Mr. Kelce and Ms. Swift\u2019s biography and romance, while using nearly direct quotes from Mr. Kelce\u2019s interviews and podcasts, read more like \u201creal person fiction\u201d than an \u201cinspired by\u201d story. That fact, coupled with the book\u2019s graphic sex scenes, left many readers feeling uncomfortably voyeuristic, as if by simply reading the book they\u2019d participated in violating their favorite pop star\u2019s privacy. Devoted fans of Ms. Swift felt duped and disgusted./n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to write a fanfic and it\u2019s fine to write smut, but when you combine the two and then try to pass it off as an \u2018inspired story\u2019 when it\u2019s very obviously about two real people, that\u2019s not OK. That\u2019s not right. That\u2019s gross,\u201d said Gina Burgess, 33, a TikTok creator who lives in Florida. Ms. Burgess made a video declaring \u201cRoughing the Princess\u201d to be \u201cthe worst book I\u2019ve ever read in my entire life.\u201d/n\u201cI read a lot of other books that have smut in them and I\u2019ve never felt gross after them, but this one I did,\u201d Ms. Burgess said./nOther \u201cRoughing the Princess\u201d readers echoed this sentiment in videos posted to TikTok and Twitter./n\u201cThis is not what the girlies wanted when we said we wanted a \u2018football star meets pop star\u2019 inspired romance book,\u201d Kayla Compton, a social media manager for authors who has more than 54,000 followers on TikTok, said in a review. \u201cIt just felt like a gimmick to make some money.\u201d/nMs. Compton, 26, said that as a football fan, a Swiftie and an avid reader, she felt compelled to finish the book, even though she wanted to stop reading after the first few pages. \u201cI felt like I had to review it,\u201d Ms. Compton said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t ever do negative reviews, so the fact that I did it speaks to how much she shouldn\u2019t have written it.\u201d/nMs. Compton pointed to the book \u201cThe Playlist\u201d by Morgan Elizabeth as a good example of a \u201cspicy romance\u201d that was inspired by Ms. Swift, but isn\u2019t explicitly about her personal life./nShortly after Ms. Smoak published \u201cRoughing the Princess\u201d online, it was yanked from Amazon, and almost all mentions of it were scrubbed from Ms. Smoak\u2019s social platforms. It\u2019s unclear whether Amazon unpublished the book, or if Ms. Smoak took it down herself; it\u2019s also unclear if it was taken down as a response to reader feedback, or if there were potential legal or copyright reasons for the decision. (Ms. Smoak and representatives for Ms. Swift did not respond to requests for comment.)/nInstead of wiping the book\u2019s existence from her social media and continuing to post about unrelated subjects, some BookTok users expressed that they would have preferred for Ms. Smoak to have taken accountability for the release of \u201cRoughing the Princess\u201d and apologize./n\u201cI think she could have come out and said, \u2018Hey guys, I messed up,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Burgess. \u201cI\u2019m going to take time to examine what I should be writing and not take real events and make them into smut.\u201d/nThis isn\u2019t the first time Ms. Swift\u2019s love life has been the topic of fan fiction. Her close friendship with the model Karlie Kloss has long been a source of \u201ccelesbian\u201d fan fiction for so-called #Kaylor devotees who believe the two secretly fostered a romantic relationship. But many fans felt that Ms. Smoak\u2019s book crossed a line by including graphic conversations and sex scenes involving two characters so clearly modeled in the image of Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce, especially when Ms. Swift has been consistently vocal about how much she dislikes speculation about her love life./n\u201cIf you\u2019re writing a Kaylor book, that\u2019s not real life, you\u2019re imagining things,\u201d said Ms. Compton. She also pointed out that fan fiction is typically free, whereas copies of \u201cRoughing the Princess\u201d were on sale for $6.99. \u201cFan fiction either is written about fictional characters or, if it\u2019s about real people, it still has a large element of fiction and it\u2019s free,\u201d Ms. Compton said. \u201cWhen you write a spicy fanfic story and you\u2019re paywalling it, that\u2019s when it gets weird.\u201d/nAdvertisement"

So, capacity wise, we\u2019re good to host her.

Taylor Swift performs onstage for the opening night of \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at State Farm Stadium on March 17, 2023 in Glendale, Arizona. The city of Glendale, Arizona was ceremonially renamed to Swift City for March 17-18 in honor of The Eras Tour. (Photo by John Medina/Getty Images)/nFor those who haven\u2019t noticed, Taylor Swift is currently promoting two singles simultaneously. One of them, \"Karma,\" is from her latest album of original material, Midnights, while the other, \"Cruel Summer,\" was first made available years ago on her set Lover. It\u2019s rare to see any artist pushing a pair of cuts at the same time, but Swift\u2019s move isn\u2019t just uncommon, it may set a precedent that changes how the music industry works./nSwift\u2019s unique approach of promoting two hits at once challenges the conventional thinking in the music industry. For decades, the norm dictated that artists should release one single at a time and focus all their promotion efforts on its success./nHer current strategy of promoting two tracks at one time goes against the idea that the public needs to focus on a single track for it to succeed. The belief has been for years that promoting multiple tracks to the same people simultaneously could lead to diluted messaging and reduce the chances of a song's success, as fans and the powers that be split their focus, hurting both tunes in the process./nHer success with both \"Karma\" and \"Cruel Summer\" suggests that this traditional approach may no longer be the only viable option./nThe two songs shared space with one another inside the top 10 on the Hot 100 for several weeks recently. They also almost replaced one another atop Billboard's Pop Airplay chart, hitting No. 1 on the competitive tally just weeks apart. Scoring a pair of simultaneous top 10s on the Hot 100 is one thing, but securing two radio wins so close to one another really is rare to see./nIt must be noted that \"Karma\" and \"Cruel Summer\" are not just two singles; they come from different albums, eras and have distinct sounds. This diversity in her promo plan music accomplishes different goals, and it could be one of the reasons why her move worked. Swift's immense star power surely also played a role in her ability to pull off such a feat successfully./nArtists have charted simultaneous hits in the past, but few, if any, have done so in this manner. Some have released more than one track to different segments of the radio audience, or perhaps for one to follow up another and replace it, keeping a winning streak going. Others have charted wins as a featured act on someone else\u2019s tune and then as a star of their own production. Swift did none of these things. \u201cKarma\u201d and \u201cCruel Summer\u201d were in competition with one another on the same charts, and they both managed to succeed./nConsidering Swift's accomplishments, the music industry may witness a change in the way singles are promoted. More major artists could adopt the approach of releasing several singles simultaneously, all aimed at the same crowd at the same time. Instead of promoting different cuts in various periods or to different groups of fans (or potential fans), artists and their teams may choose to release a significant amount of music at once, considering all of it as proper singles./nThis shift may be due in part to the changes in how people consume music. They no longer need radio programmers to create a hit, as radio can now sometimes follow what\u2019s happening on TikTok and on streaming platforms like Spotify. Perhaps when a star is hot, they can count any number of smashes at one time. Or, maybe, this is the kind of thing that only Swift can get away with./n"

(Photo by Mat Hayward/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nIn recent weeks, Taylor Swift has been ascending on the Hot 100 chart with her current single, \"Cruel Summer.\" The electro-pop track has been steadily gaining ground, although its progress has recently slowed. Despite its steady rise, it has not yet secured the coveted top spot on the chart, instead remaining inside the top five./nWith new contenders vying for the highest position, Swift finds herself at a crossroads, and if she wants to give \u201cCruel Summer\u201d a chance at claiming the throne, she needs to do something really special with the tune./nPresently positioned at No. 4 on the Hot 100, \"Cruel Summer\" might experience a slight bump up in its ranking when Billboard updates the list today or tomorrow...but the odds of it reaching the very top seem slim for now. So, what can Swift do to rejuvenate interest and bolster consumption of this hit? There are a number of options on the table, including strategies she has employed successfully in the past./nOne potential idea is for Swift to release a new version of \"Cruel Summer\" as a duet with a range of musical stars, all of whom would undoubtedly be thrilled to collaborate with the superstar. This approach has been tried before, and while it has elevated the track's standing, it hasn't consistently resulted in a No. 1 position./nThe most recent example of this move is Swift's re-release of her single \"Karma\" from the album Midnights, for which she teamed up with rapper Ice Spice. That reworking, along with a music video, propelled the song to No. 2 on the Hot 100. A few years back, Swift and Shawn Mendes united their talents on a duet version of \"Lover,\" which successfully broke into the top 10./nIn the past, during her promotion of the album 1989, Swift altered the song \"Bad Blood\" by collaborating with rapper Kendrick Lamar. This collaborative effort drove the high-energy track to the No. 1 position on the Hot 100, resulting in a shared victory. Interestingly, Swift later secured the Album of the Year Grammy, in part due to the success of \u201cBad Blood,\" beating Lamar in the process./nAlternatively, Swift could choose to keep \"Cruel Summer\" as a solo endeavor while offering fans additional incentives to listen or repurchase the song. Fresh remixes, acoustic versions, live performances or other alternate recordings of the composition could all reignite interest in the single. Given that Swift has been performing the track throughout her ongoing tour, a live recording might already exist, ready to be unveiled./nShould Swift decide to re-release \"Cruel Summer\" as a duet or release new renditions of the song, her millions of fans would likely flock to streaming platforms to hear whatever she offers. Depending on the nature of these releases, fans might also consider purchasing the new versions on platforms like iTunes and Amazon\nAMZN\n./nAll collective consumption of the different iterations of \"Cruel Summer\" would contribute to its overall chart performance, as Billboard combines all versions into a single entity. If the original version of the song has begun to lose traction in terms of streams and purchases, combining its numbers with those of new editions and collaborations might be sufficient for Swift to surpass competitors like Oliver Anthony and Luke Combs./nOriginally featured on Swift's pop album Lover, \"Cruel Summer\" made its debut four years ago. It was not promoted as a single at the time, as Swift's plans were disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to a shortened promotional period. The pandemic also prevented her from touring the project, and as a result, she has integrated several tracks from the album into her ongoing The Eras Tour./nAfter months of heightened interest in the infectious tune, Swift and her label responded to fans' demands and officially released \"Cruel Summer\" as a single. The song swiftly climbed into the top 10 of the Hot 100, becoming another major win for the star./nThe question of whether Swift will endeavor to influence the charts and attain another No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 with \"Cruel Summer\" is yet to be answered by the singer herself. However, if she's inclined to do so, the time is now. As the popularity of \"Cruel Summer\" appears to be waning, any moves to reclaim its prominence need to take place while it\u2019s still at its high. If she makes major moves in the coming weeks, it might be too little, too late./n"

That makes it the most commercially successful concert film of all time, according to Comscore, which cited data from AMC Theatres. It beat out \"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,\" a 2010 film that grossed more than $73 million at the domestic box office.\u00a0/nThe Swift movie had raked in $100 million in advance ticket sales across the world, AMC Theatres said\u00a0earlier this month. It also shattered AMC's U.S. record for the highest ticket-sales revenue in a single day in under 24 hours, the company said.\u00a0/n\"Clearly we are going to be looking at an astronomical number,\" Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian told CBS MoneyWatch./nThe concert film could help revive the movie-going experience at a crucial time for the industry as the rise of at-home streaming has thrashed ticket sales and called into question the viability of the movie theater format in the digital age./nSwift's movie could dismantle the pandemic-era notion that at-home streaming would make the movie theater experience obsolete./n\"Movie theaters were counted out when the pandemic hit and a lot of people thought streaming would take over and the movie theater experience would disappear,\" Dergarabedian said. \"The Swift concert film is so welcome by the movie theater industry on so many levels, because it creates a very positive image for them.\"/nThe Swift film is also expected to drum up interest in upcoming movie releases that might not otherwise draw a lot of attention or generate buzz. Swift fans who go to theaters for \"Eras\" will lay eyes on posters for other films and view trailers from their seats just before they start singing in unison to Swift's greatest hits./n\"There is a halo effect on upcoming movies, so it's also good for studios that have films coming out in weeks and months ahead,\" Dergarabedian said.\u00a0/nIt could also more generally spur interest in the movie-going experience.\u00a0/n\"It is showing that theaters have more to bring to movie audiences than just movies in a theater,\" said Stan Ruszkowski, president of the Boxoffice company, a provider of film industry data. \"It's a place where you share an experience and watching a concert in a theater is much more fun than watching it on a couch at home on your own.\"/nAlicia Reese, a vice president and entertainment analyst for Wedbush Securities, estimated that the \"Eras\" film could gross anywhere from $100 million to $400 million in its opening weekend.\u00a0/n\"There are no comparisons. It's unprecedented, so it's really hard to estimate,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The reason for that is one, because she has such a massive built-in fan base, and two, because it's hard to estimate the number of repeat visitors who bought presale tickets for opening weekend who are going to go back the next three to four weekends.\"/nThe \"Eras\" film, part of the \"event cinema\" genre, is expected to draw crowds who don't usually\u00a0 turn up at movie theaters.\u00a0/n\"There's going to be a whole new group of people who come to the theater who haven't been in an awfully long time and will enjoy communal experience in a way they haven't before,\" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events, a distributer of event cinema content. \"A lot of times you are told to be quiet and turn your phone off. This time you'll have people dancing in the aisles singing along. It will be a great thing for event cinema.\" \u00a0/nMusic and movie industry executives will be keeping a close eye on the film's performance, and depending on its success, will seek to replicate the format many times over./nA recent writer's strike, and ongoing actor's strike have halted production and could lead to a gap in new television and movie releases next summer.\u00a0/n\"Studios and theaters will look to alternative content to do that,\" Reese said.\u00a0/nThat could include concert movies or recorded comedy shows, which typically debut on streaming platforms like HBO and Netflix.\u00a0/n\"But why not movie theaters? They are definitely a possibility,\" Reese said./nMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

(Photo by Drew A. Kelley, Contributing Photographer)\n/n/nI\u2019ve witnessed my longtime friend Lori Totten, of Brea, and her soon-to-be 19-year-old daughter Tiffany go to extraordinary lengths to join the millions of fans that scored tickets to see Swift out on her The Eras Tour. I was with Lori on a trip to Boston in 2019, sitting at an Italian restaurant and waiting for our dinner, when she manically tried to purchase tickets on her phone to Swift\u2019s Lover Fest, the ill-fated 2020 outing in support of Swift\u2019s seventh studio album, \u201cLover.\u201d That would have played off as the first big concert at the all-new SoFi Stadium that year had it not been for the COVID-19 pandemic./nI just also happened to be with her and two of our girlfriends on a trip to Big Bear when Swift dropped her latest album, \u201cMidnights,\u201d last year. We stayed up to listen to the album through and through in our cozy cabin as the clock struck midnight./nWhen The Eras Tour went on sale last year and the overwhelming amount of fans crashed the Ticketmaster website, Lori and her longtime friend Andrea Ramos of Yorba Linda were both frantically attempting to score tickets to any and every show. By some divine stroke of luck \u2014 and hours and hours with no bathroom breaks \u2014 Ramos was able to pick up tickets for the Totten ladies, herself, and her 18-year-old daughter Emma, to Swift\u2019s concert on May 5 in Nashville, Tennessee. After more stress and haggling, the two now-very-savvy ticket-buying women were finally able to secure tickets to a show closer to home and bought passes to see Swift at SoFi Stadium on the first night of the tour on Thursday, Aug. 3, too. The Totten\u2019s are also going to the shows on Aug. 7-9 and Ramos women are headed to Aug. 7 and 9, too./nSo why all of the trouble and headaches just to see this one artist on tour?/nI joined Lori, Andrea, Tiffany and Emma on their ride to see Swift in Inglewood on Aug. 3 to find out that it wasn\u2019t just about the music, there was much more to it./n\u201cI just love what a phenomenal role model Taylor is for my kid,\u201d Andrea said as we cruised down the 91 Freeway on the way to the show. \u201cWhen \u2018Reputation\u2019 came out, Emma started having a stronger voice. It\u2019s like \u2018Reputation\u2019 released Emma. Not to mention Taylor is just kind, generous and a great businesswoman.\u201d/nEmma and Tiffany have known each other since about the age of three and grew up dancing competitively \u2014 even one year dressing up as Swifties with blonde bob wigs and dancing to Swift\u2019s music./n\u201cAw, we are each other\u2019s longest friend,\u201d Emma realizes as the two, who are cozied in the back of the vehicle adjusting their \u201cFolklore\u201d and \u201cMidnights\u201d themed outfits and pondering aloud which secret songs Swift will play later that evening. (Spoiler alert: It was \u201cMaroon\u201d and \u201cI Can See You (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d.)/n\u201cI have a bracelet that says \u2018I heart Mama Swift\u2019 and I just think Taylor\u2019s mom has to be such a great person to have raised such a great daughter,\u201d Andrea said, referring to Swift\u2019s mother, also named Andrea, who has become a rock star herself at her daughter\u2019s shows, as she walks the venues to meet fans./n\u201cI mean, the two of us are raising daughters, too, and it\u2019s not easy,\u201d she added./nI asked the young women why they liked Swift\u2019s music and was met with a loud \u201cPffttt\u201d and a laugh from Emma, the kind of response only a teenager could deliver without uttering, \u201cDuh! My mom\u2019s friend\u201d at me./n\u201cThere are too many things, I can\u2019t even name,\u201d Tiffany offered./nAnd I very much believe she feels that way./nFor their mothers, it has become something special that they can share with their daughters./n\u201cIt\u2019s something that Tiffany and I can bond over,\u201d Lori said. \u201cShe has her music and I have mine, but this is our music. I also love that Taylor is so great with her fans and the music just makes me feel good.\u201d/nFor Andrea, this is her final summer at home with Emma for now, who is heading to Indiana State University next year. As luck would have it, the day we were headed to Inglewood, Swift announced additional dates for The Eras Tour in 2024. And she\u2019s hitting Indianapolis, not far from Emma\u2019s new college, in November./n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to get tickets,\u201d Andrea assures. \u201cI just like that I have this time with Emma. I get to experience this with her.\u201d/nLori is the first to admit she\u2019s gone a little overboard this year with The Eras Tour, especially with her outfits. Since she\u2019s going to four shows in Inglewood, she has a different outfit for each evening, all inspired by Swift\u2019s costuming in her music videos or on previous tours. She did give my friends and me a fashion show the week before of each outfit, stuff she purchased off of Poshmark and Etsy and went to work bedazzling and glittering herself to make the looks just right. She did this for herself as well as for Tiffany and she laugh-cringes when she shares the outfits for four Southern California dates and the early stop in Nashville cost over a grand. She and Tiffany also made dozens of Swiftie friendship bracelets, each one with a Swift saying and song titles or lyrics, dates and more that meant something to them./nAnd because they\u2019re both cat ladies, just like Swift, Lori made tiny little friendship bracelets for cats to give fellow cat-loving Swifties./n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how much those little beads cost,\u201d she said with a laugh./nSome may think it\u2019s insane to indulge so much in a silly little concert, but as these women put the final touches on their outfits and drew on glittery 13s on the backs of their hands (Swift\u2019s favorite number), I watched them laugh, smile, hug and at time squeal in delight as they met other Swifties on the way up to the Stadium./nIt was almost like a scene from the new \u201cBarbie\u201d movie \u2014 instead of the normal \u201cHi, Barbie!\u201d greeting inside Barbieland, it was \u201cHi, Swiftie\u201d in Taylorland. They took pictures, traded bracelets with other fans and danced to the Swift songs that were being played outside the venue in anticipation for the big event./nThey scream-cried-sang and danced through the entire show and took lots of pictures and videos to post on social media. And, of course, they picked up more merch./n\u201cIt\u2019s totally worth it,\u201d Lori said of their Eras Tour experience."

The singer occupies four spots inside the top 10 on the tally, which is a feat rarely seen. The pop icon has owned that many spaces inside the region for some time now, but this week is different./nSwift\u2019s 1989 album surges on the Billboard 200, returning to the top 10 once again. The pop project rises noticeably thanks to the announcement that the set is going to be re-recorded and re-released. During the last stop on her The Eras Tour in America (for now, at least), the singer told the audience, and thus the world, that 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) is coming soon. The re-worked version of the Grammy-winning title is expected in late October./nAs her die-hard followers prepare for 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), they are busy listening to the original. The songs on 1989 have jumped in consumption ever since her show-stopping (literally) announcement. Many of them have rocketed up the Spotify charts, and now all that listening has helped the title perform well once again./nThe set returns to the top 10 on the Billboard 200 once again, finding space inside the area for the first time in years. 1989 hasn\u2019t been seen in the highest tier on the all-encompassing ranking of the most-consumed albums in America since early 2016, according to Billboard. This week, the title shifted another 45,000 equivalent units./nSurprisingly, despite the fact that the album has been out for eight years, it didn\u2019t have far to climb. Last week, 1989 sat at No. 13 on the Billboard 200. Now, it\u2019s up to No. 9, lifting four very important spaces./nSwift almost made history in another way, as she nearly claimed half of the top 10 on the Billboard 200. The singer\u2019s other album Folklore falls out of the highest tier as 1989 advances. That title, which was another No. 1 in 2020, dips from No. 9 to No. 11. It\u2019s also beaten by fellow Swift releases Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) at No. 5, Midnights at No. 6, and Lover at No. 7./n"

[+] during \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at SoFi Stadium on August 09, 2023 in Inglewood, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nVoters have begun picking nominees for the upcoming Grammy Awards, as musicians and bands and their teams have already chosen which pieces of music to focus on, submitting what they feel will give them the best shot at nominations. These can be tough choices, especially for artists who have a lot of music that's eligible, and there are always some hits that are left out in the cold./nTaylor Swift is one such artist who had to make some difficult choices, including not submitting her single \"Cruel Summer.\" Gold Derby reports that the singer didn't give Grammy voters the option of selecting the cut, as she didn't send it to them to think over./n\"Cruel Summer\" was something of a surprise hit, and the tune isn't done on the charts yet. The song was originally released on Swift's 2019 album Lover, and it was a fan favorite from the moment the CD dropped. After Swift started playing it on her The Eras Tour for the first time earlier this year, fans rushed to stream and buy the electro tune once again, propelling it to new heights on the iTunes and Spotify charts./nSwift and her team quickly released the years-old cut as an official single. It has thus far worked its way to No. 3 on the Hot 100, and in the coming weeks, it could conceivably rise to a new high point. In fact, due to the popularity of the singer's Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour concert film, the track is making a play to lift to No. 2 or even No. 1 on the ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S./n\"Cruel Summer\" did meet Grammy eligibility, as the rules state that any song initially released in the past five years can be submitted for contention, according to the Recording Academy. While it likely could have earned some love from voters\u2014at least a nomination, if not an actual award\u2014Swift wanted to keep those picking the winners focused on her new era./nInstead of \"Cruel Summer,\" Swift submitted her single \"Anti-Hero.\" The tune served as the lead smash from her most recent album of original material, Midnights. It debuted at No. 1 and is now her longest-charting hit on the Hot 100. Swift is likely headed for another nomination in both Record and Song of the Year with the chart-topper, and she's also submitted the tune for Best Pop Solo Vocal Performance./nSwift didn't want to compete against herself\u2014either for nominations or votes\u2014so she chose between \"Anti-Hero\" and \"Cruel Summer.\" Both would have been serious contenders for the Best Pop Solo Vocal Performance Grammy, but if she focuses on only \"Anti-Hero,\" it might help voters select that tune as well when voting for bigger categories./nSwift is expected to be one of the top nominees at the award ceremony this year, and she may clean up, even collecting some honors she's never won before. The list of nominees for the 2024 Grammys will be announced on November 10./n"

Much of 1989 and Midnights is tailor-made to help you strut down the street with your head held high. Some of her bolstering tunes are on the sweeter or poignant side \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re On Your Own, Kid\u201d \u2013 while others embrace the darker sides of life. \u201cVigilante Shit\u201d is definitely the latter. /nThough we may not like to admit it, doing something bad can often feel so good. Somewhere deep inside all of us is a hankering for revenge. Swift calls upon that version of herself for this standout track from Midnights. /n[RELATED: Swiftie Runs 13.1 Miles at Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour]/nWe\u2019ve uncovered the meaning behind many of Swift\u2019s songs and, as always, there is a measure of speculation behind the meaning of \u201cVigilante Shit.\u201d Swift never reveals her secrets. Though her fans are good at cracking codes, she never confirms their theories, leaving them to be just that \u2013 theories. As far as \u201cVigilante Shit\u201d goes, there is one theory that seems to be tossed around the most. /nMany fans think \u201cVigilante Shit\u201d is a coded berate toward Scooter Braun. With Braun being public enemy No. 1 in the Swiftian universe, fans can\u2019t think of anyone else who could deserve this tongue-lashing more so than the music executive. /nYou did some bad things, but I\u2019m the worst of themSometimes I wonder which one will be your last lieThey say looks can kill and I might try/nThroughout the lyrics, Swift references \u201ccrimes\u201d against her that she feels the need to seek revenge for. Over the last few years, Swift has put an intense focus on her Taylor\u2019s Version re-recordings \u2013 an act of revenge against Braun for selling her masters out from under her. With that drama firmly on the mind of Swift and her fans, one could ostensibly guess that the retribution plan Swift is singing about in \u201cVigilante Shit\u201d could be about Braun. /nElsewhere she sings about not starting drama, but certainly finishing it, and not letting herself be sad at what has gone down, but aiming to get even. It all sounds very similar to Swift\u2019s issue with Braun. Though of course, we may never know the exact meaning behind this track, this theory seems fitting enough to be a contender. /nShe don\u2019t start it, but she can tell you how it endsDon\u2019t get sad, get evenSo on the weekendsShe don\u2019t dress for friendsLately she\u2019s been dressing for revenge/n(Photo by Tom Cooper/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nSee more/nOnly members can comment.

(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)/nFollowing Taylor Swift's announcement of a concert film from her The Eras Tour coming to theaters, Beyonc\u00e9 has also revealed plans to release a hybrid concert movie and behind-the-scenes documentary centered around her Renaissance World Tour at AMC Theaters later this year. While both projects from these music icons may appear quite similar on the surface, there is one significant difference between them./nBeyonc\u00e9's movie primarily focuses on her Renaissance World Tour, which supported her album of the same name. The full-length took the world by storm in mid-2022, and the global tour concluded on October 1. According to Variety, Beyonc\u00e9's movie is tentatively scheduled to premiere in theaters on December 1./nBy the time Beyonc\u00e9's movie hits theaters, her Renaissance World Tour will have been over for months. This means that the film won't possibly cannibalize ticket sales, as the tour has already concluded. Those who purchase movie tickets are likely to do so either because they thoroughly enjoyed the live show and want to relive the experience, or because they missed out on getting tickets to the original tour./nIn contrast, Swift's movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, has a different release strategy. It is set to arrive in theaters on October 13, ahead of Beyonc\u00e9's film and in the middle of Swift's ongoing tour./nWhile Swift is on a brief hiatus from her tour in October, she'll resume her global trek in November with performances in South America, including countries like Argentina and Brazil. The tour picks back up again in early 2024, with dates scheduled through November 2024, including a second run across America./nSwift's immense popularity suggests that she isn't concerned about her concert film affecting ticket sales for her future shows. Many of her upcoming concerts have already sold out or almost sold out, and it's unlikely that the movie will deter anyone who wanted to attend her live performances from buying a ticket./nDemand for Swift's global tour remains exceptionally high, and it is nearly impossible for anything to hinder her chances of selling out even the biggest arenas and stadiums./nA similar sentiment likely would have applied to Beyonc\u00e9 and her film. Both tours were significant pop culture moments, with millions of fans eager to attend concerts, even if they couldn't secure tickets. The main difference between the two films, apart from their likely box office appeal, is that Beyonc\u00e9's movie is arriving after the tour's conclusion, whereas Swift is comfortable using hers as a supplement to her ongoing tour, even if that move may appear counterintuitive./n"

With a wealth of eligible music, the focus will be on her album Midnights and the songs featured on it./nMidnights is expected to be a strong contender for both Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. Swift is no stranger to these categories, and her almost-assured nomination will make history. In the latter category, she's set to tie with several other acts for the most nods ever./nWhen Midnights is named as a potential winner in the Best Pop Vocal Album category, it will mark Swift's fifth time being in the running for the prize. A fifth nod will tie her with Ariana Grande, Kelly Clarkson, and Justin Timberlake for the most nominations of all time./nSwift's journey in the Best Pop Vocal Album category began in 2016 when she received her first nomination for her debut pure pop release, 1989. The title not only won in this category but also secured the coveted Album of the Year award. Subsequently, she earned nominations for Reputation, Lover and Folklore. Interestingly, while Folklore didn't win Best Pop Vocal Album, it did take home Album of the Year./nJustin Timberlake was the first artist to secure five nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album, accomplishing the feat both as a member of NSYNC and as a solo artist. NSYNC's albums No Strings Attached and Celebrity were in the running but never won. Timberlake's solo albums, including Justified, FutureSex/LoveSounds and The 20/20 Experience \u2013 The Complete Experience, were all nominated, with Justified emerging as the sole winner./nAriana Grande has seen all but her debut album earn nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album. Her releases, including My Everything, Dangerous Woman, Sweetener, Thank U, Next and Positions, all competed. To date, she has won once, for Sweetener./nKelly Clarkson is a strong contender this time around and could potentially alter this ranking. She has also been nominated five times, with her albums Breakaway, All I Ever Wanted, Stronger, Piece By Piece and Meaning of Life. Clarkson has already won twice, establishing herself as one of the most successful artists in the history of the Best Pop Vocal Album category. Clarkson is eligibile again this time around, as her new album Chemistry is a likely nominee, though it\u2019s not as certain as Swift\u2019s placement in this field./nSwift may soon join Grande, Timberlake and Clarkson as the most-nominated artists in the decades-long history of the Best Pop Vocal Album category, or she may find herself in second place behind Clarkson. The official nominees for the 2024 Grammys will be unveiled in mid-November./n"

The new lovebirds have reportedly been planning on dressing up as someone or something memorable for the upcoming holiday, including Barbie and Ken, from the big hit movie this year. A source told the outlet that the singer and football player have been ejoying the \u201cwhirlwind\u201d that\u2019s surrounded their romance./n\u201cThe whirlwind that this relationship has started is something that Taylor is familiar with, and Travis is OK with,\u201d the source shared. \u201cHe wants to get in as much time as possible with her before she embarks on her international tour.\u201d/nHeidi Klum has also said she would \u201clove\u201d to invite Taylor and Travis to her annual Halloween bash, which has been attended by many celebrities over the years. :I would love to invite them,\u201d the model told Daily Mail. \u201cIf they would just show up, I\u2019m sure no one at the door will turn them away. Unless the costume is so strong that no one recognizes them, like mine.\u201d/nAs far as Taylor and Travis\u2019 plans for Halloween night, the insider said Heidi\u2019s party is a \u201cbig option,\u201d but they aren\u2019t sure where they\u2019ll go quite yet. \u201cHeidi Klum\u2019s Halloween party is a very big option for them to attend, they haven\u2019t made it 100 percent, but since they have made things official in other ways that they have even started a relationship, they are really feeling it all out and they might want to make that night be the night they go, red carpet official,\u201d the insider explained./n\u201cThis is the relationship they put themselves into, and they are prepared to see it through and see where it goes and are looking to take advantage of everything it brings on the outside along with the personal enjoyment that comes from it,\u201d the insider added./nThe news of Taylor and Travis\u2019 possible Halloween plans comes less than a week after the \u201cMidnight Rain\u201d crooner made headlines for attending Travis\u2019 football game with the Kansas City Chiefs in Kansas City, MO. She was photographed and filmed cheering on the athlete, along with his mom, Donna Kelce, while standing in his VIP suite.

Whatever the reason, I would no more pay hundreds, never mind thousands, of dollars to see an Eras tour concert than I would shell out for Manolos or hire sherpas to pull me up Mt. Everest./n(I have just been told, by the resident 17-year-old who is reading over my shoulder, that anyone who does not appreciate the glory that is \u201cLove Story\u201d must be, in fact, heartless.)/nI was, however, very much looking forward to seeing Swift\u2019s new concert movie./n /nNot, perhaps, as much as the woman who sobbed to cameras outside the parking structure about how she has been living for this because Swift means so much to her./n /nOr the hundreds of fans who lined the red-carpeted main thoroughfare of the Grove, straining for a sight of their idol./nOr even Grove owner Rick Caruso, who strolled among the crowds immediately outside the theater, mayor of all he could see. /nStill, I have been known to sing along to \u201cMean\u201d with my daughters on the way to soccer games or do a little \u201cShake It Off\u201d twist. And I was very happy for Kansas City when Swift decided to date one of its football stars. /nProof that you don\u2019t have to be a Swiftie to understand why so many others are. /nYou don\u2019t have to be instantly transported by her every song like so many appear to be at her sold-out concerts. To admire the many stands she has taken (including calling out Scooter Braun long before everyone else fired him) or appreciate the outsize role she plays in the culture of female and artist empowerment./nA love of fringe dresses is not required to respect her work registering voters or as an LGBTQ activist. Even those not panting for the upcoming re-release of \u201c1989\u201d (which is predicted to be her biggest sales week ever) can applaud her decision to re-record her old albums so she would finally own her work, or to hand out $55 million in bonuses to crew members, including truckers. I don\u2019t own a friendship bracelet but I still bow before her ability to boost local economies and inspire childlike awe from the NFL./n Entertainment & Arts /nSince Swift was spotted watching Travis Kelce at Sunday\u2019s Chiefs game, many have wondered what it means for the NFL. But what about Kansas City?/nSept. 28, 2023/n /nEven at the world premiere she was putting in the work \u2014 and not just on the red carpet. As the 7 p.m. showtime pushed well past eight, folks were starting to fidget. Until Swift sashayed into the room, at least: Just to say hi, give a shout out to her dancers (some of whom were in the audience) and thank everyone for coming. In each of the AMC Grove\u2019s 14 theaters./n /nThis is a woman who takes her work, her success and herself seriously. And even now that is a rare and wonderful thing to behold./nAt 33, she has never abandoned her young followers or voiced, as other young stars have, a desire to move past her established fan base. Her music may have matured, but she remains committed to songs about love and the struggle for identity. She has appeared in movies and TV shows, but does not aspire to be a movie or TV star. And though she is slated to make her feature writing/directing debut for Searchlight \u2014 a logical next step after helming her own music videos \u2014 it\u2019s with the Eras tour, a journey through her own musical history, that she has established herself as one of the most popular and powerful performers of all time./nMore than anything, Taylor Swift values what she does and takes pleasure in doing it well \u2014 which has made her a beacon for everyone who wants to feel the same./n /nIt wasn\u2019t easy. White, blond, tall and thin, her looks have worked, as is so often the case with female artists, for and against her. Easily loved and easily dismissed, she benefited from being seen as \u201cthe girl next door,\u201d and was simultaneously saddled with a trope traditionally reserved for white women. In 2009, when Kanye West hijacked her acceptance speech for the MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video of the Year, she found herself, at 19, in the center of an acrimonious conversation about race in the music industry, portrayed, at best, as a victim and, at worst, a symptom of a larger problem. /nOver the years, Swift has been mocked for the often autobiographical nature of her songs \u2014 when not alluding to bad behavior by old beaux, she often pushed back against critics and producers. Her deft use of social media, the ultimate marketing tool of the 21st century, was seen as either canny or manipulative. (Um, it\u2019s marketing.)/n /nBut her habit of standing up for herself was not limited to lyrics. In 2013, after a Colorado DJ groped her during a photo op, Swift, then 23, reported it and the DJ was fired. When, two years later, he sued her for defamation, Swift countersued for battery and assault and won./nThen, in 2015, she spoke out against Apple not paying writers, artists and producers during the free three-month trial of their new music service. Some saw her as a champion, others as a spoiled millionaire star. Either way Apple began paying for the music./nAnd in 2019, Swift\u2019s battle against mega-producer Braun and the equity company that helped him acquire Big Machine Label, which owned much of her work, exposed problems that were discussed in the halls of Congress./nNot surprisingly, being the center of such wildly vacillating public opinion took its toll. When Donald Trump became president in 2016, Swift was excoriated by some for campaigning on behalf of Hilary Clinton. Lana Wilson\u2019s 2020 documentary \u201cMiss Americana\u201d captures the isolation of an artist who literally cannot leave her home without stirring up an anthill of fans (some of whom are more predatory than others) as she decides, against the advice of everyone in the room, that it\u2019s time to use her voice politically./nSo the screaming fans and sold-out concerts really aren\u2019t a surprise, any more than rapturous singing-and-dancing-in-the-aisles reception the concert film received at its premiere. /n /nIn culture increasingly bereft of role models, Swift, whose biggest scandal to date involved the overuse of her private jet, is a genuinely aspirational figure. Even the nightmare many fans faced over getting Eras tickets forced local and national politicians to begin looking into Ticketmaster\u2019s exorbitant fees./nLike her music or hate it, Taylor Swift has raised a generation of fans to take themselves seriously and fight for what they believe in./nAnd you know what? \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cYou Should Be With Me\u201d are damn good songs./nMaybe there\u2019s more than one way to be a Swiftie after all. /nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

(Photo by Raymond Hall/GC Images)/nTaylor Swift is gearing up for the highly-anticipated release of her re-recorded album, 1989 (Taylor's Version), scheduled to drop on October 27. Fans worldwide are buzzing with excitement over this project, and Swift has kicked off the campaign in style with an intriguing teaser./nIn a little over a month, Taylor Swift will unveil her re-recorded rendition of the iconic album 1989. Fans are eagerly counting down the days until its release, and the singer-songwriter has recently dropped an enticing teaser that has set social media abuzz./nOn September 19, Swift took to her social media channels to share an animated video that quickly went viral that teases some of the most anticipated tunes on her forthcoming album. The captivating clip featured a vault set against a light blue backdrop, which promptly swung open to reveal a series of letters, an exclamation point, and quotation marks./nSwift's dedicated fanbase was quick to speculate that the letters may spell out the title of one of the songs that will be labeled \"From The Vault\" on 1989 (Taylor's Version). In her re-released projects, the singer not only re-records the original tracks but also treats fans to a selection of songs that were penned and recorded during the initial album's creation but remained unreleased until now./nThese animated teasers have become a signature move for Swift with each re-recorded album, and they provide fans with hints about what to expect from the forthcoming release. While the possibilities are endless, the prevailing theory is that Swift is inviting fans to decipher one of the five new tracks set to join the 1989 (Taylor's Version) tracklist./nThe letters could potentially spell out \"Lust!\" or, for some playful fans online, \"Slut!\" However, given the song's era and target audience during its original creation, it's more likely to be the former. 1989 marked Swift's significant transition into radio-ready pop, making a track titled \"Slut!\" an improbable fit for the album's overall theme and sound...though it\u2019s certainly not impossible./nUltimately, the mystery surrounding the song's title will persist until Swift either unveils the complete tracklist for 1989 (Taylor's Version) or the album itself drops. The Grammy-winning artist has a knack for dropping hints without revealing everything, keeping her devoted fanbase engaged and eagerly awaiting every detail./n"

(Photo by Mat Hayward/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTaylor Swift's new album 1989 (Taylor's Version) has only been out for a week, but it didn't even need that long to prove its massive popularity. After only a few days, the set quickly became not just a sales success but the top title in America this year./nAccording to Billboard, 1989 (Taylor's Version) now ranks as the top-selling album in America in 2023. The title earned that honor after only five days of availability. 1989 (Taylor's Version) is not necessarily the biggest album of the year when including streaming equivalents\u2014which factor into the year-end rankings and many of the weekly Billboard charts\u2014but rather, it's the bestseller./nBillboard states that after its first five days out in the world, 1989 (Taylor's Version) hit one million copies sold in America alone. It's extremely rare for any release to actually sell one million copies in the U.S. these days, as streaming has taken over as the primary way for millions to consume music. Swift is one of a very small number of artists who can still sell albums and songs in massive quantities./n1989 (Taylor's Version) will almost surely open at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in a few days when the chart is refreshed. The set will likely beat every other title by a massive margin, perhaps a million copies or more. Once all sales and streaming equivalents are included, its opening sum could be more than 1.5 million\u2014or maybe even higher./nSwift is well on her way to collecting her thirteenth No. 1 on the Billboard 200. When 1989 (Taylor's Version) debuts in first place, the singer-songwriter will once again be tied for the third-most No. 1 albums of all time. Currently, she sits in fourth place, as Drake just passed her a few weeks ago with his latest winner, For All The Dogs. Soon, she'll advance from 12 leaders to 13\u2014her lucky number./n"

(Photo by Omar Vega/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management )/nTaylor Swift fans have been on the edge of their seats for weeks, eagerly anticipating a major announcement from the pop sensation. The speculation reached a fever pitch as the first U.S. leg of her highly anticipated The Eras Tour drew to a close. The excitement surrounding this possible and expected announcement was palpable both before and during the show, and Swift certainly did not disappoint her dedicated legion of followers./nThe final concert of her six-show streak at Los Angeles's iconic SoFi Stadium made for the perfect moment for Swift to drop a bombshell. During the show, the singer officially revealed her next musical endeavor\u2014the release of her re-recorded album, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)./nThis full-length holds a special place in Swift's discography as her first foray into the pure pop. Fans won't have to wait long to relive the magic that they first experienced a decade ago, as 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) is set to hit the shelves on October 27./nSwift playfully built up the moment before making the announcement, as she knew exactly what she was ding. Stopping the show and addressing the eagerly awaiting crowd, the star shared her excitement about the revelation she was about to make. She said that rather than simply tell everyone the news she had, she wanted to show them./nIn a dramatic display, the massive screen behind her momentarily plunged into darkness before illuminating an image that instantly became iconic for her most die-hard followers\u2014the cover art for 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) along with its much-anticipated release date./nAs the image of the album cover and street date splashed across the screen, the stadium erupted into a frenzy of cheers and screams.

And then, as the crowd's jubilation reached its peak, Swift treated them to a special acoustic rendition of the final single from the original 1989 album, \"New Romantics.\"/n1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) marks Swift's fourth re-recording venture, and it's the second one of 2023. Very recently, Swift achieved another incredible feat with the re-release of Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), which soared to the top of the Billboard 200. The set marked her third consecutive No. 1 re-recorded album on the chart, and her twelfth overall./nSwift's decision to re-record her earlier works is a strategic move to regain control over her artistic output. With the rights to her original music having changed hands multiple times, she is determined to assert ownership over her creative legacy. 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) is already bound to be another successful release, and after it, she still has two more full-lengths to re-release as well./n"

    "content": "With Swifties singing and dancing in the aisles, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d made swift work of dominating the box office this weekend, signaling a potential new era for concert movies./nFilmed in August at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood during a stop on the pop superstar\u2019s current tour, the film took in $96 million in its first four days at the domestic box office, easily crushing the competition on an otherwise sluggish weekend, according to figures released by data-measurement firm Comscore. Universal\u2019s \u201cThe Exorcist: Believer\u201d finished a distant second with $11 million for a domestic total of $44.9 million through its second weekend./nThe blockbuster opening was the highest ever for a concert film, more than tripling the $31 million earned by Miley Cyrus\u2019 \u201cBest of Both Worlds\u201d debut in 2008. More impressively, the film took in more in its first weekend than any concert film has in its entire run in the past 50 years, topping \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never,\u201d which earned a total of $73 million domestically in 2011. (The granddaddy of concert films, 1970\u2019s \u201cWoodstock,\u201d remains, for now, the most commercially successful of all time, with an inflation-adjusted box office gross of more than $270 million.) \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d  movie also stands neck-and-neck with \u201cJoker,\u201d which opened with $96.2 million in 2019, as the biggest October release of all time./nWhat makes the  picture\u2019s enormous haul even more remarkable is that six weeks ago it wasn\u2019t even on anyone\u2019s radar. Swift  announced the film\u2019s existence only on Aug. 31, forging a groundbreaking direct distribution deal with AMC Theatres under which she will reportedly earn 57% of the  movie\u2019s revenues, with AMC taking the rest. (Typically, film release dates are set months, and sometimes years, in advance, with studios and theaters splitting grosses roughly evenly.)/n Movies /nWith \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d now in theaters, we choose the concert films that redefined the form. Even at home, you\u2019ll be out of your seat, dancing./nOct. 13, 2023/nThe success of \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d comes on the heels of A24\u2019s re-release of Talking Heads\u2019 1984 classic \u201cStop Making Sense,\u201d which has grossed more than $4 million and which could herald a paradigm shift for concert movies. In recent years, such live-music fare has often hit the big screen as limited, one- or two-night events, as with the Coldplay and BTS concert films released earlier this year. In the wake of Swift\u2019s deal with AMC, Beyonc\u00e9 announced earlier this month that a film based on her \u201cRenaissance\u201d tour will hit theaters on Dec. 1 under a similar arrangement with the distributor./nFor the theater chain, which has been struggling financially in recent years, cutting out the middle man to strike an agreement directly with a mega-star like Swift can provide a much-needed boost to its bottom line. But Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore, says other musicians shouldn\u2019t necessarily start hounding their managers to try to score them the kind of deal that Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 have./n\u201cPeople keep saying, \u2018Will this now open the floodgates?\u2019 \u201d Dergarabedian says. \u201cWell, that would presume there\u2019s a deep bench of musical artists who could create this kind of demand for a concert movie. It\u2019s a great formula for success for this very unique style of release with very unique artists that operate in an orbit that very few stars do in any realm. Taylor Swift is in her own orbit and has this gravitational pull on everything else.\u201d/nIndeed, Swift is a veritable one-woman marketing machine. With just a handful of Instagram posts, she could drum up the kind of publicity it would take a studio tens of millions of dollars to generate. Merely by showing up Thursday night to cheer on her rumored boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in the team\u2019s NFL game against the Denver Broncos, Swift created several million more social-media impressions to fuel the movie\u2019s box office./nSwift\u2019s juggernaut tour is already on track to take in more than $2 billion. (By comparison, the total box office for the year is expected to land at around $9 billion.) In offering fans the chance to see her show for a fraction of the hundreds of dollars they might have to shell out to see it live, the pop superstar \u2014 who is also releasing a new album, \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d this month \u2014 is further expanding the already massive reach of the Taylor-verse. (Swift, who has acted in a handful of  movies, including the box office duds \u201cCats\u201d and \u201cAmsterdam,\u201d is also set to direct her first feature film for Searchlight Pictures from her own original script.)/nHeading into the weekend, theater owners braced themselves for Taylormania to bring out large and potentially raucous crowds. At the film\u2019s premiere Wednesday night in Los Angeles, which shut down the usually bustling outdoor mall the Grove, Swift herself was seen dancing in her seat in time with the choreographed moves on the screen. /n\u201cI\u2019ve never had this much fun in my life as I have had on the Eras tour,\u201d the singer told the crowd, which included Beyonc\u00e9, along with other celebrity Swifties like Adam Sandler, Simu Liu, Jennifer Garner and Mariska Hargitay. \u201cIt is far and away just the most electric experience of my life.\u201d/nReviews for \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d which runs nearly three hours and is focused purely on Swift\u2019s stage show, with no backstage scenes or other documentary elements, have been overwhelmingly positive. (Director Sam Wrench has helmed concert films for artists like Billie Eilish and Lizzo.) Breaking it down with Times music writer Mikael Wood,  movie critic Justin Chang wrote, \u201cAgain and again, in between private stretches of partial tune recognition, my jaw dropped at the sheer visual grandeur of the thing.\u201d/nAccording to Dergarabedian, the buzz of this summer\u2019s \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon \u2014 and in particular the flocks of young women who turned out in pink for \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2014 helped set the stage for the success of Swift\u2019s film. /n\u201cI\u2019m sure \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 was on Swift and her team\u2019s radar,\u201d Dergarabedian says. \u201cThat showed the world how the movie theater as a hub of influence can provide an exponentially stronger footprint in terms of revenue, social media and brand identification. Artists like Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 live and breathe the communal experience, and that\u2019s what the movie theater is.\u201d/nWith the theatrical business still struggling to return to its pre-pandemic health \u2014 a recovery process that has been hampered by this year\u2019s strikes in Hollywood \u2014 the success of \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d provides a much-needed shot in the arm. And for the music industry, it is certain to drive interest in finding similarly innovative, DIY ways to leverage the thrill of seeing live music on a big screen./n\u201cBelieve me, every boardroom at every major label is looking at this because of the halo effect it can bring,\u201d Dergarabedian says. \u201cMusic and movies coming together is like peanut butter and chocolate.

(Photo by John Shearer/Getty Images for MTV)/nTaylor Swift dominated the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards, earning her place as the evening's top winner. This achievement is not surprising, as she continues to establish herself as one of the most celebrated artists in the history of the awards show. Her work received recognition in nine out of the 11 categories she was nominated in, and Swift herself collected most of these prestigious awards./nShe went into the night as the most-nominated artist, and her work won in all but two of the categories it was in the running for. She tied the all-time record for the most wins in a single evening, according to MTV. Now, with 23 trophies to her name, she comes in behind only Beyonc\u00e9 for the most wins of all time./nSwift's impressive night was marked by several historic moments, underscoring her significance at the VMAs and her continual ascent above her peers in the music industry./nOne of the standout achievements of the evening was Swift's \"Anti-Hero\" being named Video of the Year. This marked the fourth time she has received this coveted award. Her previous wins in this category were for her music videos \"Bad Blood\" (featuring Kendrick Lamar) in 2015, \"You Need to Calm Down\" in 2019 and \"All Too Well: The Short Film\" in 2022. No other musician has claimed the top Video of the Year honor more than twice./nSwift is also now the first artist to win the Video of the Year category twice in a row./nThe singer took home the Best Direction trophy, as she has been directing her own music videos for some time now. She previously won the category for both \"The Man\" in 2019 and \"All Too Well: The Short Film\" in 2022. She is now just the third director to win three times in this category, following David Fincher and Spike Jonze. Of course, Swift is also the first woman to win Best Direction three times./nSwift and Fincher are the only directors who have managed to make history by winning back-to-back awards in the Best Direction category at the MTV Video Music Awards. Fincher won for directing Madonna's \"Express Yourself\" and \"Vogue,\" and Swift won for directing her own music videos \"All Too Well: The Short Film\" and now \u201cAnti-Hero.\u201d/nSpeaking of \u201cAnti-Hero,\u201d the visual was also awarded Best Pop, which is a field Swift has won before. In fact, she now claims two champions in that category, and she\u2019s just one more away from the all-time record. Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake are tied for the most wins in the best pop video category at the MTV Video Music Awards, with each having won three times./n"

[+] \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at Foro Sol on August 24, 2023 in Mexico City, Mexico. (Photo by Hector Vivas/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTaylor Swift's concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is set to hit theaters this Friday, October 13, but reports suggest that the movie has already brought the star a substantial payday...even though no one has seen it yet./nAccording to Variety, Swift and her team have likely earned approximately $60 million from the movie, looking only at the title\u2019s opening weekend numbers. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour has reportedly generated at least $100 million in ticket sales even before its theatrical release. The film has shattered several pre-sale records in the past weeks, indicating that its box office success is just beginning./nVariety notes that Swift and her team will earn about 57% of all the money generated by ticket sales. That\u2019s a higher percentage than the norm, and the discrepancy is due to Swift's decision to pursue a non-traditional rollout plan by partnering directly with AMC, a company with limited experience in film distribution, especially for a project of this magnitude. Essentially, Swift cut out the middleman, resulting in greater rewards for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour./nIt's important to note that the reported $60 million is based solely on pre-sold tickets. This figure is likely to increase significantly in the coming weeks and months as the film continues to play in theaters, attracting millions of fans. The total box office earnings will grow, as will Swift's overall earnings./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is reported to have cost between $10 and $20 million to produce, so it has already made back its production budget several times over. Even before its theatrical release, it appears that Swift has potentially earned between three to six times the film's production cost, and its profitability is only expected to increase from this point onwards./n"

    "content": "/nThe relationship between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift has been the talk of the media over the last few weeks, and things really kicked into high gear after Swift attended the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday. There has been talk about how much Kelce\u2019s jersey sales have spiked since he began dating Swift, and now there are reports saying she will attend the Chiefs\u2019 Week 4 game./nAs the Kelce-Swift relationship has taken over the news cycle, it\u2019s fair to wonder whether the relationship is real or fake./nWhat are some signals that the relationship might be a publicity stunt? Typically when athletes and entertainers are in relationships, they try to keep things more private. They don\u2019t freely admit on their podcast or show that they are dating. Photos and videos of them leaving a stadium and hanging out later don\u2019t tend to leak out so readily. /nThe initial report about them dating came from a website called The Messenger, which also had a followup story they blasted out to other media sites. How is a newcomer to the game getting these stories so easily?/nAnd when Swift was at Sunday\u2019s game, it\u2019s not like she was hidden or trying to keep things private. She was as public as possible, sitting in a luxury suite next to Kelce\u2019s mother. FOX also showed her as many times as possible, as if they were given permission \u2014 if not outright instructions \u2014 to feature her often./nThen a report came out on Wednesday saying Swift would be at Sunday night\u2019s game. That report oddly came from a sports media reporter, not a gossip website. If the news leaked out as part of relationship/gossip talk, that would seem more fitting. But the news coming from a sports media reporter seems like it\u2019s a coordinated effort between some folks involved in sports media./nBREAKING: Taylor Swift is expected to attend the @Chiefs at @nyjets game in person to support Travis Kelce, sources tell @FOS./nHer appearance could create huge TV ratings for NBC Sports' \"Sunday Night Football.\" https://t.co/GvJbzIgIyq/n\u2014 Michael McCarthy (@MMcCarthyREV) September 27, 2023/n/nIf the relationship is indeed a publicity stunt, trying to figure out how it started is a good question. Did the NFL spearhead and coordinate the efforts? Did the publicists for each respective party make it happen? Who knows, but the whole thing seems to be very carefully coordinated and is producing the intended effect./nSince Taylor Swift showed up to Sunday's Chiefs-Bears game:/n\u2022 400% spike in Travis Kelce jersey sales\u2022 Kelce's podcast ranks #1 overall on Apple\u2022 Kelce adds 383K Instagram followers\u2022 24.3M viewers watch, #1 game this week\u2022 63% jump in female viewers age 18-49\u2022 3x\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Wqtu1vgMCT/n\u2014 Front Office Sports (@FOS) September 26, 2023/n/nAnd if you\u2019re wondering why all the parties would have interest in a fake relationship, the answers are obvious. For the NFL and the Chiefs, it\u2019s increased attention and publicity. The same goes for Kelce, who will now be famous with an entirely new audience, similar to what happened with Lamar Odom when he began dating Khloe Kardashian. His career after football is now made. He and his brother have also made it clear they crave attention beyond what they do on the field when they created their podcast last year. What could be better for their post-football careers than this sort of attention?/nAnd for Swift, this further increases her popularity. And who knows? Maybe she\u2019ll even get a song or two out of this./nChristian McCaffrey has played like a well-oiled machine for the San Francisco 49ers all season long.

Her cost for the haul: $1,400./nFandom bordering on worship was evident even 36 hours before Swift was scheduled to take the stage on Thursday for the first of six sell-out shows at the lavish $5 billion stadium. Swifties, as they are called, chatted, befriended one another and waited, and waited in a queue that wrapped along District Drive all the way out to Century Boulevard./nThis is not your typical concert. This was an early peek at what will be an invasion mostly of teenagers, mothers and millennials from all parts of Southern California and beyond to see the celebrated pop star who has won 12 Grammy Awards, sold 114 million album units worldwide including 3% of the total album sales from all artists in 2022 and thereby becoming the top-selling act that year./nThe entertainment publication, Variety, estimates the concerts on Aug. 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9 will bring 420,000 people to SoFi, and those are the ones with tickets. At other concerts, non-ticketholders gather outside and sing, Tayle-gate and just party while the show plays on inside the arena./nTo handle the crush, LA Metro will keep its train lines running two hours longer than normal, until 2 a.m. to take concert-goers back home. Likewise, Metro is running two shuttle buses directly to SoFi: One from the K (Crenshaw) Line\u2019s Downtown Inglewood Station and the other from the C (Green) Line\u2019s Hawthorne/Lennox Station in the middle of the 105 Freeway. The shuttles will run 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. before each show, and for 90 minutes after the concerts./nMetro will increase the number of Metro Ambassadors at Union Station and key K, E and C Line stations, pointing the way to the correct train, bus or shuttle, said Tracy Smith, Metro spokesperson on Wednesday. Customer service teams will be at tables selling TAP cards and helping riders fund them. It costs $1.75 per ride on a Metro train or bus. The extra shuttles are free./n\u201cIt\u2019s important for all of these people to see the ease of taking Metro and say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t I think of this before and leave my car at home,\u2019 \u201d Smith said. Metro is hoping to use these special promotions as lures to attract regular riders in the future to a system many feel is unsafe./nAt other concerts in New York, New Jersey and Chicago, many Swifties rode the subways and buses, something that LA Metro has studied, she said. In the East Bay, the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority broke a record for one night of rides after Swift\u2019s concert at Levi\u2019s Stadium. The L.A. transit agency hopes the same thing happens in car-centric Los Angeles./nBut reports from other venues say the concert-goers also use ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. But these folks will pay between $100 and $200 a ride, some concert-goers reported./nUber is expecting more than 10,000 requests for each night of the concert, wrote Zahid Arab, Uber western region spokesman in an emailed response. And when Uber gets busy, prices go up./n\u201cAs is the case for most major events, dynamic pricing can go into effect during periods when demand for rides is at its highest,\u201d Arab wrote. \u201cFor the Taylor Swift concert, this means that rates could increase towards the end of the night and when she finishes performing, as a high volume of guests may be looking for rides from SoFi Stadium.\u201d/nAllie Priore, 32 of Burbank, is going to the Aug. 9 concert with friends. She checked out prices for an Uber ride and said the costs were around $125 each way. \u201cThey are upcharging. It normally doesn\u2019t cost that much.\u201d Instead, she and her friends are carpooling in one car to wait out the line of vehicles exiting the parking lot after the show./nAnd they will pay the $200 for parking at SoFi, she said, which may actually be less than if they took Uber each way, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be like real moms, bringing water and snacks,\u201d she said with a chuckle./nCeline Castaneda, 20, of Long Beach, is planning on hiring a Lyft ride Thursday morning at 8 a.m. Yes, that\u2019s right, 8 a.m. for a concert that starts at 6:30 p.m. She will join the long merchandise line as soon as she arrives, which could last several hours./nShe, too, is hoping to buy the sought-after crew-neck sweater and enjoy meeting other Swifties at her first-ever Taylor Swift concert. And she\u2019s making friendship bracelets, something Swifties embraced from a lyric of her song that says: \u201cMake the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it.\u201d/nFor related news, see: SoFi Stadium\u2019s Taylor Swift merch sale brings out the masses \u2013 a day before the shows even begin/nPriore said she\u2019ll skip the merchandise line and order from online sites instead. She\u2019s been to three Swift concerts and knows the drill. But for Castaneda, the bloom is still on the rose, despite months of effort to buy one ticket for $300./n\u201cIf I get a sweater that I buy from a Taylor Swift concert, the first concert seeing my hero, this will be like a keepsake for me,\u201d said Castaneda./nCastaneda plans on staying long after the last note of the concert is sung, perhaps dreaming of a what if scenario. \u201cI would love to meet her. If I did meet her I\u2019d probably faint.\u201d/nFor Celine Daire of Los Angeles, who waited 5 1/2 hours in line Wednesday to buy $503 worth of merchandise, she wanted to squeeze every drop of the experience out of what will be her first concert, with her sisters. \u201cIt was totally worth it. Everyone was nice and we made friends in line,\u201d she said./nFor Los Angeles, this friendship thing among strangers may seem a little more country, a tad more Midwest than independent LA. But that\u2019s changing for the next week./n\u201cFor the next six or seven nights, we will all be Swifties,\u201d said Smith./nPhotographer Brittany Murray and Staff Writer Christina Merino contributed to this story./n\u00a0"

After days of swirling rumors that Kelce and Swift are dating, Swift\u2019s appearance at the game instantly took over social media. Videos of Swift passionately cheering on Kelce\u2014in one instance, appearing to yell \u201clet\u2019s f*cking go\u201d after Kelce made a touchdown\u2014went viral. Kelce had invited Swift to the game on Thursday during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show: \u201c\"I told her that I've seen her rock a stage in Arrowhead and she might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead,\" Kelce said. After the game, Swift and Kelce were spotted driving away together in his convertible./n\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about my personal life,\u201d Kelce said through laughs in an interview with NFL Network in August after being asked about Swift. \u201cI know what you writers want to hear.

He didn\u2019t get to meet her or give her the bracelet and joked that he \u201ctook it personal,\u201d but praised the show.

The rumored relationship came under fire, both from Swift\u2019s fans and otherwise, for Healy\u2019s history of controversial comments, including remarks joking about rapper Ice Spice\u2019s ethnicity and accusations he used the Black Lives Matter movement to promote his own music.

(Photo by Mat Hayward/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTaylor Swift\u2019s upcoming concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour doesn\u2019t come out for over a month, but it\u2019s already proving to be an incredibly alluring draw at the box office. In fact, the film has reportedly already earned enough in ticket sales to more than cover its budget, weeks before it hits theaters./nAccording to Puck, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour reportedly cost somewhere between $10 and $20 million to make. It\u2019s not clear if that sum covers only the filming of the movie, which took place at her Los Angeles shows, or if it also includes marketing, distribution, and more. That\u2019s a very healthy figure for a concert doc, and it might be hard for some musicians to earn it back\u2026but not for Swift./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour sold historically well when pre-sale tickets were first made available by AMC, the theater chain carrying and distributing the film. According to Variety, which reported on claims made by AMC, the movie brought in $26 million in ticket sales in just its first three hours of its pre-sale window. So, it seems that Swift managed to make back the millions that it cost to produce the documentary of sorts within less than a quarter of a day./nAfter tickets had been available for a full day, that sum climbed even higher. Much higher. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour earned $37 million in pre-sales in just the first 24 hours fans could purchase them, reports Deadline. That\u2019s potentially more than three times the budget of the film, if it cost somewhere toward the lower end of estimates./nIndustry projections are suggesting that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour could become one of the biggest films of the year based on its opening weekend alone. The film might bring in $100 million or more in just the first few days it's in theaters. From there, the numbers grow much larger, and after its North American run is through, which could last weeks or even months, that sum could climb to $150 million or more./n"

[+] Swift' during the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival at TIFF Bell Lightbox on September 09, 2022 in Toronto, Ontario. (Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift is the queen of surprise drops and hidden messages, so any time there\u2019s the remotest of chances that something attached to the superstar might be foreshadowing what\u2019s to come, her fans jump at it and set the internet abuzz with speculation. It has only been a few weeks since the release of her latest re-recorded album, but Swifties have already clocked what might be a hint about her next project. This time, the tantalizing clue didn't come directly from the singer herself but from an unexpected source./nAs Swift's massively successful The Eras Tour continues, with her next stop being in Los Angeles, fans noticed something intriguing in a tweet from the SoFi Stadium, where she is set to headline for six nights. Shortly before she\u2019s set to begin her residency (of sorts), the venue tweeted, \"Only 3 more days until @taylorswift13. We are so excited to welcome her to Los Angeles: (Taylor's Version).\"/nWhile the message might seem simple at first glance, it's the accompanying images that have Swifties in a frenzy. The tweet included four pictures, and one of them caught the attention of eagle-eyed fans. It featured a lifeguard shack on the beach, with the numbers \"1989\" written on the wood, along with the text \"(Taylor's Version)\" below it\u2014all edited to ensure the words were clear to see./nThe significance of this image lies in the fact that 1989 is the title of one of Swift's most iconic albums, originally released in 2014. With the text \"(Taylor's Version)\" clearly indicated, it strongly suggests that 1989 might be the next album Swift chooses to re-record and re-release./nBut that's not all. Another image in the tweet depicted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, except instead of someone's name, it read \"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version).\" \"Wildest Dreams\" is one of Swift's well-known singles, and one of the top 10 hits from 1989. The fact that a re-recorded version of it could potentially appear on the as-yet-unannounced 1989 (Taylor's Version) adds even more weight to the speculation. Swift actually already released \"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)\" a while back as a one-off treat for fans, but the fact that it\u2019s being mentioned again wasn\u2019t missed by her followers./nSo far, Swift has already re-recorded and re-released three of her first six albums \u2013 Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), and Speak Now (Taylor's Version). Each of these albums has achieved considerable success, hitting No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and spawning numerous Hot 100 hits./nThis re-recording project was born out of Swift's desire to reclaim ownership of her music after the rights to her original recordings were sold away from her. Taking matters into her own hands, she aims to regain control and preserve her artistic legacy...and score some major chart wins in the process./nAs for the exact timeline for 1989 (Taylor's Version) or any other potential re-recordings, no official announcements have been made. It is evident that Swift is hard at work, not only on her new projects but also on these re-recordings. A hint like this one could possibly mean something, but when it comes to Swift, who loves a good Easter Egg, chances are it is exactly what many fans assume it means./n"

The title raked in just under $93 million in ticket sales in its first four days in theaters, making it a resounding success. But just how massive was the concert picture? Well, it didn't face any real competition, that's for sure./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour had no issue going right to No. 1 and ruling the box office, as no other title could compete with the concert film. The No. 2 movie this weekend in America was The Exorcist: Believer. The scary title earned another $11 million at the box office this weekend, according to Box Office Mojo. That's just one-eighth of what Swift's production managed./nThe Exorcist: Believer actually opened earlier than expected, as it moved to avoid competing directly with Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. After the singer announced her release date, several movies changed theirs, with this horror flick being perhaps the highest-profile to change course. Since opening on October 6, the title has earned $45 million at the box office\u2014less than half of what Swift managed in one weekend./nLooking at the top 10 highest-grossing movies this weekend in America, it becomes even clearer that Swift really owned the box office this time around. The combined grosses of the top 10 titles\u2014excluding Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u2014is just under $36 million. That's less than half of what Swift's concert movie pulled in./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour actually outsold the rest of the top 50 grossing movies in America this past weekend\u2014combined\u2014with room to spare. That list includes quite a few relatively unknown titles, such as Carlos Santana's documentary Santana ($3,171), Liam Neeson's Retribution ($3,506), as well as ongoing blockbusters that are still in theaters, like Oppenheimer ($313,755) and Barbie ($475,664)./nThe $93 million that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour earned marks the second largest debut in theaters for a movie arriving in October, according to CNBC. The singer's concert film came close to matching the all-time record, which is still held by Joker. That picture, which opened in October 2019, earned a little more than $96 million in its opening weekend./n"

Self-interested hotel union Unite Here Local 11./nFor related news, see: Politicians urge Taylor Swift to postpone LA concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers/nIn a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times, the union called on Swift to postpone her show in \u201csolidarity\u201d with striking hotel workers. Several of the union\u2019s elected allies have predictably chimed in, arguing that Swift should respect the union\u2019s cause. Lieutenant\u00a0Governor Eleni Kounalakis was shameless enough to join the protest, despite having just seen Swift in Santa Clara the weekend prior./nNotably missing from the list of boycott endorsers: Inglewood Mayor James Butts, not to mention the countless small businesses and disappointed fans who would lose out if Swift skipped SoFi./nThe union\u2019s demand is an unusual one: Swift herself is not in the middle of a labor dispute. Indeed, Swift made news in recent days by awarding her road crew up to $100,000 each as a personal thank you for the hard work during the tour. She\u2019s also partnered with local\u00a0charitable\u00a0organizations on her tour stops, such as a food bank in Santa Clara./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more pro-worker perspective,\u00a0and seemingly one that Los Angeles would welcome to town./nBut according to Local 11\u2019s twisted logic, Swift is obligated to reschedule because her visiting fans will be staying at LA-area hotels, including some of the hotels where workers may currently be on strike. This selfish perspective is on-brand for Local 11, which in recent weeks has made news for deliberately disrupting a wedding and 4th of July tourism to advance its goals during the strike./nRelated Articles\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tMatt Fleming: Thank you, readers, for reading my columns\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tGiving thanks for all of our freedoms\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tHappy Thanksgiving: Political Cartoons\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tA Thanksgiving lesson from grateful and prepared American families\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tJudge Andrew Napolitano: No one should be thankful for the size and scope of government\t\t\n\nSet aside for a minute the flawed argument that the entire LA economy should suffer because of labor disputes at a handful of union properties. The fault for the ongoing strike lies with union leadership, not the hotels and certainly not the excited Taylor fans coming to Los Angeles. The union has stubbornly prolonged the dispute with demands that hotels support a Los Angeles ballot measure that would require them to house the homeless alongside paying guests./nWith a potential transformation of these hotels into makeshift homeless shelters,\u00a0good luck getting tourists to stay there for Taylor\u2019s next tour stop in Los Angeles./nFor related news, see: Eleni Kounalakis hypocritically calls for Taylor Swift to cancel shows after attending concert/nAlso on the list of demands is a new hotel tax of seven percent, which guests would pay into a trust fund controlled by the union. The union claims the money would go towards affordable housing, but the language of the fund gives it broad latitude to spend the money on \u201cother efforts\u201d as well./nAs of this writing, Swift seems poised to ignore the union\u2019s unreasonable demands, picking the local economy and thousands of fans over the tantrums of Kurt Peterson and his cronies at Local 11. The tour dates will no doubt be a success, and should also serve as a lesson to other celebrities and politicians who face a Local 11 call for a boycott: There\u2019s no harm in shaking off the unreasonable demands of Los Angeles labor unions./nMichael Saltsman is Executive Director at the Employment Policies Institute"

    "content": "/nNew York Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner thinks Sunday may have gone a little differently if he was a \"Swiftie.\"/nGardner was called for a controversial holding call toward the end of the Chiefs' 23-20 victory over the Jets. This came with singer Taylor Swift in the audience, and her association with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has caused a crossover between the music superstar's fanbase and the NFL./nAfter the NFL changed its Instagram bio to say \"Chiefs are 2-0 as Swifties,\" Gardner responded on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, suggesting that if he were a \"Swiftie\" the call may have gone differently./nSauce Gardner on the NFL adding to their official bio: \"Chiefs Are 2-0 As Swifties\"<br><br>\"Lmaoo maybe if I was a swiftie, the ref wouldn't of threw the flag.\" <br><br>He then edited it to remove the last part.. <a href=\"https://t.co/m0yETvXEew\">https://t.co/m0yETvXEew</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dzBK2Y19sX\">pic.twitter.com/dzBK2Y19sX</a>/nGardner has since deleted the tweet./nThe contact between Gardner and Chiefs wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling seemed to be minor, but the call negated an interception from Jets cornerback Michael Carter II./nThe interception would not have ensured a Jets victory, though, as the team was trailing and would have needed to drive down the field and score. However, the offense had its best performance of the season, producing 336 yards./nThe penalty not only negated the interception but also gave the Chiefs a fresh set of downs. Kansas City did not surrender the ball back, converting one third down after the call before kneeling out the clock./nThe loss sent the Jets to 1-3 on the season and the team sits in last place in the AFC East. Still, competing with the Chiefs was a good step for the team and quarterback Zach Wilson's performance showed that he has some more capability to lead the team to victories./nThe Jets will look to rebound Sunday when they head west to take on the 1-3 Denver Broncos."

EDITORIAL USE ONLY (Photo by Mat Hayward/Getty Images for iHeartMedia)/nOlivia Rodrigo is in full album promotion mode, as she has just recently released a new single titled \u201cBad Idea, Right?\u201d from her forthcoming project Guts. The song has become another quick hit for the pop singer, who seems to always hit and rarely misses. The tune was so popular upon its arrival that it instantly became a No. 1 on a specific Billboard chart, and with another leader to her name, Rodrigo ties one of the biggest stars on the planet and makes history./n\u201cBad Idea, Right?\u201d debuts at No. 1 on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart. The Billboard tally lists the most-consumed rock and alternative tracks in the U.S. each week using a methodology that combines sales, streams, and radio play. Rodrigo\u2019s latest becomes her second champion on the ranking, and with another No. 1 to her name, she is in historic company./nRodrigo is now tied with Taylor Swift for the second-most No. 1 hits in the history of the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart among women. The two stars have both accrued a pair of winners, and only Billie Eilish is in front of them. The young Grammy winner recently broke her tie with Swift by earning a third No. 1 on the chart, as her Barbie soundtrack cut \u201cWhat Was I Made For?\u201d rose to the summit not long after it was released./nAmong all acts, Imagine Dragons rules, with five No. 1 smashes on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart. Behind that band comes another, as Twenty One Pilots have accrued four champions. Eilish is on the same level as a handful of other rock favorites with three No. 1s, including Foo Fighters and Linkin Park./n\u201cBad Idea, Right?\u201d is only Rodrigo\u2019s second placement on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart. That means that her record of sending tracks to the summit on the ranking is perfect, as she hasn\u2019t failed to reach the peak yet. She earned her first leader on the list two years ago with \u201cBrutal.\u201d The tune was featured on her debut album Sour./nWhile she may have only accrued a pair of hits on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart, Rodrigo has been very successful on other Billboard charts. Most of her output wasn\u2019t deemed eligible for the genre-specific tally. She has already snagged a trio of No. 1s on the Hot 100, though none of them went to the rock-only list. \u201cBad Idea, Right?\u201d debuted inside the top 10 on the Hot 100, becoming her second track from Guts to appear in the region. The album\u2019s lead single \u201cVampire\u201d opened in first place earlier this year./n"

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nNewspapers rarely assign a reporter to cover a single artist. But Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 are cultural forces whose tours continue breaking records./nBy Eduardo Medina/nGannett, the largest newspaper chain in the United States, has announced that it would hire reporters to cover two of the biggest names in music: Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9./nAmid the zeal around both artists\u2019 record-breaking tours this year, Gannett said in separate announcements on Tuesday and Wednesday that it was looking for two reporters who could capture the significance of their music, their growing legacies and the effect both women have had across the music world./nThe two reporters would be writing for USA Today and The Tennessean, the publisher\u2019s newspaper in Nashville, where Swift began her career as a country darling before selling out stadiums across North America on her record-breaking Eras Tour./nIn its job description for the Beyonc\u00e9 reporting job, Gannett said on Wednesday that it was seeking a journalist who could cover how the \u201cinternational superstar and icon\u2019s impact is felt across generations,\u201d and how she has been \u201ca force in everything from how the country views race to how women think about their partners.\u201d/nGannett said on Tuesday that the reporter covering Swift would have to \u201cidentify why the pop star\u2019s influence only expands, what her fan base stands for in pop culture.\u201d/nThe jobs reflect the frenzied fandom that has surrounded both Swift and Beyonc\u00e9, who is also currently touring across the world./nSwift\u2019s cultural resonance seems to deepen with each album, including the re-recordings of her old music. Her fans have spent thousands of dollars on concert tickets and shook the ground so hard at one concert that it registered as an earthquake on a seismometer near Seattle./nAt Beyonc\u00e9 shows, fans dress up in attire inspired by cosmic cowboys and cowgirls, filling up stadiums in silver and glittery hats and boots. They follow her subtle cues, seas of people going silent as she sings the line \u201cLook around everybody on mute,\u201d from the 2022 song \u201cEnergy,\u201d and have held up blue balloons to celebrate performances by her daughter Blue Ivy Carter. Billboard reported that her Renaissance World Tour had the biggest one-month gross in boxscore history in July./nReactions to the Swift job posting on Tuesday had been mixed, including praise for Gannett for trying to reach a new audience and criticism over how the company has laid off local journalists in recent years./nKristin Roberts, Gannett\u2019s chief content officer, said in a statement on Tuesday night that the USA Today Network, which the company owns, is committed to serving its readers with essential journalism, and that \u201cincludes providing our audience with content they crave.\u201d/n\u201cAs Taylor Swift\u2019s fan base has grown to unprecedented heights, so has the influence of her music and growing legacy \u2014 not only on the industry but on our culture,\u201d Ms. Roberts said. \u201cShe is shaping a generation and is relevant, influential and innovative \u2014 just like us.\u201d/nNewspapers often employ music critics and entertainment reporters, but rarely assign a reporter to cover a single artist./nThe popularity of Swift, though, has proved to be a powerful force over the summer, culturally and economically./nA Federal Reserve survey of business contacts reported that Swift fans, or Swifties, had bolstered hotel revenues in the Philadelphia region. Although Swift, 33, and her promoters do not publicly report box-office figures, the trade publication Pollstar estimates that she has been selling about $14 million in tickets each night. By the end of her planned world tour, which is booked with 146 stadium dates well into 2024, Swift\u2019s sales could reach $1.4 billion or more \u2014 exceeding Elton John\u2019s $939 million for his multiyear farewell tour, the current record-holder./nSome journalists expressed concern about Gannett\u2019s reporting priorities. Last December, Gannett cut about 6 percent of the company\u2019s roughly 3,440-person U.S. media division. Media analysts said the move could worsen the state of the local news industry, which has shrunk in recent years, creating information deserts in communities across the country./nLaura D. Testino, a reporter for Chalkbeat Tennessee, said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that while Nashville is getting a Swift reporter, \u201cMemphis is still without an investigative reporter.\u201d/nGannett has hired 225 journalists since March and now has more than 100 open roles, Ms. Roberts said./nRobert Thompson, the director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, said on Tuesday that hiring for such specific beats \u201cis not as absurd as it looks at first glance.\u201d/nIn an increasingly fragmented cultural environment, \u201cwhere mass culture has broken up into a million little pieces,\u201d he said, there is an increased value to the one thing that emerges that essentially everyone can comment on./n\u201cYou cannot be conscious in the United States without on some level having to come to grips with Taylor Swift,\u201d Dr. Thompson said. Covering someone like her, he added, is a \u201cperfectly sound activity for a journalist to be doing.\u201d/nEduardo Medina is a reporter covering breaking news.

While the name in charge of the most competitive songs ranking in the U.S. won't change, it seems that the song that sits at No. 1 will./nAt the moment, it looks like Swift may replace herself atop the Hot 100 in just a few days. The singer currently controls Billboard's ranking of the most-consumed songs in America with her somewhat surprising smash \"Cruel Summer.\" While there's a chance that the same tune could hold on for another frame atop the list, it seems more likely that the Grammy winner will swap one hit for another./nSwift is headed for another No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with 1989 (Taylor's Version), a slightly reworked version of her original blockbuster pop record. For the re-recording, she added several new tunes to the title, and it looks like one of them may debut atop the Hot 100./nOnce 1989 (Taylor's Version) arrived, fans flocked to hear the several new songs that were written during the initial 1989 sessions but never released. Almost immediately, \"Slut!\" stood out as the most popular track from the album, perhaps based off of its eye-catching title. While that tune will likely perform well, it no longer seems to be a frontrunner for the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100. Instead, a top 10 start is highly probable./nCurrently, fellow new tune\u2014or \"From The Vault\" in Swift's speak\u2014\"Is It Over Now?\" is the presumptive ruler. The track has been selling well on iTunes since its release, but in the past day or so, it's been supplanted by a slew of Halloween hits./nThe track has been running the show on Spotify, however, and all those streams may make it an instant ruler. The cut spent four of its first five days at No. 1 on the streamer\u2019s ranking of the top-streamed tunes in the U.S., which is a great sign it\u2019s headed for a spectacular launch./nIt's very rare for an artist to replace themselves atop the Hot 100, and only a relatively small number of acts have done so. Swift is already included in that roundup, as she swapped one 1989 smash for another nearly a decade ago. Now, she's set to score another No. 1 from the title, many years later./n"

Keep showing \u2018em, show \u2018em!\u2019 Listen, you show \u2018em once, let [us] know they\u2019re there, maybe after a touchdown, you get a little clip. But you can\u2019t be overboard with it.\u201d/nThe NFL defended its coverage of Swift and Kelce\u2019s relationship in a statement Wednesday./n\u201cThe Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we\u2019ve leaned into in real time, as it\u2019s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we\u2019ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport,\u201d the league stated. \u201cThe vast majority of our content has remained focused on the game, our players and variety of other initiatives, including our Toy Story Funday Football alt-cast, the international games and more.\u201d/n Entertainment & Arts /nRachel Zegler tells people to \u2018Leave Taylor Swift\u2019 after Barstool\u2019s Dan \u2018Big Cat\u2019 Katz remarked about needing to see a sex tape of Swift and Travis Kelce to believe in their romance./nOct. 4, 2023/nOn their podcast, the Kelce brothers discussed Front Office Sports\u2019 count of 17 cutaways to Swift, Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Hugh Jackman and others enjoying the game from their suite (for perspective, the sports media tracker also counted eight cutaways to injured Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers during the broadcast)./n\u201cDamn that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Travis Kelce said of the number of times the \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d singer was shown during the game. \u201cIt\u2019s like once a drive.\u201d/nJason added: \u201cI mean, that\u2019s more than Jack Nicholson courtside for the Lakers.\u201d/nNBC was rewarded for its efforts with 27 million viewers, more than any for a Sunday night show since the Super Bowl in February.

It\u2019s hard for me to wrap my head around that sentence, but, yeah.\u201d/nJason: \u201cNot only is social media noticing it, but it appears that Big Red [Chiefs coach Andy Reid] is noticing it, because he weighed in (big laugh from Travis), that\u2019s right, in his postgame press conference ...\u201d/nTravis: \u201cLove Coach Reid, man, what a guy.\u201d/nJason: \u201c... he was asked about your big game, and his response was, \u2018Kelce keeps getting better with time, Taylor can stay around all she wants.\u201d (Big laughs from both)/n Sports /nChiefs\u2019 Travis Kelce discussed the NFL\u2019s over-the-top coverage of Taylor Swift on his podcast with brother Jason. The NFL defended it, calling it \u2018a pop cultural moment.\u2019/nOct. 5, 2023/nTravis: \u201cWhat a guy. Listen, when you\u2019re getting Big Red\u2019s approval and blessings you know you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d/nJason: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d/nTravis Kelce then quickly shifted the conversation to the game, the fans, next week\u2019s game, divisional rivalry \u2014 and all pretty much in one breath. You\u2019ll also notice that even during the discussion about the graphic, Kelce opted not to focus on the notion that Swift needs to be around for him to have a good game. /nAnd, obviously, it\u2019s a ridiculous notion. Maybe CBS was just having a little fun and trying to troll the NFL fans who have been triggered by the suggestion that Swift put Kelce \u201con the map.\u201d Sure, Swift was there the past two weeks when Kelce caught nine passes for 124 yards against the Denver Broncos and had 12 catches for 179 yards (his second-most ever) against the Chargers. But those were the 43rd and 44th times in the tight end\u2019s 11-year career (regular season and playoffs combined) that he\u2019s had 100 yards or more in a game./n Music /nTravis Kelce, who is dating Taylor Swift, has upgraded his humble Kansas City abode by reportedly buying a $6-million mansion in Kansas to get more privacy./nOct. 19, 2023/nIt should also be noted that Swift was in the VIP suite when Kelce had 69 receiving yards against Chicago and 60 against the New York Jets \u2014 not at all bad numbers, but well below the average CBS highlighted. Also, one of the games Swift did not attend was a 26-yard effort against Jacksonville in Week 2, Kelce\u2019s first game of the year after missing the opener with a knee injury. That number brings Kelce\u2019s average yardage for the two Taylor-less games way down. /nSo it seems very unlikely that Swift is a living, breathing good luck charm for a player who already was considered to be a future Hall of Famer. But he seems happy, she seems happy and Kansas City fans are definitely happy \u2014 so everybody wins!

Gracie was an opening act on Olivia Rodrigo\u2018s 2022 Sour Tour that ran from April 2022 to July 2022. Gracie told her fans that she was \u201cscreaming crying\u201d in excitement when she found out the news from Olivia. Then in 2023, Gracie opened for over a dozen shows on the first US leg of\u00a0Taylor Swift\u2018s Eras Tour./nTaylor announced on August 3, 2023 that her tour is returning to the U.S. and going to Canada in the fall with Gracie as the special guest performer. \u201cIT DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO BE OVER\ud83d\ude2d,\u201d Gracie wrote on Instagram to celebrate the news. \u201c@taylorswift I love you forever. I can\u2019t even \u2026\u2026 HAPPY ERAS,\u201d she added. Gracie will perform at Taylor\u2019s shows in Miami, New Orleans, Indianapolis, and Toronto in October 2023 and November 2023./n/nA post shared by Gracie Abrams (@gracieabrams)/n/nHollywoodLife has all the updates on Gracie Abrams below. Keep reading to learn all about the talented singer, including who her famous father is./nGracie Madigan Abrams, born Sept. 7, 1999, is an American singer-songwriter. She released her debut single, \u201cMean It,\u201d in 2019 and followed it up with \u201cStay.\u201d In 2020, she released her debut ep, Minor, which included songs, \u201cLong Sleeves,\u201d \u201cFriend,\u201d \u201cI Miss You, I\u2019m Sorry\u2019 and more. She promoted the release with appearances on late-night shows and continued to work on her career during the pandemic months. She teamed with Benny Blanco for his Friends Keep Secrets 2 album, joining him on the single, \u201cUnlearn.\u201d In 2021, she also released Mess It Up,\u201d \u201cFeels Like,\u201d and \u201cRockland,\u201d a song she wrote with Aaron Dresser (the member of The National who co-wrote and produced Taylor Swift\u2019s\u00a0folklore and evermore.)./nGracie is the daughter of J.J. Abrams and Katie McGrath. JJ is best known for directing movies like Cloverfield, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the 2009 Star Trek reboot, and more. He also has created Alias, Lost, and Fringe and had his hand in several other projects. Katie is also a producer, as she\u2019s worked with her and JJ\u2019s Bad Robots Productions company, as well as the Katie McGrath & JJ Abrams Family Foundation./n\u201cEven the slight knowledge that I had of it growing up as a kid made me want to have nothing to do with it at all,\u201d Gracie said of her parents\u2019 business in an interview with Riff Magazine. \u201cWhen I started falling in love with music independent of all other factors in my life, it was kind of a happy surprise, just because I actively tried to avoid anything that they were involved in. I\u2014with love\u2014wanted nothing to do with them.\u201d/nAt age 8, she signed up for drumming classes. She then learned piano, then guitar, finding them more conducive to her songwriting. Her protective parents only allowed her to post the music to her SoundCloud and required that she keep her Instagram private. When she made the account public, her career took off \u2013 and it led to some amazing connections. Lorde even DM\u2019d Gracie, asking for a download of one of her songs./n\u201cShe definitely is an artist in my life that I will forever feel like I owe everything to,\u201d Gracie told Riff when talking about Lorde. \u201cSonically and thematically, [Pure Heroine] changed my life. I remember being with my family in the living room, and I refresh my Instagram and see that she followed me. I had a crazy physical reaction, like, sweating immediately.\u201d/n\u201cOne of my favorite artists and one of the coolest people ever is Gracie Abrams, who just came out with her debut EP a couple of months ago,\u201d Olivia told Zane Lowe in January 2021 (per ET Canada). \u201cIt\u2019s called Minor, and she\u2019s absolutely amazing, love that entire record. She\u2019s signed to my same record label, so they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll have you meet.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I literally don\u2019t think I can meet her. I think I would just evaporate. I\u2019m her biggest fan.\u2019 I\u2019ve heard the best things, and I\u2019ve been DMing her on Instagram, and I told her that \u2018Driver\u2019s License\u2019 was so inspired by her, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s amazing.'\u201d/n\u201cThis is my bedroom songwriting oasis,\u201d Olivia Rodrigo said in a May 2021 interview with Elle. Olivia \u201ccreated a little shrine\u201d to all the \u201csinger-songwriters she admires.\u201d Among that makeshift \u2018Hall of Fame\u2019 were Taylor Swift,\u00a0Gwen Stefani,\u00a0Alanis Morissette, and, of course, Gracie Abrams.\u201d Simon Riback, the head of A&R at Interscope \u2013 part of the company that includes Geffen Records, which is Olivia\u2019s label \u2013 said he was impressed by Olivia and how she named Gracie as one of her favorite artists. \u201cGracie\u2019s in her infancy! She started referencing Fiona Apple, the Smashing Pumpkins. She liked the Taylor Swifts and all that, but you could tell there was a left-of-center view to the way she was approaching pop music.\u201d/nDuring the 2020 election, Gracie worked as a poll worker in her area, something she told NME was inspired by her friends. \u201cUnfortunately, for a really long time, younger people had assumed we would be OK in the hand of the older generation, but clearly we can\u2019t rely on them to shape the future that we want to see,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cBeing involved really mattered to me.\u201d"

(Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift is gearing up for the release of her new album, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), later this month, but the spotlight currently remains on some of her older singles as they continue to perform well on the Hot 100 chart./n\"Anti-Hero,\" Swift's 2022 Hot 100 No. 1, has now spent an impressive 49 weeks on the chart, making it one of her longest-charting tracks. It's getting tantalizingly close to becoming her longest-charting single ever on the weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S./nThe song is now tied with Swift's own \"Love Story,\" which also had a 49-week run on the Hot 100. However, \"Anti-Hero\" seems poised to surpass this record, as \u201cLove Story\u201d fell off the list before it reached an even 50 turns on the tally./nSwift has seen two other singles, \"Shake It Off\" and \"You Belong With Me,\" remain on the Hot 100 for 50 weeks\u2014just shy of a full year. \"Anti-Hero\" is now only one frame away from tying these two tracks, and it will likely hit that mark./nOn the most recent Hot 100, \"Anti-Hero\" has climbed from No. 26 to No. 21. This positive movement suggests that the single is likely to extend its chart run and possibly break Swift's previous record, with a potential 51- or 52-week stay./nWhile \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d may be doing well right now, Billboard's rules dictate that once a song reaches 52 weeks on the Hot 100 chart and falls below the No. 25 position, it will be removed from the ranking. Swift will soon have to contend with upcoming releases that could impact its chart position./nIf \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d does slip off of the Hot 100 in a week or so, it likely won\u2019t return...so can it break her all-time record before that happens? Only time Weill tell, but at the moment, it stands a good shot of achieving that milestone./n"

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nThe pop superstar\u2019s new version of her 2014 blockbuster is due Friday, following a summer of media saturation and her 10th No. 1 hit./nBy Ben Sisario/nTaylor Swift\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d has been a fixture in the Top 20 of Billboard\u2019s album chart for months. Stuffed with some of the singer\u2019s biggest pop hits, like \u201cShake It Off\u201d and \u201cBlank Space,\u201d the LP was a gargantuan hit when it was released in 2014, and this year Swift has been performing its songs on her record-breaking Eras Tour./nBut \u201c1989\u201d is about to make an all-but-certain plunge down the chart./nOpen this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS./nThat\u2019s because on Friday, Swift will release \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d the latest installment in her ambitious and wildly successful project to rerecord her first six studio albums. What began a few years ago as an attempt to reclaim her music \u2014 and, perhaps, have a taste of revenge \u2014 after the sale of her former record label has become a blockbuster enterprise all its own, with punishing consequences for the original recordings./n\u201c1989\u201d will be the fourth of Swift\u2019s remakes, and each one so far has opened at No. 1 with successively bigger numbers. In early 2021, \u201cFearless\u201d started with the equivalent of 291,000 sales in the United States. \u201cRed,\u201d anchored by a smoldering, 10-minute extended version of the song \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d had 605,000 later that year. \u201cSpeak Now\u201d came out in July and started with 716,000 sales, including a remarkable 268,500 copies sold on vinyl LP./nEach one has arrived with deluxe packaging, a rainbow of colored vinyl variants and a thick appendix of \u201cvault\u201d bonus tracks that have given fans abundant material to discuss and decode \u2014 not to mention well-timed batches of themed merchandise. Among the items Swift is selling at her online store are a sweater decorated with sea gulls (\u00e0 la the new album cover), for $74.89, and a device like an old-fashioned View-Master, for $19.89./nHow big \u201c1989\u201d could be is anyone\u2019s guess, and her label, Republic Records, declined to offer any projections. But given the trajectory of the previous remakes, the enduring popularity of the songs on the original album and Swift\u2019s near-total saturation of popular culture this year \u2014 in just the past few weeks, she released a hit concert film, reached No. 1 with a four-year-old song and has nearly upstaged the N.F.L. through her relationship with Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs \u2014 the music industry is bracing for a monster debut, even in a year that has had major albums by Morgan Wallen, Drake, Olivia Rodrigo and Travis Scott./nSwift has been stoking demand for \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d since announcing it in August, partnering with Google for an online puzzle to reveal clues about the album\u2019s \u201cvault\u201d tracks; naturally, it crashed within hours./nWhen Swift first spoke about her intention to rerecord her albums, in summer 2019 \u2014 shortly after the music manager Scooter Braun bought Big Machine, Swift\u2019s original label, for a bit over $300 million \u2014 the music world scratched its collective head; most previous attempts at rerecordings had had little success. But when the new version of \u201cFearless\u201d came out \u2014 by which time Braun had sold Swift\u2019s recording rights to the investment firm Shamrock Capital \u2014 it became another lesson in Swift\u2019s mastery in rallying her fan base./n\u201cWhen the rerecord process started with her, it was this curiosity, where no one really knew what it could do,\u201d said Keith Caulfield, Billboard\u2019s managing director of charts and data operations. \u201cBut they have turned into a phenomenon unto themselves.\u201d/nSwift\u2019s world tour, which has played to packed stadiums since March and is in line to sell well over $1 billion in tickets by the time it ends next year, has generally lifted her entire catalog. At various times this year, at least 10 of her albums, including the originals, have been in the Billboard 200, the magazine\u2019s flagship albums chart./nBut each time Swift has released a rerecorded album, its corresponding original version has suffered. In the year after she released \u201cFearless (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d sales of the original fell 20 percent in the United States, according to Luminate, the tracking service that supplies the data for Billboard\u2019s charts; the original \u201cRed\u201d dropped by about 45 percent. Neither has been on the Billboard 200 since 2021./nJaime Marconette, Luminate\u2019s senior director of music insights and industry relations, noted how stark that impact can be on a week-to-week basis. In May, Swift said she would release a new \u201cSpeak Now\u201d in eight weeks. \u201cThat announcement,\u201d Marconette said, \u201cimmediately drove a 75.7 percent increase in total consumption for the original version.\u201d But as soon as \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d came out, the original sank. Comparing a window of 14 weeks before and after the new version, the original fell 59 percent./nOn the latest chart, the new \u201cSpeak Now\u201d is No. 18. The old version, which was most recently No. 191, had fallen off the chart entirely./nStatistics like that call into question the value of Shamrock\u2019s investment, which has been estimated at more than $300 million. In the short term, at least, there is no doubt that Swift\u2019s rerecordings have severely dimmed the originals. But it may take years before it is clear whether there is a lasting impact. A spokeswoman for Shamrock said that no one at the firm was available to discuss the matter./nSwift also stands to earn more money from her new recordings than her old ones, thanks to a deal she negotiated with Universal Music, Republic\u2019s parent company, that gave her ownership rights to her recordings./nAs Swift\u2019s new \u201c1989\u201d nears release, the singer has been promoting it steadily on social media, this week sharing an image of handwritten lyrics that fans have interpreted as being from an unreleased track. And truckloads of vinyl and CD copies of the new album have been making their way to brick-and-mortar stores./nEven indie record shops are primed to do huge business with the new \u201c1989,\u201d as they have with all of Swift\u2019s recent releases. Carl Mello of Newbury Comics, a music and collectibles chain that has 30 stores throughout the Northeast, said that for some of Swift\u2019s previous albums, problems in the supply chain have meant that stores did not always have her records on release day. But those issues have been resolved, and the chain expects to have about 1,600 copies ready for sale on Friday./n\u201cI\u2019ve been at Newbury Comics for just over 30 years, and I\u2019ve never seen somebody who has occupied so many spots in our Top 40 vinyl records list at the same time, consistently for months and months,\u201d Mello said./n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Taylor Swift is 15 percent of our vinyl sales,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d/nAudio produced by Tally Abecassis./nBen Sisario covers the music industry.

    "content": "Taylor Swift fans were shocked after spotting Karlie Kloss attend the singer's Eras Tour on Wednesday night, despite rumors that the once-best friends were no longer on speaking terms. The supermodel, who attended the show with two friends, trended on X, formerly known as Twitter, after fellow concertgoers spotted her in the audience./nWhile the tour has seen some of Hollywood's biggest stars including Courteney Cox, Gigi Hadid, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively attend the show in the VIP section, fans were bemused to see that Karlie wasn't in the VIP area, but instead appeared to have standard tickets to the show./nTaking to Twitter, one person wrote: \"I was wondering why Karlie Kloss didn't have a public birthday party when she usually does them on this day and guys... this is her party. She's celebrating her birthday at the eras tour,\" while another person added: \"Karlie Kloss had the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever and she did. Good for her.\"/nA third person added: \"You know after I've seen so many different vile comments Swifites have made about Karlie i never would've really expected her to attend it but she's so brave, like i genuinely admire that woman like imagine having that many people hating you omg Karlie Kloss i love you.\"/nSo what happened between Taylor and Karlie? After the pair were very close from 2013, by 2017 it appeared that their friendship had cooled off, with Karlie's name being conspicuously left out Taylor's T-shirt for Look What You Made Me Do,\u00a0which included several of her famous friends named including Selena Gomez, Lena Dunham and Ed Sheeran. Taylor also didn't attend Karlie's weddings in 2018 and 2019./nThe intrigue about their fall out even interested the celebrity world, with Jennifer Lawrence previously discussing it with the New York Times, saying: \"I\u2019d like to know what\u2019s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift, that\u2019s the honest to God truth. Is nobody else curious? It\u2019s keeping me up at night. What happened?\"/nWhile Taylor has remained tight-lipped about the situation, Karlie has claimed that she and Taylor are still friends, telling New York Times: \"Don't believe everything you read.\" When asked about Jennifer's comments about their friendship, she later told Vogue: \"Jen, don\u2019t worry \u2014 Taylor and I are still really good friends.\"/nWhile there is no explanation about Karlie and Taylor's supposed fall out, fans have speculated that it could be related to Scooter Braun, who is Karlie's manager, and famously purchased Taylor's masters without her permission, leading her to re-record the music."

    "content": "November 7, 2023 by Fiona Creadon /nTransparency Item: The Perspectives section of the Graphic is comprised of articles based on opinion. This is the opinion and perspective of the writer./nBeing a fan of Taylor Swift is trendy again./nAny long-time Swiftie will tell you that, not all that long ago, a significant portion of the internet was trying to cancel Taylor Swift, largely due to an edited video of her seemingly consenting to a lyric about her in the Kanye West song \u2018Famous,\u2019 according to The Hollywood Reporter./nWest and Swift\u2019s feud snowballed into a giant hate campaign against Swift that led her to retreat from the public eye, and the theme of her sixth studio album, Reputation, was born, according to Vogue./nReputation dropped Nov. 10, 2017, and was an instant success \u2014 selling 2 million copies worldwide in the first week of its release. Following the release of the album, Swift went on the Reputation Stadium tour, which ended in Japan on Nov. 21, 2018, Swift began secretly filming for her documentary \u2014 Miss Americana \u2014 which premiered Jan. 23, 2020./nSwift had two powerful sources that helped change the perception of her and bring back the previous adoration the public had prior to the \u2018Famous\u2019 debacle. The Reputation Tour was the largest tour she had done at that point, and the documentary was critically successful and widely viewed./nThis leads us to the present day, in which Swift is on a break from the Eras Tour, which is her largest tour to date \u2014 spanning five continents. This newfound spotlight, which is likely the largest it has ever been for Swift, is exciting but not without its challenges./nIt has sparked disturbing habits from fans and the public toward Swift./nWith the way social media works, it is easy to spread news almost instantly. People use Instagram and X \u2014 formerly known as Twitter \u2014 to announce sightings of celebrities like Taylor Swift./nThese posts can be shared quickly, and all of a sudden, hundreds of people are standing outside of Swift\u2019s recording studio, home or, most egregiously, the rehearsal dinner for the wedding of her longtime friend Jack Antonoff./nSwift is no stranger to this behavior and not-so-subtly expressed her disapproval in her documentary, saying in reference to fans gathering outside her house, \u201cThis is my front yard, and I\u2019m highly aware of the fact that [fans waiting outside her house] is not normal,\u201d Swift said in Miss Americana./nOne of the few times Swift has ever potentially alluded to her frustration toward people harassing her in public comes in the form of lyrics from the song \u201cThe Lakes,\u201d which was the bonus track on Folklore, Swift\u2019s eighth studio album. In the song, she writes, \u201cI\u2019m not cut out for all these cynical clones/ These hunters with cell phones.\u201d/nWhile Swift has yet to make a public statement condemning the injudicious behavior and how it has escalated over the course of her Eras Tour, this feels like a particularly sensitive issue for Swift, who has been the victim of several stalkers and death threats./nI believe the reason Swift has yet to make a public statement about this tactless habit from some of her fans is due to the fact that her music has always been very personal, and this can create an exaggerated sense of closeness between her and her fans./nMany fans think they know about all the inner workings of Swift\u2019s life and thus have a right to see her, connect with her, etc., according to a BuzzFeed article. This, in its essence, is the definition of a parasocial relationship./nIt is undeniable that Swift has always cared deeply about her fans. She has sent fans Christmas gifts, made donations to fans during the pandemic and even hosted secret sessions for her albums \u201c1989,\u201d \u201cReputation\u201d and \u201cLover.\u201d  /nThese are gatherings she hosted at her houses to give fans an opportunity to meet her, listen to her albums prior to their releases and take photos with her./nHowever, as a society, it is important to firmly draw a distinction between being a fan and being a stalker. Recently, it seems that line has blurred./nIt is not acceptable to show up at a place where you believe someone might be, celebrity or not. If this was done to a private citizen, it would be considered stalking./nBecause Swift is a public figure, all sense of decorum has gone out the window. Not only is the constant pursuit of Swift\u2019s whereabouts highly inappropriate, but it can become very dangerous for both Swift and her fans./nThis is because a large crowd of people or cars chasing after someone is not conducive to a normal public environment and creates chaos. We do not have to look far back in history to see when fans and paparazzi chasing stars had fatal consequences./nI am a fan of Swift, so I completely understand the love and connection that people can feel for an artist. However, the kindest thing we can do as fans is respect those artists\u2019 privacy./nThere is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to take a moment to stop a celebrity to say hello or express your appreciation for their work. However, Swift is of a level of fame that anywhere she goes, she is likely to encounter dozens, if not hundreds, of fans./nSwift can no longer be easily accessed, and we have to accept that as fans. Let\u2019s give her the gift of going to a restaurant, a friend\u2019s party, her place of work or even her home without feeling like she is being hunted down./nTaylor Swift has always made an effort to make her fans feel seen and appreciated. Let\u2019s pay her back by respecting her privacy./n_______________________/nFollow the Graphic on Twitter: @PeppGraphic/nContact Fiona Creadon via Instagram (@Fiocreao) or by email: fiona.creadon@pepperdine.edu/nFiled Under: Perspectives Tagged With: fandom, fans, Fiona Creadon, perspectives, problematic, reputation, Swiftie, Taylor Swift., the Graphic, trends"

The re-recorded take on her pop blockbuster 1989 is expected on October 27, and that means it\u2019s time to hype up the world for the title\u2026as if people weren\u2019t already excited. But while it might seem like Swift has only just recently started promoting the forthcoming chart-topper, she\u2019s actually been doing so for years now./nShe may have only announced it formally in early August, but Swift has actually been getting the public ready for 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) for quite some time, as it\u2019s expected to be massive. The singer released the first taste of the album more than two years ago. In September 2021, Swift dropped \"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)\" without warning, thrilling her legion of listeners./n\"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version),\u201d the re-recorded take of her 1989 single \u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d quickly became another top 40 hit for Swift, as it debuted and peaked at No. 37 on the Hot 100. Fans immediately expected an announcement that 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) was on its way, but that didn\u2019t turn out to be the case./nMore than half a year later, Swift once again gave her dedicated followers reason to believe that 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) was on its way. In May 2022, she released \u201cThis Love (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d after it was teased in the trailer for the Amazon\nAMZN\n series The Summer I Turned Pretty. The reworking of 1989 track \u201cThis Love\u201d was also a Hot 100 success, peaking at No. 50. But again, the CD didn\u2019t come./nEarlier this week, The singer-songwriter crashed Google when she teamed up with the tech giant to create online word puzzles her fans could solve as a way to reveal the \u201cFrom The Vault\u201d tunes set to be premiered on the new album. She announced that game via an animated video she posted to Instagram, and the topic quickly went viral./nBy doing so, Swift officially began promoting 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), or so it may seem. Swift has actually been getting the world ready for the title for years, and all that work and planning will surely pay off when it opens atop the Billboard 200, likely with the largest starting sum of any of her re-releases./n"

As \"Karma,\" \"Cruel Summer,\" and \"Anti-Hero\" maintain their strong presence among the top performers in the U.S., an unexpected yet delightful surprise has arrived: the reemergence of Swift's track \"August.\" This resurgence could potentially propel the song back onto various Billboard charts, breathing new life into what is becoming another classic for her./n\"August\" is swiftly ascending Spotify's daily chart of the most-streamed tracks across the globe, marking a noticeable comeback. The song's trajectory is nothing short of remarkable, skyrocketing from outside the top 40 on July 31 to the No. 4 position on August 1. This notable ascent is made possible by over 5.1 million streams within a single day\u2013a remarkable feat for a track that has already amassed millions of plays over the years./nThe synchronicity of the resurgence is evident, with the shift from July to August serving as the catalyst for the track's renewed popularity. Swift's dedicated fanbase worldwide clearly rushed to celebrate the arrival of the new month by indulging in \"August.\"/nInitially unveiled as part of Swift's surprise album Folklore, which was released in the midst of the global Covid-19 pandemic in July 2020, \"August\" was never officially launched as a single. Despite this, it found its way onto charts, hitting No. 23 on the Hot 100. The track also secured a spot in the top 10 of genre-specific Billboard charts, including the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs list, where it climbed as high as No. 5./nThe newfound streaming success currently being enjoyed by \"August\" means the tune now has the potential to return to various charts in the days and weeks to come. The song's consistent stream count, which have brought it to an impressive ranking on both Spotify's global and U.S.-only charts, bodes well for its chances of making a real comeback./n"

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nThe show\u2019s first new broadcast in six months opened with a somber reflection by Davidson, the host, and included a brief appearance by Swift, who was a running theme of the episode./nBy Dave Itzkoff/nIn its first new broadcast in six months, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d returned to a starkly serious world and to news developments seemingly impervious to any kind of comedic commentary. Would this topical sketch show in any way address the Israel-Hamas war? Should it? As it has in previous times of crisis, \u201cS.N.L.\u201d met the moment by taking things seriously, and in this case found an unexpectedly poignant spokesman in this week\u2019s host, Pete Davidson./nDavidson, an \u201cS.N.L.\u201d alumnus, began the show by speaking directly to the audience, reminding them that his father, a firefighter, had been killed in the 9/11 attacks. \u201cThis week,\u201d Davidson said, \u201cwe saw the horrible images and stories from Israel and Gaza. And I know what you\u2019re thinking: Who better to comment on it than Pete Davidson?\u201d/nHe continued:/nWell, in a lot of ways, I am a good person to talk about it because when I was 7 years old, my dad was killed in a terrorist attack, so I know something about what that\u2019s like. I saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering, Israeli children and Palestinian children. And it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place. No one in this world deserves to suffer like that, especially not kids./nDavidson shared a story about how, in the months that followed, his mother had sought to cheer him up by giving him what she thought was a Disney movie \u2014 but turned out to be the Eddie Murphy stand-up special \u201cDelirious.\u201d Though it may not have been ideal material for an 8-year-old, it did make Davidson laugh./n\u201cSometimes comedy is really the only way forward through tragedy,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cMy heart is with everyone whose lives have been destroyed this week. But tonight, I\u2019m going to do what I\u2019ve always done in the face of tragedy, and that\u2019s try to be funny. Remember, I said \u2018Try.\u2019\u201d/nDavidson\u2019s monologue was an abbreviated stand-up set, delivered in his more traditional manner \u2014 no topical material but lots of ribald jokes we can\u2019t safely transcribe here, so caveat emptor./nAmong the subjects that we can (just about) get away with mentioning, Davidson discussed an ill-fated attempt to bond with his sister by watching the fantasy series \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which neither of them had seen. \u201cI thought it was like dragons and stuff, and magic,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cHardly any dragons. Lots of incest. Tons of incest. So much incest. You could leave the house, come back, incest still happening.\u201d/nHe also joked about his Staten Island roots and how it was not necessarily his childhood dream to become a comedian. \u201cMy dream was to be a construction worker,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was. Hopefully work for a construction company for like eight years, and then if I\u2019m lucky, fall off a ladder. Sue the city for six mil, settle for three. Marry some chick I had a crush on in high school. That I\u2019m not even really into anymore \u2014 but no one else can have her!\u201d/nThough she wasn\u2019t announced ahead of time as a participant in this week\u2019s show, Taylor Swift \u2014 who, you may have heard, has a new movie out this weekend \u2014 was not only a surprise guest on \u201cS.N.L.\u201d but the running theme of this week\u2019s broadcast: A sketch that lampooned Fox\u2019s NFL coverage leaned heavily on jokes about the pop star\u2019s burgeoning relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and concluded with a cameo from the football player./nSwift was also referenced in a filmed segment from Please Don\u2019t Destroy and in a Weekend Update desk segment that cast Bowen Yang as Christopher Columbus. For good measure, Swift herself showed up to introduce a second performance from this week\u2019s musical guest, Ice Spice. Mikey Day showed off his friendship bracelets during \u201cS.N.L.\u201d good-nights, but Swift herself wasn\u2019t seen there. She has an empire to run, after all./nThis being an \u201cS.N.L.\u201d episode centered on Davidson means that you\u2019re going to get a lot of sketches about the fact that Davidson is, well, Davidson and lives the life that Davidson lives. That said, he and \u201cS.N.L.\u201d availed themselves pretty well with this segment that both parodies and faithfully recreates a musical lamentation performed by Ryan Gosling in this summer\u2019s hit comedy \u201cBarbie.\u201d/nThe many, many references to Davidson\u2019s real-life exploits are too numerous to catalog here, but we would like to acknowledge this verse in particular:/nI\u2019m just Pete.Anyone else, I\u2019d be a threeBut I guess I\u2019m hot for dudes in comedy\u2019cause it\u2019s an ugly industry./nOver at the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the Israel-Hamas War and Laphonza Butler\u2019s appointment to the Senate seat formerly held by Dianne Feinstein./nJost began:/nWell, this was a terrible week for the world but a great week for random idiots who like to share completely unhinged thoughts wherever they can. And weirdly it\u2019s not even on social media anymore. I saw a 1,000-word essay called \u201cHow I\u2019d Fix Palestine,\u201d and it was posted in a Yelp review of a Buffalo Wild Wings./nEven world leaders who could be making it better are making it worse. For example, former President Trump went out of his way to praise the terrorist group Hezbollah, calling them \u201cvery smart.\" Though in Trump\u2019s defense he thinks Hezbollah is the genie from Aladdin./nChe continued:/nLaphonza Butler was sworn in as California\u2019s newest senator, becoming the first openly [gay] Black woman in Congress. \u201cUm, you mean second,\u201d said George Santos./nDave Itzkoff is a culture reporter whose latest book, \u201cRobin,\u201d a biography of Robin Williams, was published in May 2018.

Last week, on Sunday, September 24, the \u201cEnchanted\u201d artist broke the internet after fans realized that she was sitting alongside Travis\u2019 mom, Donna Kelce, in the Travis Kelce Suite at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri./nWithin minutes, photos and videos of Taylor went completely viral. Since then, Swifites and football fans alike can\u2019t get enough of the blossoming romance between the pop star and the two-time Super Bowl champion./nThe Taylor and Travis saga began back in July after the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast host shared a story about trying to give the songwriter his phone number. \u201cWell, I was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\u201d Travis recalled to his brother, Jason Kelce, after attending night 2 of the Eras Tour in Kansas City./n\u201cSo, I was little butthurt that I didn\u2019t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her. If you\u2019re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there,\u201d Travis continued. \u201cBut I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it. \u2026 She doesn\u2019t meet anybody, or at least, she didn\u2019t want to meet me, so I took it personal.\u201d/nSince then, it\u2019s clear that something\u00a0is happening between the beloved pair. In fact, following the Chiefs game last week against the Chicago Bears, Taylor and Travis drove off in the athlete\u2019s convertible (a.k.a. their getaway car) and attended an afterparty with the rest of the team./nWhile celebrating at Prime Social in Kansas City, Taylor sweetly wrapped her arms around Travis\u2019 neck, as per a photo obtained by TMZ./nMoreover, during a September 27 episode of \u201cNew Heights,\u201d Travis gushed over Taylor. \u201cShout-out to Taylor for pulling up. That was pretty ballsy,\u201d he joked with Jason. \u201cI just thought it was awesome how everyone in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. The friends and family. She looked amazing, everybody was talking about her in a great light. On top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course. We script it all ladies and gentlemen. It was just impressive.\u201d/nPrior to Travis, Taylor\u2019s most notable relationship was with her now-ex-boyfriend of six years, Joe Alwyn. The pair called it quits in April 2023. As for Travis, his last relationship was with Kayla Nicole from 2017 to 2022./n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCelebrity Splits of 2023: Britney Spears, Reese Witherspoon, & More Stars Who Have Called It Quits This Year\t\t\t\t\n"

I was with Lori on a trip to Boston in 2019, sitting at an Italian restaurant and waiting for our dinner, when she manically tried to purchase tickets on her phone to Swift\u2019s Lover Fest, the ill-fated 2020 outing in support of Swift\u2019s seventh studio album, \u201cLover.\u201d That would have played off as the first big concert at the all-new SoFi Stadium that year had it not been for the COVID-19 pandemic./nI just also happened to be with her and two of our girlfriends on a trip to Big Bear when Swift dropped her latest album, \u201cMidnights,\u201d last year. We stayed up to listen to the album through and through in our cozy cabin as the clock struck midnight./nWhen The Eras Tour went on sale last year and the overwhelming amount of fans crashed the Ticketmaster website, Lori and her longtime friend Andrea Ramos of Yorba Linda were both frantically attempting to score tickets to any and every show. By some divine stroke of luck \u2014 and hours and hours with no bathroom breaks \u2014 Ramos was able to pick up tickets for the Totten ladies, herself, and her 18-year-old daughter Emma, to Swift\u2019s concert on May 5 in Nashville, Tennessee. After more stress and haggling, the two now-very-savvy ticket-buying women were finally able to secure tickets to a show closer to home and bought passes to see Swift at SoFi Stadium on the first night of the tour on Thursday, Aug. 3, too. The Totten\u2019s are also going to the shows on Aug. 7-9 and Ramos women are headed to Aug. 7 and 9, too./nSo why all of the trouble and headaches just to see this one artist on tour?/nI joined Lori, Andrea, Tiffany and Emma on their ride to see Swift in Inglewood on Aug. 3 to find out that it wasn\u2019t just about the music, there was much more to it./n\u201cI just love what a phenomenal role model Taylor is for my kid,\u201d Andrea said as we cruised down the 91 Freeway on the way to the show. \u201cWhen \u2018Reputation\u2019 came out, Emma started having a stronger voice. It\u2019s like \u2018Reputation\u2019 released Emma. Not to mention Taylor is just kind, generous and a great businesswoman.\u201d/nEmma and Tiffany have known each other since about the age of three and grew up dancing competitively \u2014 even one year dressing up as Swifties with blonde bob wigs and dancing to Swift\u2019s music./n\u201cAw, we are each other\u2019s longest friend,\u201d Emma realizes as the two, who are cozied in the back of the vehicle adjusting their \u201cFolklore\u201d and \u201cMidnights\u201d themed outfits and pondering aloud which secret songs Swift will play later that evening. (Spoiler alert: It was \u201cMaroon\u201d and \u201cI Can See You (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d.)/n\u201cI have a bracelet that says \u2018I heart Mama Swift\u2019 and I just think Taylor\u2019s mom has to be such a great person to have raised such a great daughter,\u201d Andrea said, referring to Swift\u2019s mother, also named Andrea, who has become a rock star herself at her daughter\u2019s shows, as she walks the venues to meet fans./n\u201cI mean, the two of us are raising daughters, too, and it\u2019s not easy,\u201d she added./nI asked the young women why they liked Swift\u2019s music and was met with a loud \u201cPffttt\u201d and a laugh from Emma, the kind of response only a teenager could deliver without uttering, \u201cDuh! My mom\u2019s friend\u201d at me./n\u201cThere are too many things, I can\u2019t even name,\u201d Tiffany offered./nAnd I very much believe she feels that way./nFor their mothers, it has become something special that they can share with their daughters./n\u201cIt\u2019s something that Tiffany and I can bond over,\u201d Lori said. \u201cShe has her music and I have mine, but this is our music. I also love that Taylor is so great with her fans and the music just makes me feel good.\u201d/nFor Andrea, this is her final summer at home with Emma for now, who is heading to Indiana State University next year. As luck would have it, the day we were headed to Inglewood, Swift announced additional dates for The Eras Tour in 2024. And she\u2019s hitting Indianapolis, not far from Emma\u2019s new college, in November./n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to get tickets,\u201d Andrea assures. \u201cI just like that I have this time with Emma. I get to experience this with her.\u201d/nLori is the first to admit she\u2019s gone a little overboard this year with The Eras Tour, especially with her outfits. Since she\u2019s going to four shows in Inglewood, she has a different outfit for each evening, all inspired by Swift\u2019s costuming in her music videos or on previous tours. She did give my friends and me a fashion show the week before of each outfit, stuff she purchased off of Poshmark and Etsy and went to work bedazzling and glittering herself to make the looks just right. She did this for herself as well as for Tiffany and she laugh-cringes when she shares the outfits for four Southern California dates and the early stop in Nashville cost over a grand. She and Tiffany also made dozens of Swiftie friendship bracelets, each one with a Swift saying and song titles or lyrics, dates and more that meant something to them./nAnd because they\u2019re both cat ladies, just like Swift, Lori made tiny little friendship bracelets for cats to give fellow cat-loving Swifties./n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how much those little beads cost,\u201d she said with a laugh./nSome may think it\u2019s insane to indulge so much in a silly little concert, but as these women put the final touches on their outfits and drew on glittery 13s on the backs of their hands (Swift\u2019s favorite number), I watched them laugh, smile, hug and at time squeal in delight as they met other Swifties on the way up to the Stadium./nIt was almost like a scene from the new \u201cBarbie\u201d movie \u2014 instead of the normal \u201cHi, Barbie!\u201d greeting inside Barbieland, it was \u201cHi, Swiftie\u201d in Taylorland. They took pictures, traded bracelets with other fans and danced to the Swift songs that were being played outside the venue in anticipation for the big event./nThey scream-cried-sang and danced through the entire show and took lots of pictures and videos to post on social media. And, of course, they picked up more merch./n\u201cIt\u2019s totally worth it,\u201d Lori said of their Eras Tour experience."

    "content": "The music and sports worlds are buzzing with anticipation as pop sensation\u00a0Taylor Swift\u00a0and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce appear to be getting closer. Recent events have shown these two stars might be more than just passing acquaintances./nOver the weekend, Taylor was captured on video footage obtained by Daily Mail departing Travis's upscale mansion in Kansas City.\u00a0/nInterestingly, she was accompanied not by Travis but by a group of his friends and family. This entourage then boarded a party bus destined for Arrowhead Stadium./nThe mansion, worth in the region of $1 million, wasn\u2019t housing Travis at that time. According to reports, he has a personal chef and several friends from high school and college who use his place as a crash pad whenever they are in town. But that wasn\u2019t all; to ensure Taylor's safety, two unmarked police cars stood guard outside the football star's home./nThe whispers of a possible relationship between the two hit fever pitch last weekend. Taylor was unexpectedly spotted in the Chiefs' suite, where she cheered the team on to a triumphant victory over the Chicago Bears with a score of 41-10.\u00a0/nBut the real talk started post-game when Taylor and Travis were seen making a swift exit through the stadium corridors together. Later that evening, they were reportedly at an exclusive downtown bar, which Travis had booked for the night./nAlthough efforts were made to keep the post-game celebrations private, \u00a0a particularly telling photo of Taylor comfortably draping her arm around Travis, hinted at the intimacy between the two./nAdding to the intrigue, Travis' brother, Jason Kelce, didn\u2019t hold back during a recent chat on SportsRadio 94 WIP.\u00a0/nJason shared: \u201cTravis is going above and beyond to be a gentleman\u201d towards Taylor. He continued with a touch of humor, mentioning that Travis can effortlessly shift gears, suggesting that he can balance his blossoming relationship with his demanding career./nThe relationship seems to be gathering momentum rapidly, with reports suggesting Taylor plans to attend the Chiefs\u2019 upcoming match against the New York Jets.\u00a0/nTravis, in one of his recent podcasts, commented on Taylor's previous game appearance, labeling her decision as \u201cballsy\u201d.\u00a0/nHe seemed genuinely touched by her gesture, expressing gratitude towards those who spoke highly of her. \u201cShoutout to Taylor for coming through and seeing me rock the stage,\u201d he said, playfully referring to his performance on the football field./n"

Nationally, a female got paid 83 cents for every $1 a man got./nSo where\u2019s the best place for female workers, looking at this compensation chasm? Women in Rhode Island earn 92% of men. That\u2019s followed by Delaware at 91% and Wisconsin at 89%. Lows? Utah and Wyoming at 75%./nOver the five years tracked, however,\u00a0California\u2019s gap narrowed by only 0.2 percentage points, ranking No. 32 and trailing the 1.3-point improvement nationally. The divide shrank in 32 states./nLeading the pack was Wisconsin, which shrank its gap by 11 points. Connecticut\u2019s gap contracted 10.4 points and Rhode Island 7.2. The lowest contractions were found in New Mexico where its gap widened by 7 points, followed by Arizona up 5.8, and Indiana up 5.1./nLet\u2019s start with job counts because the opportunity to get a paycheck is just as critical as the pay itself./nCalifornia employed the most women \u2013 5.6 million in 2021, 11% of the nation\u2019s 51 million. Next came Texas (4.5 million), Florida (3.5 million), New York (3 million), and Illinois (2 million)./nBut\u00a0California\u2019s female share of jobs was sixth-lowest at 43% vs. 45% nationally.

Idaho at 41%, then Wisconsin at 42%./nOr look at women\u2019s job growth over five years. California ranked No. 29 at 3% vs. 5% nationally. Women in 41 states enjoyed gains./nTops were Utah at 23%, then Arizona at 18%, and Idaho at 17%. Lows? Hawaii saw female workers dip by 6%, then New York and Wisconsin, were off 5%./nThe pandemic business limitations varied widely across the nation in 2021. So, I also looked at the job-growth gap between women and men./nCalifornia female workers fared much better with their job growth topping men by 5.4 percentage points. That was 16th best among the states and topped the 2.9-point women\u2019s advantage nationally. Female job growth topped males in 40 states./nTops? Utah\u2019s job growth for women bested men by 18 percentage points, then came Nevada at 13, and Wyoming at 11. Lows? Wisconsin, where women fared 12 points worse, then Indiana, off 7 points, and Minnesota, off 6./nNow let\u2019s talk weekly earnings./nCalifornia ranked No. 9 at $1,020 vs. $912 nationally. Tops? D.C. at $1,565, then Massachusetts at $1,157, and Maryland at $1,134. Lows? Mississippi at $722, then Oklahoma at $738, and South Carolina and West Virginia at $756./nCalifornia women\u2019s pay rose 25% in five years, No. 8 among the states and topping 22% growth nationally./nEvery state had female pay raises, topped by D.C.\u2019s 40%, then Rhode Island at 38%, and Wisconsin at 29%. Lows? West Virginia and South Carolina at 10%, and Arizona at 12%./nAnd ponder the wage gap another way: 2016-2021 earnings improvements by gender./nCalifornia ranked No. 32 for women\u2019s raises vs. men \u2013 only 0.2 percentage points better vs. a 1.9 gap nationally.

    "content": "Each night of Taylor Swift\u2019s blockbuster Eras tour, superfan Tess Bohne gets dressed up in her best Swift-themed outfit, paying homage to a beloved song, a red-carpet look or an album\u2019s anniversary. By then, she\u2019s already researched the projected set time, along with the exact minute Swift is expected to play her much-anticipated surprise songs that are unique to each concert./nBut as the onstage countdown clock approaches zero, signaling Swift\u2019s entrance, Bohne, 32, isn\u2019t cheering from a stadium. Instead, at home in Salt Lake City, she fires up her husband\u2019s laptop, searches for feeds from fans holding up their phones in the crowd and begins to broadcast a livestream of Swift\u2019s three-hour-plus set on TikTok to her 160,000 (and counting) followers./nNight after night, thousands of Swifties are gathering to watch the superstar perform their favorite songs through their 5-inch phone screens. For some with tickets to future shows, it\u2019s a chance to preview the  set list and better prepare for the big day. For others who enjoyed an earlier stop of the tour, it\u2019s a way to relive cherished memories and keep in touch with the community./nAnd for fans who can\u2019t afford the lofty ticket prices or live too far from a destination city, these unauthorized TikTok livestreams are the only way to get a glimpse of her billion-dollar-grossing, Ticketmaster-crashing tour./nBohne, the unofficial \u201cEras tour cruise director,\u201d has become a one-stop shop for fans looking to watch from home. /n Music /nCultural dominance. History-making album sales. Sold-out stadiums. Add them up, and Taylor Swift\u2019s current moment has little precedent in pop-music history./nAug. 1, 2023/nAfter attending the second show of the tour in Glendale, Ariz., Bohne watched livestreams on TikTok night after night, looking to recapture the magic of seeing Swift in the flesh. Often, the experience paled in comparison to the real thing \u2014 choppy feeds would cut in and out or drop entirely, or an overly eager fan\u2019s earnest singing would drown out the notes from the stage. But instead of giving up, Bohne resolved to curate and improve the livestream viewing experience./nShe first went live on TikTok when the tour stopped in Atlanta at the end of April. At one point, her control center included multiple iPads, allowing her to track down alternate streams and switch back and forth when videos cut off midset./n\u201cWe called it the iPad Shuffle,\u201d Bohne said. \u201cIn the beginning it was just a place where people could see where to find these streams. It wasn\u2019t a great concert experience. But then it turned into a seamless watching experience.\u201d/nThese days, Bohne goes live from her husband\u2019s work computer while using an iPhone and iPad to scour TikTok, as well as sites like swiftstream.gay and various Twitch accounts, for backup streams. As her reach has grown, a number of brands have reached out seeking collaboration opportunities; she\u2019s typically more excited to hear directly from Swift fans expressing their gratitude for her work./n\u201cI had two different people message me and say they had panic attacks during the shows, and sitting down to watch the stream has been healing for them,\u201d Bohne said. \u201cOthers had really bad anxiety trying to track down these streams, and I\u2019ve been able to alleviate that for them. It makes me feel like I\u2019m doing something worthwhile.\u201d/n Entertainment & Arts /nParking! Public transit! Fan chants! Friendship bracelets! Everything you need to know before you see Taylor Swift at SoFi Stadium for the L.A. stops of her Eras tour./nAug. 4, 2023/nAn essential part of the ersatz Eras-watching experience is Swiftball, a Taylor-fied fantasy football game started by Twitter user @reckedmaserati, in which fans attempt to predict outfits, surprise songs and other goings-on. Winners have received prizes ranging from Swift CDs to merchandise to handcrafted art, all of which are donated by other Swiftball players. /nThe most recent Swiftball on July 29 received more than 11,000 submissions on Twitter, and on a typical TikTok stream, you\u2019ll find a jumble of fans erupting with digital cheers or boos each time an answer is revealed./n\u201cTikTok is the pinnacle of this,\u201d said Russ Crupnick, managing partner at marketing research and industry analysis company MusicWatch and a professor at New York University. \u201cIt helps to magnify everything that\u2019s going on around a tour. In the old days, if you didn\u2019t have a ticket, you didn\u2019t get to participate. Now you can.\u201d/nAt the outset of the tour, it was harder to avoid the Swift livestreams on TikTok than it was to find them. In its quest to push the most engaging live videos to its For You page, TikTok\u2019s algorithm boosted bootleg streams of the concert nearly every night, as Swifties locked in for hours and commented away./nEventually, TikTok removed streamers while they were live and suppressed them from the For You page./n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s become a lot harder to find streams,\u201d Bohne said. \u201cI got suspended once by TikTok, about two weeks ago, for intellectual property. That\u2019s what\u2019s been a little bit frustrating. I can have permission from someone who\u2019s at the show to [use their stream], but if they\u2019re not supposed to be streaming, I don\u2019t know.\u201d/nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, created in 1998, protects platforms from being held liable for content that infringes on copyrighted material, as long as the platform has a mechanism for rights holders to report and take down the offending content. During the internet\u2019s early years, it was easier for copyright holders to locate and remove such items. Now, the proliferation of content has made that game of whack-a-mole virtually impossible./n\u201cThere are dozens if not hundreds of these videos popping up,\u201d said Tatiana Cirisano, senior music analyst at Midia Research. \u201cThere\u2019s a sentiment that this law was built before social media really existed, and it was meant to allow for creativity, and allow platforms to host things other people had made, without worrying about liability. But this was before there was so much content posted all the time, so now, it doesn\u2019t really work.\u201d/nRepresentatives for Swift and TikTok did not return a request for comment. /n Entertainment & Arts /nNot a lover of $100 parking spaces? There are plenty of ways to get to Taylor Swift\u2019s concerts at SoFi Stadium by train or bus./nJuly 31, 2023/nSince the pandemic shuttered live music in 2020, authorized concert livestreams have grown in popularity. Just about every major festival streams the majority of its sets on platforms such as YouTube or Twitch, and according to a report from Midia Research, the amount of people watching shows from home nearly doubled in the past two years, from 9.3% at the end of 2020 to 17.7% at the end of 2022./nFans who consume the raw, user-generated streams on TikTok typically skew younger than YouTube audiences drawn to professional-quality recordings, but Cirisano believes that livestreams, whether authorized or bootleg, won\u2019t cannibalize ticket sales. /n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously overlap between [ticket-buying and livestreaming audiences],\u201d Cirisano said. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing that can replace the in-person concert.\u201d/nCrupnick argues that labels and music publishers shouldn\u2019t prioritize filing copyright strikes against fans who are providing free promotion for their favorite acts. Instead, he says, the growth of user-generated livestreaming could become another negotiating chip in the copyright owners\u2019 fight to extract more money from the social platform./n\u201cAt some point, they could take it all down, but fans will put it back up just as fast,\u201d Crupnick said. \u201cI think what the labels really want is fair compensation from TikTok.\u201d/nFor Bohne, the TikTok livestreams are another way to feel connected to Swift./n\u201cIf I could talk to Taylor, my message to her would just be a giant thank you,\u201d Bohne said. \u201cShe\u2019s given us a community where we can find people who understand one another.\u201d/nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

[+] Hugh Jackman cheer prior to the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium on October 01, 2023 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)/nThe NFL is, by a wide margin, the most popular sport in the United States. Despite its marketing and ratings prowess, the league continues its efforts of expanding its fanbase. This includes reaching out to Latinos (where f\u00fatbol is another sport) and expanding globally (this season the NFL will be playing five games in England and Germany.)/nAlso, having Amazon Prime Video stream Thursday Night Football games attracts a younger more digital savvy audience. Perhaps, another marketing strategy should be having singer-songwriting superstar Taylor Swift in attendance at more games. Swift was seen at the last two Kansas City Chiefs games, amplifying viewer interest into a social event with her legion of fans known as \u201cSwifties\u201d./nThere had been rumors swirling that Taylor Swift had been seeing Kansas City Chiefs eight-time all-pro tight end Travis Kelce. The widespread speculation was confirmed on September 24, when the 12-time Grammy Award winner was seen at Kansas City\u2019s Arrowhead Stadium alongside Kelce\u2019s mother. Throughout the game, Fox, which televised the contest, repeatedly showed Swift cheering in a luxury suite. Taylor Swift\u2019s appearance came during a break of her blockbuster concert tour called the Eras Tour. During the tour, Swift had performed at Arrowhead Stadium on July 7-8./nThe late Sunday afternoon game, branded as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Game of the Week\u201d, reported the game had averaged 24.3 million viewers, the most watched television program of the week. Despite the strong audience, the viewing was off by 8% compared to the corresponding game last season (a marquee matchup between quarterbacks Tom Brady of Tampa Bay and Aaron Rodgers of Green Bay). Last season, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Game of the Week\u201d averaged 24.1 million viewers, making it the most watched TV program for the 14th straight year./nOne reason for the ratings falloff was the game was lopsided, with Kansas City leading the Chicago Bears 34-0 at halftime, before coasting to a 41-10 victory. In the game Kelce also scored a touchdown. In a postgame interview, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Jr., after learning Swift was in attendance, made sure Kelce would score./nSwift\u2019s appearance also had a halo effect for Kelce and the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs. For example:/n/n/nThe following week Swift was in attendance when Kansas City played the New York Jets in New Jersey\u2019s Meadowlands on NBC\u2019s Sunday Night Football. In the game Kansas City defeated the Jets 23-10. When Front Office Sports reported Swift would be in attendance her fans hoping to get a glimpse of the multiplatinum singer spiked, TickPick reported online ticket prices soared from $83 to $119, a 40% increase. The last time Swift was at the Meadowlands was last May, during her Eras Tour, when she broke attendance records over three days./nInstead of sitting with Kelce\u2019s mother, for the Meadowlands game, Swift came to the game accompanied by such celebrities as Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Sophie Tucker and High Jackman among others./nTravis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates after defeating the Chicago Bears at GEHA ... [+] Field at Arrowhead Stadium on September 24, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri. (Photo by Cooper Neill/Getty Images)/nAs expected, the game was a hit with NBC, which repeatedly showed Swift throughout the game, averaging 27 million viewers on NBC and digital platforms. This was the second most watched NFL game of the season, following the NFL Kick-off Classic last month (27.5 million). Moreover, when compared to the season average, Sunday Night Football ratings among female teens (age 12-to-17) grew by 53%, the audience among women age 18-to-24 increased 24% while women age 35+ rose 34%./nThe audience delivery was also 22% higher than the corresponding game last season (Kansas City vs. Tampa Bay). Sunday Night Football has been the highest rated primetime program on television over the past 12 years. Last season Sunday Night Football averaged 19.9 million viewers including digital platforms./nNext Sunday Kansas City will play a road game against the Minnesota Vikings. Although there has been no announcement that Swift will be attending, ticket sales have also been spiking for that game./nOf note, the first game Swift attended was also the most watched program with females including Woman 18-49 in which Roku TV reported ratings growth of 63%. Females are another group the NFL has been reaching out to. According to a survey conducted last April and reported by Statistica, 24% of the females called themselves avid fans of the NFL, with 42% responding they were not fans at all. By comparison, 51% of males considered themselves avid fans of the NFL with 19% calling themselves not a fan at all./nAlso, as the NFL audience gets older, \u201cSwifties\u201d tend to be younger. A survey from Morning Consult, released earlier this year, found 45% of avid Swift fans are millennials between the ages of 27 and 42 while another 11% are \u201cGen Z\u201d, under the age of 26. By comparison, last year the median age of the NFL television audience was 54 and aging. (On Amazon\nAMZN\n the median age was 47.)/nSwift\u2019s Eras Tour had been generating $13 million in ticket sales each night and is expected to be the highest-grossing concert tour of all time generating billions of dollars. Forbes reported Swift had earned $92 million. The Eras Tour is expected to earn Swift hundreds of millions of dollars. Swift\u2019s net worth is an estimated $740 million./nLooking ahead, the concert film Taylor Swift: The Era Tour will be released in 100+ countries on October 13. Industry analysts project the opening weekend will generate over $100 million in box office. During its Sunday Night Football several promos for the movie aired. Swift\u2019s global concert tour resumes on November 9 in Argentina (a bye week for the Kansas City Chiefs). Next year, the Eras Tour continues with tour dates in Europe, Asia and Australia, before returning to North America in the fall./nBy comparison, Sportrac reports Travis Kelce, a future Hall of Famer, will earn $12.3 million playing in the NFL this season. Over his 11-year NFL career Kelce has earned over $77 million in salary. Another income source for Kelce is product endorsements. Kelce has been a spokesperson for Bud Light, Pfizer\nPFE\n Covid-19 vaccines, DirecTV, Sleep Number\nSNBR\n, Experian, McDonalds and co-stars in a State Farm commercial with teammate Mahomes. Forbes reports Kelce\u2019s product endorsements generate an additional $3 million. Kelce has an estimated net worth of $40 million./nAfter his playing days are over Kelce has expressed an interest in the entertainment industry. Besides his podcast, back in 2016, Kelce was the star of a dating competition show on E! called Catching Kelce. In the reality program Kelce seeks a companion from one of 50 females representing 50 states. Last March 4 Kelce hosted Saturday Night Live./nWhether it's long-term or not, Kelce\u2019s relationship with Swift will only boost media presence. In a radio interview Bill Belichick, the longtime head coach of the New England Patriots quipped, \u201cWell, I would say that Travis Kelce has had a lot of big catches in his career. This would be the biggest.\"/n"

The tour has still yet to begin its second\u00a0North American leg, which will start in 2024. /nThe price for an average ticket sale for the Eras Tour in the US was about $455.78. However, it is not clear how many tickets were purchased during each order. QuestionPro\u00a0reports that there were about 72,459 people in attendance at each show./n[RELATED: Taylor Swift Extends North American Dates of Eras Tour Into 2024]/nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is expected to pull in\u00a0$2.2 billion\u00a0in revenue, making it the highest-grossing tour of all time. If it gets to its expected gross, Eras will beat out Elton John\u2019s Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour for the top spot, which pulled in a total of $887 million in a five-year period between 2018 and 2023./nNew York University Steinhardt\u2019s Music Business Program Director Larry Miller revealed the revenue information, and also discussed the phenomenon that is Taylor Swift, according to CNN Business.  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a global pop artist who faces virtually infinite demand for those tickets,\u201d Miller said. /nAccording to a QuestionPro poll, the average attendee of the Eras tour in the US spent $291.62\u00a0on their own clothing and $214.80 on merchandise purchased after the show. It was revealed that many attendees spent $131.48 on concessions./nJust a few weeks ago, Swift extended the Eras Tour, with new dates popping up in Miami, Indianapolis, Toronto, and New Orleans. \u201cTurns out it\u2019s not the end of an era. Miami, New Orleans, Indy and Toronto: The Eras Tour is coming to you in 2024 with [Gracie Abrams],\u201d Swift wrote on Instagram./nWestern Washington University Professor Jackie Caplan-Auerbach released collected data that showcased that the applause and excitement exhibited by Swift fans at a recent show in Seattle caused activity similar to a small earthquake, according to\u00a0CNN. \u201cFor Taylor Swift, I collected about 10 hours of data where rhythm controlled the behavior,\u201d Caplan-Auerbach told the publication. \u201cThe music, the speakers, the beat. All that energy can drive into the ground and shake it./n\u201cI grabbed the data from both nights of the concert and quickly noticed they were clearly the same pattern of signals. If I overlay them on top of each other, they\u2019re nearly identical,\u201d Caplan-Auerbach added. \u201cWhat I love is to be able to share that this is science.

[+] hosted by Z100 New York and presented by Goldfish Puffs at Madison Square Garden on December 12, 2014 in New York City.  (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for iHeartMedia)/nTaylor Swift is currently juggling various projects and accomplishments while simultaneously looking towards the future. Amidst her ongoing The Eras Tour, the sales of her latest album, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), are thriving, and her single \"Cruel Summer\" is looking to claim the top spot on the Hot 100 chart. Despite these impressive feats, one of Swift's most prominent singles is staging a remarkable resurgence./n\"Blank Space,\" a signature hit from Swift, is making an unexpected and intriguing comeback, gaining momentum gradually yet consistently. The song is undergoing a resurgence in popularity that has taken many by surprise, leaving the potential for its growth virtually limitless./nLast week, \"Blank Space\" reappeared on the Hot 100 chart at No. 49. Billboard's regulations usually prevent tracks that have spent a certain number of weeks on the chart from making a return unless they regain enough popularity to secure a place within the top half. Consequently, when a song is eventually removed from the list or naturally falls off, it typically remains absent from then on./n\"Blank Space\" defied these odds, and it didn\u2019t stop there./nRemarkably, within just one week after its reappearance, \"Blank Space\" has climbed a few notches to reach No. 46 on the current Hot 100. All indications suggest that this upward trend could persist in the forthcoming weeks, allowing the song to continue its ascent./nThe resurgence of \u201cBlank Space\u201d can be attributed to Swift\u2019s announcement that her next re-recorded album will be the iconic 1989. This pop blockbuster propelled \"Blank Space\" to the forefront as its second single, eventually hitting No. 1 on the Hot 100./nSwift's dedicated fans swiftly flocked to the original album following the mid-concert announcement of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), catapulting it back into the top 10 of the Billboard 200 ranking. Evidently, among all the tracks on the title, \"Blank Space\" has gained the favor of the masses. With a surge in streams and purchases of the song, coupled with what must be at least a noticeable number of radio programmers reintroducing it into their rotations, \"Blank Space\" has exceeded expectations, securing a place on the Hot 100 one again./n\"Blank Space\" has already achieved the remarkable milestone of being certified eight times platinum, reflecting the fact that it has moved eight million equivalent copies in the United States alone. Given its current trajectory, it's entirely plausible that \"Blank Space\" could achieve diamond status by reaching the 10 million equivalent units mark in the coming months./n"

    "content": "Inglewood, CA - August 07: Taylor Swift performs during The Eras Tour at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood ... [+] Monday, Aug. 7, 2023.  (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift\u2019s \u201cCruel Summer\u201d is one of the hottest songs in America right now. It\u2019s been living inside the top 10 on the Hot 100 for months, and it keeps approaching the summit, coming tantalizing close to the No. 1 spot. Whether the tune will reach the peak position or not is yet to be seen, but whether it does or doesn\u2019t, the track\u2019s legacy is already cemented due to its near-unprecedented success at radio./nInitially released in 2019 as part of Swift's album Lover, \"Cruel Summer\" was intended to be a single from the pop record. The singer never got to realize those plans at the time, as the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic forced a change of course. Swift embarked on her highly anticipated The Eras Tour in 2023, and it was during this trek that the song experienced a resurgence, breaking free from the confines of being only a fan favorite./nThe song's revival was nothing short of remarkable. It swiftly climbed the streaming charts, catching the attention of Swift and her team. Against all expectations, \"Cruel Summer\" was officially released as a single, four years after its initial drop. Its impact was immediate, with the song ascending to the upper echelons of the Hot 100 and earning a spot in the top 10./nIts Hot 100 presence is impressive, but the true measure of the song's success lies in its dominance on Billboard's radio charts. The single has become a historic win on most of the pop-focused tallies, breaking records and proving Swift\u2019s dominance...and doing so as an incredibly unlikely win, to boot./n\"Cruel Summer\" achieved the remarkable feat of becoming Taylor Swift's twelfth No. 1 hit on the Pop Airplay chart, which tracks the most popular tunes at pop radio in the U.S. With this latest win, she surpassed the records of other chart-toppers like Maroon 5, Katy Perry, and Rihanna, making Swift the reigning queen of the Pop Airplay list./nBut the accolades didn't stop there. \"Cruel Summer\" also conquered the Adult Pop Airplay chart, which is aimed at more mature listeners. The tune claimied the No. 1 spot and marking Swift's eleventh leader on this particular chart. In fact, she holds the record for the most No. 1 hits among all soloists in the history of the Adult Pop Airplay chart, trailing only Maroon 5's record of 15 No. 1s./nIn October 2023, the song achieved another milestone by topping the overall Radio Songs chart. This list ranks songs across genres, making Swift's eight chart-toppers\u2014including \u201cCruel Summer\u201d\u2014on this ranking all the more impressive. With this latest smash, she now claims fourth place among all acts for the most No. 1 hits on the Radio Songs tally and became the third-highest-ranking woman, breaking her tie with Katy Perry./nWhile \"Cruel Summer\" may not have claimed the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 chart as some had hoped\u2014at least not yet\u2014the decision to release it as a single proved to be a smart move. The song not only performed exceptionally well, likely justifying the investment, but it also propelled Swift to historic heights and new records on various Billboard charts./nIn the grand scheme of Swift's illustrious career, \"Cruel Summer\" stands as an unlikely and remarkable triumph. Even if it never ascends to the top of the Hot 100, its legacy is secure./n"

    "content": "\n\t\t\t\tAll five vault track titles for '1989 (Taylor's Version)' were revealed on Sept. 20. Here's everything we know so far about the highly-anticipated album.\t\t\t/n\nFind Out\n/n/nTaylor Swift took the stage in Los Angeles on Aug. 9 for her Eras Tour and confirmed that her next album, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) will be coming out on October 27. Over a month later, Taylor revealed all five of her vault track titles after she had fans unscramble word clues on Google. The singer has been gifting fans with new and never-before-heard music like crazy over the last few years, and she doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down anytime soon. In three years, she\u2019s released three brand new albums (Midnights, Folklore and\u00a0Evermore), as well as three re-recorded versions of her old albums\u00a0Fearless, Speak Now and\u00a0Red, so she can reclaim the rights to them.\u00a0Although\u00a0Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) just came out on July 7, Taylor is already diving into the next era./nThe timing of making the 1989 announcement was too perfect, as Taylor closed out the first U.S. leg of her Eras Tour on Aug. 9, which just so happens to be 8/9.\u00a0The concert wrapped a six show run at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. Because of this milestone, coupled with the \u20188/9\u2019 date, fans were wondering for weeks if the singer would be announcing 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) at the show \u2014 and she delivered. Earlier this year, she confirmed the release date for\u00a0Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) at a different Eras Tour concert./nOfficial album cover for \u20181989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u2019 out October 27. pic.twitter.com/LaCjouiwua/n\u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) August 10, 2023/n/nHere\u2019s everything we know about 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) so far/nThe release date for 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) is October 27, 2023. Ahead of the announcement, Taylor dropped plenty of hits that it would be the next of her six re-recorded albums to come out. On July 7, she released the music video for her\u00a0Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) song \u201cI Can See You,\u201d and it concluded with a BIG\u00a01989 Easter egg. As Taylor drove away at the end of the video, there was a sign above a bridge that said \u201c1989 TV.\u201d Fans took this as Taylor\u2019s way of letting them know that\u00a01989 would be coming next./n1989 was the fifth album in Taylor\u2019s original repertoire and there have also been plenty of \u201c5\u201d hints recently. In the \u201cI Can See You\u201d video, five security guards chased down\u00a0Joey King and\u00a0Taylor Lautner as they tried to rescue Taylor and symbolically help her reclaim her work. Back in October, when Taylor released the music video for \u201cBejeweled,\u201d her character rode an elevator and got off on floor 3 first (signifying album 3,\u00a0Speak Now, as the next release). However, she then rode the elevator up to floor 5, hinting that album 5, 1989, would be after that./n/nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)/n/nThe music video for \u201cKarma,\u201d which was released in May 2023, also provided a\u00a01989 hint. At the time of its premiere, the date for\u00a0Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) had already been announced, so there was no more hints needed about that record. The \u201cKarma\u201d video featured Taylor posing as a statue with the roman numeral MCMLXXXIX written on it. Yes, this translates to \u20181989.\u2019/nThen, at the August 9 show of her Eras Tour in Los Angeles, she made multiple changes to the set that further hinted at the 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) release. During the show, she rocked four never-before-worn outfits, and they were all blue. During the Speak Now, Folklore and\u00a01989 eras, as well as for the surprise songs of the evening, Taylor\u2019s looks were different than we\u2019d ever seen before, as they were all blue for the first time. It wasn\u2019t coincidental, either, because it coincided with the announcement!/nWith all of her re-records, Taylor has included new versions of every original track from the records, so the first part of the tracklist is easily predictable. Although 1989 hasn\u2019t come out yet, fans have gotten a sneak peek at what to expect, as Taylor has dropped the re-recorded versions of \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d and \u201cThis Love\u201d already./nThe fun doesn\u2019t end there, though. She\u2019s also dived back \u201cinto the vault\u201d of songs that didn\u2019t make each album the first time around. Taylor re-recorded these (mostly) never-before-heard vault tracks from each era, as well, and included those on the Taylor\u2019s Versions of her albums.\u00a0Fearless (TV)\u00a0and Speak Now (TV) both had six vault tracks, while\u00a0Red had seven, as well as three other tracks that weren\u2019t on the original version of\u00a0Red. Ahead of the\u00a01989 (TV) release, Taylor\u2019s website confirmed that there would be five vault tracks on the\u00a01989 re-record, in addition to the 16 songs from the original album./nTaylor revealed all five of the vault tracks with help from Google on Sept. 20. The \u201cSwifties\u201d were challenged with an internet scavenger hunt where they had to unscramble word clues to uncover the titles of four of the vault tracks. Those four songs were revealed to be \u201cIs It Over Now?\u201d, \u201cNow That We Don\u2019t Talk,\u201d \u201cSay Don\u2019t Go,\u201d and \u201cSuburban Legends.\u201d Taylor revealed that the fifth vault track is called \u201cSlut!\u201d/nHere\u2019s the full track list for 1989: Taylor\u2019s Version:/nAs always, we have to reiterate that Taylor never confirms who her songs are about. However, there are plenty of hints that point to\u00a0Harry Styles being her main muse for the\u00a01989 album. The two dated in 2012 and beginning of 2013, which lines up perfectly with the Oct. 2014 release date of 1989. One of the most obvious references, of course, is track three, \u201cStyle,\u201d which is a literal play on Harry\u2019s last name./nThe songs \u201cI Know Places\u201d and \u201cOut Of The Woods\u201d both tell a similar tale about a relationship that seems like it could be doomed from the start. However, the song\u2019s subjects are willing to fight the scrutiny to try to make it work, even if they know it will end badly. Unsurprisingly, Taylor and Harry were the subject of intense media attention during their relationship, and were constantly trying to get away from the eyes that were on them. \u201cOut Of The Woods\u201d actually makes two VERY direct references to Harry, as Taylor sings about his \u201cpaper airplane\u201d necklace and the stitches he got on his forehead after a snowmobiling accident when they were together./nMeanwhile, \u201cAll You Had To Do Was Stay\u201d and \u201cI Wish You Would\u201d reference the ending and reconnecting in a relationship. In the former, Taylor calls out her lover for leaving her and then trying to come back into her life. But, in the latter, after some time has gone by, she admits that she wishes he would be part of her life again. This reflects the on and off cycle of Taylor and Harry\u2019s relationship, as it\u2019s rumored that they had a fling in early 2012 before publicly getting together at the end of that year. On \u201cThis Love,\u201d she sings about resurrecting an old romance, as well./nThese days, Taylor and Harry are on great terms. They were even seen chatting at the Grammy Awards in both 2023 and 2021. Some fans are even speculating that Harry could pop up as a featured artist on one of the\u00a01989 vault songs!/nOf course, not all of the songs are about Mr. Styles! \u201cBad Blood\u201d was written about a feud with\u00a0Katy Perry, but the ladies have since squashed their beef. \u201cBlank Space\u201d is a play on all of the media attention that Taylor\u2019s love life gets, and her way of mocking the fake stories about her romances. The album\u2019s lead single, \u201cShake It Off,\u201d is a dance track, where Taylor sings about shaking off her haters. Meanwhile, \u201cYou Are In Love\u201d was inspired by Taylor\u2019s co-writer,\u00a0Jack Antonoff, and his relationship with\u00a0Lena Dunham (the two have since broken up)./n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaylor Swift's Hottest Performance Looks: Photos Of The Singer Onstage\t\t\t\t\n"

Basically, \"Ring Around the Rosie (Taylor's Version).\"/nJust goes to show what everyone sorta anticipated with this concert flick -- namely, it was going to become a full-blown event ... with people screaming/singing at the top of their lungs./nAs far as money, the numbers have been great so far on opening day -- domestically, it's already raked in $39 million between Thursday and Friday screenings ... and at the moment, the 'Eras Tour' film is on pace to make anywhere from $90-$109 mil through Sunday./nIt's an astonishing feat ... and yet another testament to the power of Taylor.

One of these visuals prominently featured a lifeguard shack positioned against a beach backdrop, cleverly emblazoned with the words \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d This visual breadcrumb is hard to dismiss and immediately sent fans's excitement soaring./nIn Swift\u2019s universe, every detail carries significance, and the date of the culmination of the first American leg of The Eras Tour is no exception. The date, 8/9, holds some purpose as the last two digits of the year 1989. While this connection might seem tenuous to some, Swift's history of incorporating cryptic clues into her work lends credence to the notion that there's more than meets the eye. She has hinted with less in the past./nSwift's recent actions have only fueled the speculation surrounding 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). Just weeks ago, as she promoted her latest re-release, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), she unveiled a music video for the track \"I Can See You.\" The visual featured a getaway car cruising beneath a sign that conspicuously read \"1'-9'' 8.9tv.\" The appearance of the numbers 1989 is noteworthy, but Swift aficionados sense that the inclusion of \u201cTV\u201d is simply too deliberate a nod, as it is a commonly-used abbreviation for Taylor\u2019s Version./nThe re-recordings saga still has three more albums left before Swift is done. She has already released Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version), Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) and most recently, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version). All three have quickly ascended to the summit of the Billboard 200 chart and become both commercial and critical triumphs./nWhile Swift has not outlined a specific timeline for the rollout of the remaining trio of re-recordings, her swift progress thus far suggests that her dedication to the project remains resolute. She likely wants to wrap this up, and she\u2019s already doled out two projects in 2021, so doing so in 2023 wouldn\u2019t be too odd./nWhile it is entirely plausible that she will unveil news of 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) during the show, she could just as well keep her audience and the world guessing. Swift's fondness for dropping meticulously crafted Easter eggs lends itself to the possibility that these hints may be a playful diversion or, conversely, a carefully woven tapestry of hidden meanings./nOnly time will unravel the truth, but with two tracks from 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) already out and a tapestry of suggestions coming from either Swift herself or those around her, the prospect of the album's imminent announcement seems to grow more plausible by the moment./n"

    "content": "If the nominations for the 66th Grammy Awards make anything clear, it\u2019s this: When music\u2019s highest honors are handed out in February, the winner of the most-coveted prizes will be either a female act \u2014 or Jon Batiste./nWomen thoroughly dominate the major all-genre categories in nominations announced Friday by the Recording Academy, with work by female vocalists and musicians nabbing seven of the eight nods each for album, record and song of the year, and women taking more than half of the slots in best new artist./nSZA, the witty and adventurous R&B singer known for her frank depiction of millennial romance, leads the field with nine nominations overall, including for album of the year (for her smash \u201cSOS\u201d) and record and song of the year (for her No. 1 single, \u201cKill Bill\u201d). Behind her with seven nods each are Phoebe Bridgers, whose supergroup rock band Boygenius is up for album of the year (for \u201cThe Record\u201d) and record of the year (for \u201cNot Strong Enough\u201d), and the ascendant R&B singer-songwriter Victoria Mon\u00e9t, who scored nominations for record of the year (for \u201cOn My Mama\u201d) and best new artist, among other prizes./nAdditional artists with multiple nominations include Batiste, the jazz and R&B composer known to TV viewers as the former bandleader from \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d along with pop superstars Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo and Miley Cyrus, songwriter/producer Jack Antonoff and country singer-songwriter Brandy Clark, all of whom have six apiece. Serban Ghenea, one of pop\u2019s most in-demand engineers, tied Bridgers and Mon\u00e9t with seven nominations./nIn a telling demonstration of where much of music\u2019s energy resides these days, Batiste is the only male artist up for the album and record awards with his \u201cWorld Music Radio\u201d LP and his single \u201cWorship,\u201d respectively. Batiste, whose \u201cWe Are\u201d took album of the year in 2022 in an upset victory over Swift and Rodrigo, is nominated for the song prize, as well, for \u201cButterfly\u201d \u2014 the only tune in that category performed by a man. The other LPs nominated for album of the year (the Grammys\u2019 equivalent of best picture) are Swift\u2019s \u201cMidnights,\u201d Cyrus\u2019 \u201cEndless Summer Vacation,\u201d Rodrigo\u2019s \u201cGuts,\u201d Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s frisky R&B set \u201cThe Age of Pleasure\u201d and \u201cDid You Know That There\u2019s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd\u201d by the critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey./n\u201cWomen had dang good music \u2014 some of the biggest records of the year and the biggest songs,\u201d Recording Academy chief executive Harvey Mason Jr. said in an interview. \u201cAnd our voters were obviously moved by a lot of it.\u201d/nMason assumed his role in 2021, pledging to diversify both the academy\u2019s executive ranks and its voting membership of more than 11,000 recording industry professionals in response to longstanding criticism that the organization overvalued the work of older white men. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely made huge strides, and it\u2019s having an impact on who\u2019s getting nominated,\u201d he said./n Music /nWhile country and regional Mexican music both enjoyed record-breaking chart success this year, there\u2019s little acknowledgement of those genres in the top categories./nNov. 10, 2023/nThe remaining nominees for record of the year \u2014 which goes to performers and producers, while song of the year recognizes songwriters \u2014 are Cyrus\u2019 \u201cFlowers,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cWhat Was I Made For?,\u201d Rodrigo\u2019s \u201cVampire\u201d and Swift\u2019s \u201cAnti-Hero,\u201d each a monster hit on streaming platforms and Top 40 radio. (Compare \u201cFlowers\u2019\u201d 1.5 billion Spotify streams to the 1.2 million for Batiste\u2019s \u201cWorship\u201d to get a sense of Grammy voters\u2019 fondness for his feel-good messaging and his old-fashioned musical know-how.)/n\u201cFlowers,\u201d \u201cWhat Was I Made For?,\u201d \u201cVampire\u201d and \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d are all nominated for song of the year as well, along with Del Rey\u2019s \u201cA&W\u201d and Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cDance the Night,\u201d which like the Eilish tune originated in director Greta Gerwig\u2019s blockbuster \u201cBarbie\u201d movie. Swift\u2019s nod for \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d brings her career nominations in the song category to seven \u2014 more than anyone else has earned in Grammy history. A win by Swift for album of the year at the upcoming ceremony, set for Feb. 4 at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles, would be her fourth, breaking her current tie with Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon and Stevie Wonder./nIt would also cap a year in which Swift has been the most inescapable story in pop music as a result of her record-breaking Eras tour \u2014 a show Mason compared to \u201cgoing to see LeBron James play basketball\u201d \u2014 and the smash concert film that accompanies it. This week Swift notched the largest opening sales week of her career with her rerecorded version of her 2014 album \u201c1989.\u201d/nRecordings eligible for the 66th Grammys had to be released between Oct. 1, 2022, and Sept. 15, 2023. After two years in which the academy selected 10 nominees for each of the top four categories, the organization lowered the number to eight for February\u2019s show, a rule change Mason attributed to members who felt the higher number was \u201cclouding the field and maybe diluting\u201d the honor of a nomination./nFor best new artist, Mon\u00e9t will compete against a fellow R&B vocalist in Coco Jones, who got her start as an actor on the Disney Channel; the other nominees are rapper Ice Spice, singer-songwriters Gracie Abrams and Noah Kahan, dance artist Fred Again and a pair of Nashville acts in Jelly Roll, who this week won the Country Music Assn.\u2019s new artist prize, and the husband-and-wife duo the War and Treaty./n Music /nThe 2024 Grammy nominations were revealed today, in 94 categories. SZA leads the field with nine nominations. /nNov. 10, 2023/nGiven the huge year country music has had on the charts, it\u2019s not shocking to see more than one country act in the running for best new artist for just the third time this century. Yet country hitmakers including Luke Combs, Zach Bryan and Lainey Wilson were left out of the Grammys\u2019 top categories, scoring nods only for the ceremony\u2019s various country awards. Morgan Wallen, whose \u201cOne Thing at a Time\u201d is 2023\u2019s biggest commercial hit of any genre, received no nominations for the third year in a row, though the songwriters of his Hot 100-topping \u201cLast Night\u201d were recognized in the country song category./nMason said he was \u201creally surprised\u201d by the lack of high-level nominations for country artists. \u201cAnd for Latin, which continues to have massive commercial and critical success,\u201d he added. Many observers expected Peso Pluma, one of the young stars of the booming regional Mexican music scene, to be nominated for best new artist; instead, he got only a single nod, in the m\u00fasica Mexicana album category for \u201cG\u00e9nesis.\u201d The m\u00fasica urbana category features just three nominated works \u2014 Rauw Alejandro\u2019s \u201cSaturno,\u201d Karol G\u2019s \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito\u201d and Tainy\u2019s \u201cData\u201d \u2014 because, the academy noted, it received fewer than 40 submissions for the award. /n\u201cThat tells us we need to continue to develop our membership \u2014 to continue reaching into those communities and getting more voters,\u201d Mason said./nRap was also largely overlooked for major prizes, in part because established Grammy faves such as Kendrick Lamar, Lil Nas X and Cardi B didn\u2019t release albums during the eligibility window. Lamar is nominated for rap performance with \u201cThe Hillbillies,\u201d a single by his duo of the same name with his cousin Baby Keem. For rap album, Travis Scott\u2019s streaming hit \u201cUtopia\u201d will vie against Killer Mike\u2019s \u201cMichael,\u201d Metro Boomin\u2019s \u201cHeroes & Villains,\u201d Nas\u2019 \u201cKing\u2019s Disease III\u201d and \u201cHer Loss\u201d by Drake and 21 Savage./nThe race for producer of the year, non-classical, will pit Jack Antonoff \u2014 who won in 2022 and again at the most recent Grammys thanks to his work with Swift and Del Rey, among others \u2014 against Dernst \u201cD\u2019Mile\u201d Emile II, Hit-Boy, Metro Boomin and Daniel Nigro. The nominees for songwriter of the year, non-classical, which was awarded for the first time this past February, are Edgar Barrera, Jessie Jo Dillon, Shane McAnally, Theron Thomas and Justin Tranter./nThe category of audio book, narration and storytelling recording is a jumble of boldfaced names, with nods for Meryl Streep, William Shatner, Rick Rubin, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama./nA number of classic-rock icons turned up in specialty categories like historical album, in which Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cFragments \u2014 Time Out of Mind Sessions (1996-1997): The Bootleg Series, Vol 17\u201d is nominated, and music film, for which director Brett Morgen\u2019s David Bowie movie \u201cMoonage Daydream\u201d will compete against \u201cI Am Everything,\u201d a documentary about Little Richard directed by Lisa Cort\u00e9s. The Rolling Stones scored a nod for \u201cAngry\u201d in the rock song category, which also includes Foo Fighters\u2019 \u201cRescued,\u201d Boygenius\u2019 \u201cNot Strong Enough,\u201d Queens of the Stone Age\u2019s \u201cEmotion Sickness\u201d and Rodrigo\u2019s \u201cBallad of a Homeschooled Girl.\u201d /nBoygenius, in which Bridgers is joined by fellow singer-songwriters Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, garnered additional nominations for rock performance, alternative music performance and alternative music album, making it the most-nominated act in the traditionally male-dominated rock and alternative fields./nThe nominations, which were revealed in a livestreamed event on Friday, come just two days after an unnamed female musician filed a lawsuit against former academy head Neil Portnow, whom she said drugged and raped her in a New York hotel room in 2018. Portnow, who denies the accusations, stepped down as chief executive in 2019 after he was widely condemned for saying that women in music should \u201cstep up\u201d in order to be recognized for awards such as the Grammys./nPortnow\u2019s departure set off turmoil within the academy including the hiring and quick firing of the group\u2019s next leader, Deborah Dugan, who said she was ousted for calling attention to a variety of financial and ethical violations inside the organization. Mason, who declined to comment on the allegations against Portnow, took over on an interim basis in 2020 before being officially appointed the following year./nBig winners at the 65th Grammys included Harry Styles, whose \u201cHarry\u2019s House\u201d took album of the year; Lizzo, whose \u201cAbout Damn Time\u201d won record of the year; Bonnie Raitt, whose \u201cJust Like That\u201d was named song of the year; and jazz singer Samara Joy, who won best new artist./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

Since no train actually stops at SoFi, two free shuttles took passengers directly to the concert venue from a train station. One ran from the K (Crenshaw) Line\u2019s Downtown Inglewood Station. The other ran from the C Line\u2019s Hawthorne/Lennox Station. The shuttles will run 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. before each show, and for 90 minutes after the concerts./nBut the two shuttles were not full Thursday and the line to get on board the K Line at the Downtown Inglewood Station was nearly empty around 5 p.m., as extra accommodations went unneeded./nRows of security tape forming snaking lines before the shuttles became merely decorative as buses came and went with space inside to spare.

    "content": "LOS ANGELES - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift wins the award for Album of the Year at THE 63rd ANNUAL GRAMMY\u00ae ... [+] AWARDS, broadcast live from the STAPLES Center in Los Angeles, Sunday, March 14, 2021 (8:00-11:30 PM, live ET/5:00-8:30 PM, live PT) on the CBS Television Network and Paramount+. (Photo by Cliff Lipson/CBS via Getty Images)/nWhat makes a release the album of the year is completely up to interpretation by Grammy voters, and that\u2019s what has made it so difficult to predict in the past few years. The trophy has gone to some surprising titles and artists recently, but there aren\u2019t too many shocks in the field this time around./nBut who will end up winning isn\u2019t clear, and that may be where the shock lies./nThis nomination might be more surprising if Jon Batiste hadn\u2019t not only broken into the Album of the Year field two years ago, but won the prize in a stunning upset with his previous offering We Are. Now he\u2019s back with Marc Whitmore, an engineer/mixer who also won for We Are./nProducer and songwriter Jon Bellion earns his third Album of the Year nomination, while engineer/mixer Laura Sisk nabs an incredible three nods this year (also with frequent collaborator Taylor Swift and Lana Del Rey), increasing her career total to seven nominations in this group./nWorld Music Radio stands as Batiste\u2019s second-highest-charting album on the Billboard 200, thanks in large part to his newfound popularity following his previous Album of the Year win. The set peaked at No. 104 on the tally./nIt\u2019s rarely seen these days, but everyone who is nominated for working on Boygenius\u2019 The Record appears in the Album of the Year category for the first time. That includes not only the three women who make up the alternative rock band, but also all the producers, mixers and engineers./nWhile she was never nominated for her own work, Miley Cyrus actually appears in the Album of the Year field for the second time. She was previously up for the honor\u2013one of her two early Grammy nods \u2014 as a featured act on Lil Nas X\u2019s Montero./nNow, her recent top 10 title, which benefits immensely from its lead single \u201cFlowers,\u201d brings plenty of others back to the field./nPerhaps most notably, Mike \u201cSpike\u201d Stent, the mixer/engineer, collects two more Album of the Year nods this time around, hitting 10 total chances to win\u2013including with Olivia Rodrigo as well. Producers Kid Harpoon and Mike Will-Made-It are back for the third time, with Harpoon having won alongside Harry Styles for Harry\u2019s House. Songwriter Michael Pollack is also a three-time nominee./nProducer and songwriters Tyler Johnon and Gregory Aldae Hein collect their second nominations, as does mastering engineer Joe LaPorta, who\u2019s also a Record of the Year nominee as well./nAs a lead artist, Lana Del Rey has now been nominated for Album of the Year twice, but her total count is up at three, as she was one included as a featured name on The Weeknd\u2019s Beauty Behind the Madness. Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd may very well be the longest title to be featured in this category, and it was also Del Rey\u2019s milestone tenth top 10 on the Billboard 200./nProducer Jack Antonoff is nominated against himself this year\u2013also with Swift\u2013and now he\u2019s landed eight Album of the Year nods. Michael Harris, the engineer/mixer, is back for a second time./nThis is a bit of a surprise. Janelle Mon\u00e1e is adored by critics, but even the most ardent supporters likely had a tough time suggesting that this album was a success. The title came five years after her last full-length, Dirty Computer, which was also nominated for Album of the Year, but it didn\u2019t make the same impact. The set peaked at No. 17 and quickly faded away, but clearly not in the minds of voters./nThe Age of Pleasure actually marks Mon\u00e1e\u2019s third Album of the Year nod, as she was featured on fun.\u2019s Some Nights, which, coincidentally, marked Antonoff\u2019s first chance to win as well. Now they\u2019re nominated against one another./nThe most-nominated person on this project is mastering engineer Dave Kutch, who collects his ninth Album of the Year nod. Amazingly, he\u2019s never won./nMick Guzauski, one of the mixers/engineers, returns for a fifth Album of the Year nomination. He\u2019s been working for decades, and he first appeared in this vertical in 2000 with the Backstreet Boys\u2019 Millennium. /nFellow collaborators Nate \"Rocket\" Wonder and Nathaniel Irvin III double their Album of the Year nod count thanks to working with Mon\u00e1e again, as they were up for the honor with Dirty Computer./nOlivia Rodrigo and her songwriting partner and producer Dan Nigro have now worked on two albums together, and both were up for this Grammy. Guts was even bigger than the singer\u2019s debut, and it went right to No. 1. It followed closely in sound from her debut, Sour, which turned out to be a smart move on her part. That title also earned Mitch McCarthy, one of the engineers/mixers on Guts, a nod as well./nWhile Rodrigo and Nigro may still be relatively new to this category, Guts also features some very seasoned vets. Serban Ghenea hits 20 Album of the Year nominations with his two chances to win this year, including Swift\u2019s Midnights. Randy Merrill, the mastering engineer, is also nominated for both Guts and Midnights, increasing his career total to 12 Album of the Year nods./nSpeaking of Midnights, of course it\u2019s here! The full-length stood out as one of the biggest releases of 2022, and it\u2019s continued to perform incredibly well throughout 2023. Critics and fans alike adored the No. 1 bestseller, which spun off 10 top 10 hits \u2013 all at the same time, by the way./nSwift has now been nominated for Album of the Year six times, and she\u2019s already won in half of those instances \u2014 an incredible track record./nThe superstar is joined by talents who have been here many times before, including more than once this year, like the previously named Antonoff, Merrill, Sisk and Ghenea. Also, Mixer/engineer Mikey Freedom Hart collects his third Album of the Year nod, while Sean Hutchinson, Ken Lewis and Evan Smith, who are credited in the same capacity, are back for a second time\u2013with most of them having debuted in this category with Swift./nSZA is a first-time nominee as an artist, as her No. 1 SOS, is a serious contender for the prize. The R&B was separated by many years from her debut, and it turned out to be well worth the wait. The singer has been nominated as a featured guest on Doja Cat\u2019s Planet Her, as the two sent \u201cKiss Me More\u201d into the Hot 100\u2019s top 10./nProducers and songwriters Rob Bisel and Carter Lang return for a second go at the Album of the Year Grammy, while mastering engineer Dale Becker nabs his second nod in this category./n"

    "content": "Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, eager to demonstrate her Big Labor bonafides, really stepped in it with her recent call on singer Taylor Swift to postpone planned concerts in Los Angeles to appease a hotel workers union./nAccording to Politico, Kounalakis signed a letter signed by Democratic politicians like Asm. Isaac Bryan of Culver City \u2013 best known for his recent opposition to categorizing human trafficking of minors for sexual purposes as a \u201cserious\u201d crime \u2013 and Sen. Dave Min of Irvine \u2013 best known for his recent drunk driving arrest \u2013 calling on Swift to \u201csupport\u201d striking hotel workers by putting off shows which begin Thursday./n\u201cHotel workers are fighting for their lives. They are fighting for a living wage. They have gone on strike. Now, they are asking for your support,\u201d the lawmakers breathlessly wrote in the letter. \u201cSpeak Now! Stand with hotel workers and postpone your concerts.\u201d/nFor related news, see: Politicians urge Taylor Swift to postpone LA concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers/nHow, exactly, this would help the cause of hotel workers is a mystery. But it would certainly punish music fans looking for entertainment. This is understood by at least one Democrat, Sen. Josh Becker, who tweeted, \u201cThis seems like a bad idea to me. So many people have bought tickets, some overpaying on the resale market. Clearly we can find other ways to support the strikers that don\u2019t dash the dreams of young fans who have been so looking forward to this concert.\u201d/nAlas, considering the union and politics involved, reason is too much to ask for./nFor related news, see: Taylor Swift should ignore the hollow hysterics of Unite Here Local 11 and continue shows as normal/nThe union, Unite Here Local 11, has been known throughout Southern California for trying to force hotel establishments into unionization. One of its leaders is Ada Briceno, who happens to also be a leader of the Orange County Democratic Party./nClearly, Kounalakis is trying to gain favor with the union and virtue signal to other unions since she is now also running for governor of California. As far as we can tell, Kounalakis\u2019 most notable interaction with unions traces back to her 2019 arrangement of having unions help pony up hundreds of thousands of dollars to refurbish her office./nNow, she is illogically calling on Taylor Swift to punish her fans to somehow show support for union activists. In a wonderful demonstration of hypocrisy, Kounalakis joins this call despite having just attended a Taylor Swift show herself, according to Politico./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nThis editorial board regrets this poorly thought out political stunt from Kounalakis and notes her hypocritical approach to politics. California needs better leadership and it\u2019s not going to get it from politicians like Kounalakis who throw logic out the window to appease hysterical unions."

    "content": "Jung Kook (Big Hit Music)/nJung Kook's debut album Golden has earned a strong start on the Billboard charts this week, marking another significant milestone in his career. While the title has already secured a place in music history, it narrowly missed breaking an all-time record that, for a while at least, seemed within reach./nGolden makes its debut at No. 2 on this week's Billboard 200 chart, which monitors the most-consumed albums and EPs in the United States. This placement is particularly noteworthy, as it represents Jung Kook's first appearance on the Billboard 200 outside of his work with BTS./nGolden starts in the runner-up position with an impressive 210,200 equivalent album units. This figure includes 122,000 pure sales, with the remainder primarily comprising streaming equivalent units. The No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 is held by Taylor Swift's 1989 (Taylor's Version) for the second consecutive week, as it moved another 245,000 equivalent units\u2014significantly lower than its debut week, when it exceeded 1.6 million units./nJung Kook came close to becoming the first South Korean musician to achieve a No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. However, he narrowly missed this distinction by just a few thousand equivalent units, with Swift refusing to give up her control over the top spot./nAs Golden starts in the runner-up rung, Jung Kook is now the fourth member of BTS to debut an album at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. Amazingly, this marks the fourth instance of this showing in 2023 alone, following Suga, Jimin, and V, who all similarly barely missed securing the top spot./nWhile Golden didn't quite manage to surpass 1989 (Taylor's Version) on the Billboard 200, it still represents a significant win for Jung Kook and South Korean artists in general. It is now tied as the highest-charting album in U.S. history by a soloist from the Asian nation./nAdditionally, the album has been highly successful in terms of individual songs. Golden produced a Hot 100 No. 1 hit with \"Seven,\" featuring Latto, and the follow-up single, \"3D\" with Jack Harlow, debuted at No. 5 on the same chart. Jung Kook's new single, \"Standing Next To You,\" is also expected to make a high debut on the Hot 100, potentially landing inside the top 10./n"

Nationally, a female got paid 83 cents for every $1 a man got./nSo where\u2019s the best place for female workers, looking at this compensation chasm? Women in Rhode Island earn 92% of men. That\u2019s followed by Delaware at 91% and Wisconsin at 89%. Lows? Utah and Wyoming at 75%./nOver the five years tracked, however,\u00a0California\u2019s gap narrowed by only 0.2 percentage points, ranking No. 32 and trailing the 1.3-point improvement nationally. The divide shrank in 32 states./nLeading the pack was Wisconsin, which shrank its gap by 11 points. Connecticut\u2019s gap contracted 10.4 points and Rhode Island 7.2. The lowest contractions were found in New Mexico where its gap widened by 7 points, followed by Arizona up 5.8, and Indiana up 5.1./nLet\u2019s start with job counts because the opportunity to get a paycheck is just as critical as the pay itself./nCalifornia employed the most women \u2013 5.6 million in 2021, 11% of the nation\u2019s 51 million. Next came Texas (4.5 million), Florida (3.5 million), New York (3 million), and Illinois (2 million)./nBut\u00a0California\u2019s female share of jobs was sixth-lowest at 43% vs. 45% nationally. Tops were the District of Columbia at 50%, then Mississippi at 49%, and Virginia, Delaware and Louisiana at 48%. Lows? Idaho at 41%, then Wisconsin at 42%./nOr look at women\u2019s job growth over five years. California ranked No. 29 at 3% vs. 5% nationally. Women in 41 states enjoyed gains./nTops were Utah at 23%, then Arizona at 18%, and Idaho at 17%. Lows? Hawaii saw female workers dip by 6%, then New York and Wisconsin, were off 5%./nThe pandemic business limitations varied widely across the nation in 2021. So, I also looked at the job-growth gap between women and men./nCalifornia female workers fared much better with their job growth topping men by 5.4 percentage points. That was 16th best among the states and topped the 2.9-point women\u2019s advantage nationally. Female job growth topped males in 40 states./nTops? Utah\u2019s job growth for women bested men by 18 percentage points, then came Nevada at 13, and Wyoming at 11. Lows? Wisconsin, where women fared 12 points worse, then Indiana, off 7 points, and Minnesota, off 6./nNow let\u2019s talk weekly earnings./nCalifornia ranked No. 9 at $1,020 vs. $912 nationally. Tops? D.C. at $1,565, then Massachusetts at $1,157, and Maryland at $1,134. Lows? Mississippi at $722, then Oklahoma at $738, and South Carolina and West Virginia at $756./nCalifornia women\u2019s pay rose 25% in five years, No. 8 among the states and topping 22% growth nationally./nEvery state had female pay raises, topped by D.C.\u2019s 40%, then Rhode Island at 38%, and Wisconsin at 29%. Lows? West Virginia and South Carolina at 10%, and Arizona at 12%./nAnd ponder the wage gap another way: 2016-2021 earnings improvements by gender./nCalifornia ranked No. 32 for women\u2019s raises vs. men \u2013 only 0.2 percentage points better vs. a 1.9 gap nationally. Among the states, 32 had large pay hikes for women vs. men./nTops? Wisconsin women enjoyed pay gains 16 points better than men, then Connecticut at 15 points, and Rhode Island at 11. Lows? New Mexico women trailed men by 10 points, then Arizona and Indiana with 8-point disadvantages./nWomen are clearly closing the compensation gap./nIn the entertainment world, singer Swift\u2019s tour may sell $1 billion worth of tickets \u2013 perhaps making it the music industry\u2019s largest take. \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2013 a film about women empowerment that\u2019s directed by a woman, a sad Hollywood rarity \u2013 is setting some movie industry box-office records./nAnd in everyday life,\u00a0California women seem to fare relatively well on these national yardsticks for pay and job opportunities./nTo qualify that outperformance, when these nine wage-related gradings were averaged, California ranked No. 10 among the states./nThe top five are Connecticut, Washington, Rhode Island, Virginia and Nevada. Bottom five: Alaska, New Mexico, Indiana, West Virginia and Minnesota./nOh, and California\u2019s big economic rivals?

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nFootball fans mingled with Swifties, on public transit, in the parking lot and at the game. Everyone was dressed for the occasion./nBy Alyson Krueger/nPhotographs by Sara Naomi Lewkowicz/nIt was a standing-room-only crowd gathered in the aisles of a New Jersey Transit train from New York\u2019s Penn Station to New Jersey at 5 p.m. on Sunday evening./nMultiple groups of friends were overheard asking the same question: Was this because of Taylor Swift?/nBy now most Americans are well-versed with the Ms. Swift effect. Wherever she goes, whether it\u2019s to perform or even just eat dinner, fans follow. Once word leaked that she might make an appearance at MetLife Stadium for a football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the New York Jets to cheer on her rumored new boyfriend, Kansas City\u2019s All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce, it was assumed the crowds would show up en masse. The fact that tickets to the game and Mr. Kelce\u2019s jersey \u2014 he sports No. 87 for the Chiefs \u2014 showed notable increases in sales (and cost), according to multiple media outlets, only confirmed those suspicions./nMs. Swift did indeed show up at the game and watched it from a private suite with friends Sophie Turner, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Hugh Jackman. People in the stadium who were close enough to see the celebrities spent much of the game gawking and taking photos. (Ms. Swift waved to fans multiple times.)/nOn the train, two Jets fans couldn\u2019t believe their good fortune. \u201cWe have four season tickets, and we sold two for $90,\u201d said Michael Callaghan, 30, who lives in Kips Bay. \u201cThey were going for $50 before Taylor was going.\u201d/n\u201cWe should get Swift bracelets that say Jets on them,\u201d quipped his friend, Ryan Dwyer, 36, who lives on the Upper West Side./nAt Secaucus Junction, where travelers from Penn Station have to transfer to get a train to the Meadowlands, strangers were joking with one another about whether they were fans of football or Ms. Swift./nWhen Elaine Gitles, 26, who works for a software company and lives in the East Village, was showing off her red T-shirt that said \u201cTravis Kelce is Hot,\u201d an older man in a green Jets jersey yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s a great Taylor Swift jersey.\u201d/nMs. Gitles clarified that she\u2019s a Chiefs fan, and she bought the shirt when her team won the Super Bowl last season. But she\u2019s not mad about being labeled a Swiftie (as Ms. Swift\u2019s fans are nicknamed), since she is one of those as well./n\u201cI went to Eras three times,\u201d Ms. Gitles said of Swift\u2019s wildly successful Eras Tour. \u201cIt\u2019s the best coincidence of all time that my favorite musical artist is joining the best football team of all time.\u201d (She also shared the lyrics she came up with that Ms. Swift could sing if her relationship to Mr. Kelce falls through: \u201cHe played the field like he played me. A travesty.\u201d)/nOther people who stopped to chat in Secaucus were Hana Kim, 24, and Courtney Takahashi, 25, both special education teachers in Westchester. The duo couldn\u2019t afford tickets for Ms. Swift\u2019s concert at the MetLife Stadium in May, so they sat in the parking lot outside the stadium and listened to the whole thing from their cars instead. \u201cWe Taylorgated,\u201d said Ms. Takahashi./n\u201cWe bought football tickets as soon as the news came out,\u201d said Ms. Takahashi. \u201cI don\u2019t even care if we see her. Just being in her presence, breathing the same air, feeling her vibe, that is good enough for me.\u201d/nOutside the stadium, as some fans were tailgating with grills and coolers of beer, others were brainstorming the best way to get a peek at Ms. Swift./n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking at social media, waiting to see if we could see which box she was in and if we could see her,\u201d said Shae Mermis, 33, who lives in Crown Heights and was at the game with her girlfriend and parents./nStella Fee, 44, and her daughter, Zoe Fee, decided they would hang out on the V.I.P. level. \u201cWe are season ticket holders in the level below, so we are allowed to go up a floor to where the boxes are,\u201d she said./nFans had varying ideas for appropriate game day outfits./nAs soon as she saw Ms. Swift in Mr. Kelce\u2019s box last week at the Chiefs game in Kansas City, Caye Schnackel, 26, a fashion designer who lives in Brooklyn, decided she and her boyfriend would have to dress as the celebrity couple for Halloween. \u201cI looked at him and said, \u2018I am going to be Taylor, and you are going to be Kelce,\u2019 and that was that,\u201d she said./nShe found the perfect outfit at Nova Lee Boutique \u2014 a bright red jersey with 87 written on it, made entirely of sequins \u2014 and had it overnighted so she could get it in time to wear to Sunday\u2019s game in addition to Halloween./n\u201cI\u2019m just so obsessed with Travis now,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so jealous of Taylor. I am going to try and win him over today.\u201d (Her boyfriend, Krzysztof Miezgiel, who was next to her, just laughed.)/nSean Patrick, 47, went to a T-shirt printing company at a local mall the morning of the game to try and get the saying, \u201cWhere\u2019s Taylor?\u201d printed, but he was told it wouldn\u2019t be ready in time. His friend, Tom Wagner, 59, from Manahawkin, N.Y., went to Walmart and bought the largest pink sweatshirt he could find but it still didn\u2019t fit. So they decided to take pink masking tape, write phrases about Taylor Swift on it with a marker, and attach them to football jerseys./nThe pair spent four hours tailgating in the parking lot, making pulled pork and chicken on four different grills and watching other football games on a television they set up with a portable satellite dish. \u201cWe had about 50 people come up to us and ask to take photos,\u201d said Mr. Wagner. \u201cI\u2019ve never had more fun at a Jets game in my life.\u201d/n\u201cThe atmosphere is crazy,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a team bring a crowd like this.\u201d/nAdvertisement"

That\u2019s a very small sum, considering she\u2019s sent a total of 212 tracks to the tally throughout her time in the spotlight.

Seeing how well it\u2019s still doing, it\u2019s likely that next week, \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d will still be able to find space on the chart. When it does, the Midnights single will break its tie with \u201cTeardrops on My Guitar\u201d and match \u201cLove Story\u201d as one of Swift\u2019s second-longest-charting smashes./n"

    "content": "Travis Kelce has been the best tight end in the NFL for the better part of a decade. He has helped turn the Kansas City Chiefs into a modern-day NFL dynasty, serving as the main target for superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes en route to winning two Super Bowls since 2020. The dynamic duo has become the gold standard across the league./nStill, the 34-year-old Kelce has never been bigger than he is right now. His budding romance with singer Taylor Swift has skyrocketed his stardom over the past month. As well known as Kelce already was in the sports world, some would say Swift truly put him on the map./nThe reaction speaks for itself. In the aftermath of Swift attending a home game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City last month, Kelce\u2019s jersey sales spiked nearly 400 percent. She made another appearance at a road game at MetLife Stadium in New York last week and the cameras panned to her suite more than a dozen times. The main storyline this week with the Vikings set to host the defending Super Bowl champions is whether Swift is going to show up at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis./nThe hysteria has gotten so out of hand that Kelce recently admitted that he thinks the NFL has gone overboard with its coverage of his relationship with Swift./nWhat does Vikings tight end T.J. Hockenson think of the attention his good friend has been getting?/n\u201cHe always gets a lot of attention,\u201d Hockenson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything has changed.\u201d/nHe paused./n\u201cOK,\u201d Hockenson said. \u201cMaybe a little more off the field.\u201d/nMeanwhile, the Vikings are prepared to give Kelce his fair share of attention on the field./n\u201cEvery single snap, first, second and third down, Travis Kelce is dangerous,\u201d Vikings head coach Kevin O\u2019Connell said. \u201cYou have to know where he is, and there\u2019s a great chance wherever he is, the intent of the play is probably to involve him in a pretty significant capacity.\u201d/nThe biggest thing that separates Kelce from everybody else who plays the position is his ability to freelance. A common joke around the NFL is that the 6-foot-5, 250-pound tight end sometimes doesn\u2019t even run routes. He simply searches for an open space while running downfield./nAsked about defending Kelce over the course of a game, Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores noted that it\u2019s imperative to keep eyes on him until the whistle blows the play dead./n\u201cHe\u2019s certainly among the best tight ends to probably ever play,\u201d Flores said. \u201c\u201dIf somebody has him leveraged out, he\u2019s going to stop the route and go somewhere else where he can get open.\u201d/nIt helps that there\u2019s something otherworldly about the way Mahomes goes about his business, extending plays with his legs long enough for Kelce to get open, then zipping the ball in there at the last second./n\u201cYou\u2019ll see Trav sit in a zone and then he\u2019ll see Patty move his feet and he\u2019s like, \u2018Alright, I\u2019m going to go over here,\u2019 \u201d Hockenson said. \u201cHe does a lot of stuff that\u2019s just really cool to watch.\u201d/nThere isn\u2019t a perfect way to defend that combination. Frankly, even if the Vikings dial up the perfect call, they might still end up giving up a big play because the rapport Kelce has with Mahomes is on another level./n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard,\u201d Vikings safety Josh Metellus said. \u201cWe might think we have it shut down and they find a way to make an even bigger play out of nowhere.\u201d/nIt\u2019s important that the Vikings don\u2019t let those plays compound on defense./n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to move on to the next play,\u201d Flores said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the mindset we\u2019ve got to take.\u201d/nAs somebody who plays the same position, Hockenson has tried to emulate his game after Kelce over the years./n\u201cHe\u2019s just such a great player,\u201d Hockenson said. \u201cI could go off on a tangent about all the things that he does. He varies his speeds. He sees the defense. He does some stuff at the top of the route.\u201d/nDoes he have any tips for how the defense should cover him?/n\u201cIt\u2019s easier for me to say than it is for them to guard,\u201d Hockenson said with a laugh. \u201cYou can kind of try to help out a little bit, but it\u2019s not like I know exactly what Trav is doing on certain plays.\u201d/nWhich is exactly why the Vikings will be giving Kelce so much attention on the field. As for the attention off the field, that will hinge on whether Swift shows up to cheer him on./n\u201cThat would be cool,\u201d Vikings cornerback Byron Murphy said. \u201cNot for him, though, because we\u2019re going to try and get our hands on him in front of her.\u201d/nThat might be easier said than done."

[+] \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at Foro Sol on August 24, 2023 in Mexico City, Mexico. (Photo by Hector Vivas/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTaylor Swift has been releasing her re-recorded albums for nearly two years now, and there is now a tried-and-true formula she follows. The singer has been fairly consistent when it comes to the manner in which she promotes these sets, and it\u2019s worked brilliantly. But with her forthcoming drop, she might want to reconsider how she\u2019s been doling out the tunes and aim for more major hits./nFor the first three of her re-recorded album releases, Swift has largely\u2014but not entirely\u2014stayed away from promoting singles with traditional campaigns. Sometimes she\u2019d share a tune or two before a full-length appears, but most of the music is only available once the full package hits. In less than two months, Swift will return with 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), the slightly reworked take on her pop album 1989. The set is scheduled to drop in late October, which isn\u2019t very far away, even if it feels that way to Swifties. Now would be a great time to mix things up./n1989 was Swift\u2019s biggest album when it comes to singles. The title produced three No. 1 hits on the Hot 100, with \u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cBlank Space,\u201d and \u201cBad Blood\u201d all rising to the top spot. Two other cuts, \u201cStyle\u201d and \u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d also found their way into the top 10 on the tally. Many of these cuts rank among her most popular and highest-certified, having moved millions upon millions of copies./nAnticipation for the reworked versions of many of these singles is high, and Swift could capitalize on that excitement if she wanted to. Instead of dropping all those tunes at once when 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) is made available as a full collection, she could share them one at a time. That plan would allow fans to rush to support each one individually, perhaps helping them perform better in their short windows of exclusivity./nSwift could potentially hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 twice with the same song but under slightly different titles. Tracks like \u201cShake It Off\u201d and \u201cBlank Space\u201d are still performing well to this day, so if Swift pushed her massive fan base to stream and buy the retitled versions, they could also soar to the summit. She proved she could earn a No. 1 with a re-recording when \u201cAll Too Well\u201d finally hit the top spot on the Hot 100 after being extended, renamed and re-released. So why shouldn\u2019t the same be possible with tunes that were even more popular?/nThis plan could also work for those 1989 tunes that weren\u2019t No. 1s in a past life. \u201cStyle\u201d has already been surging in terms of sales and streams since Swift announced 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), so perhaps that\u2019s next in line to go to No. 1 on the Hot 100. Plenty of other cuts from the set were also fan favorites, and in their re-recorded forms, they might rise even higher than they did originally, as much has changed in the near-decade since 1989 took over the world./nIf Swift does want to produce a number of major hits, one at a time, from 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), she should start soon. The set is coming in less than two months, so she wants to give each one at least a week in which to rack up enough streams and sales to conquer the Hot 100, or at least debut high before she moves on to the next. This plan could help her increase her career totals of placements inside the highest reaches of the chart, but it also comes with some downsides./nCurrently, Swift is busy trying to send her current single \u201cCruel Summer\u201d to the highest rung on the Hot 100. The song is living inside the top 10, where it has remained for weeks. New tunes keep beating the cut to the summit, but there\u2019s no telling what\u2019s in store for the coming frames./nIf it takes another few weeks to push that electro cut to the summit, she might not want to split attention and go for another leader from 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). In essence, it\u2019s possible that the slow rise of \u201cCruel Summer\u201d may stop some promotional plans around 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), though there\u2019s no telling what Swift is planning at the moment./n"

The singer-songwriter is used to topping the weekly tallies, especially when she has something new to share. What is somewhat shocking this time around is just how massive her latest offering is when compared to every other album in America./nSwift\u2019s 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, the weekly ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. The title opens with more than 1.653 million equivalent units shifted, with many of those being actual purchases./nIt\u2019s only clear how massive that sum really is when compared to other, much smaller numbers.

From the moment the five-plus minute song came out, fans were instantly transported into the history of one of Taylor\u2019s past romances. Like with most of Taylor\u2019s songs, \u201cAll Too Well\u201d was based on a true story from her life, but the specificities in the lyrics took things to a level that no other Taylor song had gone to before./n/n\u201cAll Too Well\u201d [was difficult to write emotionally] because it took me a really long time to filter through everything I wanted to put in the song without it being a 10 minute song, which you can\u2019t put on an album,\u201d Taylor explained in 2012. \u201cI wanted a story that could work in the form of a song and I called my co-writer LizRose and said, \u2018Come over, we gotta filter this down.\u2019 And it took me a really long time to get it.\u201d/nTaylor first released \u201cAll Too Well\u201d on her album\u00a0Red in 2012 and it was instantly a fan favorite. \u201cIt was a day when I was just, like, a broken human, walking into rehearsal, just feeling terrible about what was going on in my personal life,\u201d Taylor said on\u00a0Rolling Stone\u2019s 500 Greatest Albums podcast in 2020. \u201cI just started playing four chords over and over again and the band started kicking in. People just started playing along with me, I think they could tell I was really going through it. I just started singing and riffing and ab-libbing this song that basically was \u201cAll Too Well.\u201d It literally just was that song, but it had probably seven extra verses and it included the f-word.\u201d/nThis wasn\u2019t the first time that it had been publicly revealed that \u201cAll Too Well\u201d was originally much longer than the 5 minutes and 29 seconds that fans heard on\u00a0Red. For years, Swifties begged Taylor to release the full, ten-minute version, and in 2021, they finally got their wish. At the end of 2020, Taylor began the process of re-recording her first six albums so she could earn the rights to the songs. In addition to re-recording all the original songs, Taylor also included previously un-released songs that didn\u2019t make the albums the first time around. When she dropped\u00a0Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) in Nov. 2021, that included the full, 10-minute version of \u201cAll Too Well.\u201d/n/nTaylor did this as a gift to her fans, who helped the song take on a life of its own over the years. Taylor even performed \u201cAll Too Well\u201d at the 2014 Grammy Awards, despite the fact that it was never a single. \u201cIt\u2019s fun when things surprise you like that,\u201d she admitted. Taylor wrote \u201cAll Too Well\u201d when she was in one of her most heartbroken states, but has said that the song now brings her joy because of the way her fans have reacted to it./nIn addition to dropping a 10-minute audio version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d in Nov. 2021, Taylor also released a short film for the song. The film stars\u00a0Dylan O\u2019Brien and\u00a0Sadie Sink in the lead roles, with Taylor also popping in at the end for a surprise appearance. She performed the full 10-minute version on\u00a0Saturday Night Live in an unprecedented performance, as well./nIt\u2019s no secret that Taylor wrote \u201cAll Too Well\u201d about her brief relationship with\u00a0Jake Gyllenhaal. Even though Taylor has never explicitly said this herself, there are many, many hints that point to Jake. The very first clue was in Taylor\u2019s album liner notes for Red. Back in the day, Taylor used to capitalize certain letters in the lyrics that were written out in the liner of her records. The capitalized letters always spelled out a hidden message that was meant to give more insight into who or what the song was about. For \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d the liner note was \u201cMaple Lattes.\u201d When Taylor and Jake were dating, they were photographed carrying coffee cups while strolling around New York City, and a coffee shop employee confirmed to\u00a0People at the time that they ordered specialty maple lattes during their visit to the store on Thanksgiving Day 2010./nOf course, the song was also released on the first album Taylor dropped following her breakup from Jake. Many of the songs on\u00a0Red are seemingly about the handsome actor. However, \u201cAll Too Well\u201d tells the full story of the pair\u2019s relationship, and the 10-minute version adds even more insight./nThe very first verse of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d references the Thanksgiving that Taylor and Jake spent together in 2010. After getting maple lattes, they spent the holiday with his sister,\u00a0Maggie Gyllenhaal,\u00a0in Brooklyn. \u201cI left my scarf there, at your sister\u2019s house and you still got it, in your drawer, even now,\u201d Taylor sings, referencing the black scarf she was wearing that day. The \u201cscarf\u201d has become an important symbol for Swifties./nIn the second verse, Taylor continues, \u201cYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,\u201d and yes, Jake did have glasses when he was a kid \u2014 we\u2019ve seen the photos to prove it! In the 10-minute version of \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d Taylor gives another direct hint about Jake, singing, \u201cYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine, and that made me want to die.\u201d The exes have a nine-year age gap. She referenced their ages again later in the song, adding, \u201cI was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes, I get older but your lovers stay my age.\u201d Jake\u2019s current girlfriend,\u00a0Jeanne Cadieu, is only 26 years old./nThe 10 minute version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d also references Brooklyn, where Taylor spent a lot of time with Jake. She also sings about the song\u2019s subject missing her 21st birthday party, and Taylor turned 21 amidst her relationship with Jake. Another\u00a0Red song, \u201cThe Moment I Knew,\u201d is about this specific heartbreak, as well./nTaylor and Jake first dated for three months between October 2010 and January 2011. She was 20 and he was 29 when they first got together. The two were first linked when they were spotted at Saturday Night Live together in Oct. 2010. Although the two mostly kept their relationship out of the public eye, they were photographed strolling around New York City together on Thanksgiving 2010. Taylor was also seen with Jake\u2019s sister, Maggie, on the holiday. Reports of their breakup first surfaced in Jan. 2011, with\u00a0Us Weekly reporting, \u201cJake just told her it wasn\u2019t working out. Taylor is really upset and hurt. She feels really burned by him.\u201d/nHowever, the \u201cAll Too Well (10 Minute Version)\u201d lyrics reveal that Taylor and Jake tried to secretly reconnect a few months after breaking up. \u201cYou never called it what it was, \u2019til we were dead and gone and buried, check the pulse and come back swearin\u2019 it\u2019s the same, after three months in the grave,\u201d Taylor sings on the song. Later on, she croons about how Jake didn\u2019t want anyone to know about how they were giving things another go. \u201cThere we are again when nobody had to know, you kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath,\u201d she reveals./nRed also featured the song \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d which is also speculated to be about Jake. The song title says it all, with the lyrics telling the story of an ex who wants to get back together time and time again \u2014 only, finally, the narrator is no longer having it. This tracks with the theory that Taylor and Jake had gotten back together before she called it off for good./nIn February 2022, Jake addressed \u201cAll Too Well\u201d for the first time. \u201cIt has nothing to do with me,\u201d he told\u00a0Esquire. \u201cIt\u2019s about her relationship with her fans. It is her expression. Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don\u2019t begrudge anyone that.\u201d Despite his level-headed response, Jake also made sure to reference the hate he\u2019d been getting from Taylor fans over the years. \u201cAt some point, I think it\u2019s important when supporters get unruly that we feel a responsibility to have them be civil and not allow for cyberbullying in one\u2019s name,\u201d he said. However, he also made it clear that his life had not been threatened by Taylor\u2019s fans./nMeanwhile, during a 2017 interview on Watch What Happens Live, Maggie was asked if she still had Taylor\u2019s scarf at her house. \u201cI never understood why everybody asked me about this scarf,\u201d Maggie admitted. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u00a0Andy Cohen explained the situation, and Maggie still played coy. \u201cI am in the dark about the scarf,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally possible. I don\u2019t know. I have been asked this before.\u201d Of course, a deeper read of the lyrics reveal that it\u2019s JAKE who is supposed to have the scarf (in his drawer), not Maggie!/nDuring a 2013 interview, Taylor also revealed Jake\u2019s reaction to the\u00a0Red album in general. Although she didn\u2019t name him directly in the interview, it\u2019s widely theorized that her quote was about him, due to most of the album being about him. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I just listened to the album and that was a really bittersweet experience for me. It was like going through a photo album,'\u201d Taylor recalled. \u201cThat was nice. Nicer than, like, the ranting crazy e-mails I got from this one dude.\u201d/n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJake Gyllenhaal -- PICS\t\t\t\t\n"

He called it a \u201clife-changing\u201d amount of money that far exceeds the standard bonus his truckers usually get./n\u201cThe typical amount is $5,000 to $10,000 each. So this large amount is unbelievable,\u201d he told CNN./nHe said his drivers were shocked when they read the amount on their cheques, adding that this kind of money could help his employees put down payments on houses or set up college funds for their kids./n\u201cLook, fair wage doesn\u2019t put you in a position to buy a home. But this opens up that possibility,\u201d Scherkenbach said./nThe bonuses were handed out during what was supposed to be a routine meeting ahead of one of Swift\u2019s L.A. shows. Scherkenbach said he was going over the rundown for the week when Swift\u2019s father, Scott Swift, made a surprise visit./n\u201cScott gave a speech saying that he had discussed this with Taylor and they thought that it was only right that everybody received a bonus. Taylor insisted on writing a handwritten note to each driver and (added) a wax seal on the envelope with her monogram,\u201d he recounted./n\u201cThe drivers didn\u2019t want to be overly rude and look at it. But one looked and thought it said $1,000, another driver saw it as $10,000 and then the third said \u2018Well this has to be a joke!\u2019\u201d Scherkenbach said./nBut the US$100,000 bonus was no joke, and each cheque and thank you note came with a corresponding tax document./nWhile the bonus may seem outsized, so, too, are the sacrifices that Scherkenbach\u2019s truckers made to work this job./n\u201cThese men and women, they live on the road. They sleep during the day and work all night,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gruelling task. They leave their families, young children for weeks. For Taylor\u2019s tour, they\u2019ve been away from home for 24 weeks.\u201d/nBut the force of Swift\u2019s dollars haven\u2019t just been felt by workers, but also the locations to which she\u2019s brought the Eras tour./n\u201cAt this point, Taylor Swift is basically her own economy,\u201d as one Vanity Fair writer puts it./nThe impacts of her tour have been felt in every city she has stopped at, selling out stadiums, gracing fans with a 44-song set list spanning her nearly two-decade-long career and injecting millions of dollars into local economies with the gravity of her star power./nIn a Federal Reserve report published in July, the agency found that \u201cMay was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the onset of the pandemic, in large part due to an influx of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the city.\u201d/nPerforming just two shows in Colorado led to a US$140-million boost to the state\u2019s GDP for the year, according to a report from the Common Sense Institute./n\u201cThe totality of Taylor Swift\u2019s U.S. tour could generate $4.6 billion in total consumer spending, larger than the GDP of 35 countries,\u201d the report states./nGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing national stories delivered to your inbox every weekday./nGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing national stories delivered to your inbox every weekday."

Ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?CHANG: But you know another thing bringing in megabucks for Swift? The nearly three-hour-long concert film of her tour out last month.

Mia Galuppo wrote about it for The Hollywood Reporter.MIA GALUPPO: It's a situation where there's a lot of money to be had. It's a space that hasn't really been looked into much by artists because it hasn't really been embraced by exhibitors, by Hollywood. But as with anything, where Taylor Swift goes, many people follow.

So I'm just thinking, yeah, OK. She is also a huge global economic force like Taylor Swift. I guess my question is, is there even space for smaller or lesser-known artists to come out with concert films, or do you have to be a mega-huge star to draw people out to theaters?GALUPPO: No, you don't have to be, you know, this Beyonce- or Taylor Swift-level star, which, you know, are two of the top recording artists of all time. I was talking to the head of the National Association of Theater Owners. He made a great comparison where, just as at the summer box office, you see the blockbusters, you know, the Marvels of the world, you also see those independent films that still make a lot of money.CHANG: Well, what about artists who are no longer alive? Like, I noticed you wrote in your piece there might be a 1970s David Bowie concert film coming to theaters soon. How big of a draw is archival stuff like that these days?GALUPPO: A really interesting thing happened recently with the film \"Stop Making Sense,\" which is the Talking Heads film that was recently rereleased by A24. Sixty percent of that opening weekend audience was actually under the age of 35, which means that the majority of that audience that was going to see that film wasn't even born when the Talking Heads were a band. They had disbanded by that point. So it's really fascinating. And that movie did incredibly well at the box office. So there is this market there which exhibitors are trying to say, please make more of this type of film because audiences, as evidenced by something like \"Stop Making Sense\" or Taylor Swift...CHANG: Yeah.GALUPPO: ...Are going to show up to the theaters.CHANG: But are these new concert films that are coming out more of the same? - because, I mean, way before Taylor, there was already a pretty large canon of concert films, from Aretha Franklin to Led Zeppelin, from Prince to the Talking Heads, as you mentioned. Is there anything that sets Taylor Swift's film apart that maybe would signal a new direction for this whole genre?GALUPPO: Yes, definitely. One of my sources who has been in the concert and live performance film space for a long while said a very interesting thing, which was concert films were ruined by poor execution. The technology just wasn't there. It was a situation where you set up three cameras. You were looking at the stage. And that's not a very cinematic experience.CHANG: Yeah.GALUPPO: For \"The Eras Tour,\" which filmed over multiple nights at her SoFi Stadium tour here in Los Angeles, it employed a small armada of cameras and cameramen.CHANG: How many are we talking?GALUPPO: We are talking upwards of 40, according to reports.CHANG: Wow.GALUPPO: And this is including not just stationary cameras but drones and cranes. You know, this is a situation where the barrier to entry for that technology has lowered for artists, and you are able to create an incredibly cinematic experience. And that is something...CHANG: Yeah.GALUPPO: ...That - you know, when I was there for the opening weekend of \"The Eras Tour\" in theaters, that's something that, you know, fellow moviegoers told me was so exciting to them - is it was the closest thing to being there without being there. It is that communal cinematic experience that is beautiful on its own.CHANG: Mia Galuppo is a film writer at The Hollywood Reporter.

    "content": "PARK CITY, UT - JANUARY 23:  Singer Taylor Swift is seen on Main Street during the Sundance Film ... [+] Festival on January 23, 2020 in Park City, Utah.  (Photo by Mat Hayward/GC Images)/nIt looks like Taylor Swift may be on her way to another No. 1 hit on the Hot 100. The superstar\u2019s single \u201cCruel Summer\u201d has been gaining ground in the past few days when it comes to sales and streams, and the tune is still performing especially well at radio in the U.S. All three of those consumption metrics feed into the Hot 100, and with \u201cCruel Summer\u201d improving or holding steady in all three areas, it seems likely that the tune will soar to the summit on the most competitive songs chart in America in just a few days./nWhile all signs point to \u201cCruel Summer\u201d becoming the next No. 1 on the Hot 100, nothing is certain until Billboard announces the winner in a few days. Swift still faces competition from some major players in the industry and some huge hits, and anything can happen. So, who does Swift have to beat to conquer the Hot 100 again?/nDrake currently rules the Hot 100 with his new No. 1 debut, \u201cFirst Person Shooter.\u201d The latest focus track from his new album For All The Dogs opened atop the tally as the full-length tops the Billboard 200. The song is the rapper\u2019s lucky thirteenth leader on the tally and the first for featured act J. Cole. \u201cFirst Person Shooter\u201d could conceivably hold onto the top spot, or Drake might actually replace himself at No. 1./nAnother song from For All The Dogs, \u201cIDGAF,\u201d has been gaining in its second week of availability. The track, which features Yeat, opened at No. 2 on the Hot 100, where it sits at the moment. It seems unlikely, but there\u2019s a real chance that \u201cIDGAF\u201d could replace \u201cFirst Person Shooter\u201d on the Hot 100\u2019s throne, making Drake one of a very small number of acts in U.S. history to swap one winner for another./nDoja Cat could also possibly return to the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 with her single \u201cPaint the Town Red.\u201d The tune has already spent several weeks running the show, and it\u2019s the highest-ranking non-Drake smash on the Hot 100. This week, it\u2019s been pushed down to No. 4, so it doesn\u2019t have far to climb once Drake\u2019s For All The Dogs songs descend\u2026if they do descend, that is./nSZA is also looking to snag her third No. 1 hit with \u201cSnooze.\u201d The latest single from her album SOS has come tantalizingly close to the highest rung on the tally, as it\u2019s topped out at No. 2, where it ranked last frame. Once Drake\u2019s new hits step out of the way, as many are expected to after this week, SZA will have another real shot at claiming another champion. Even if \u201cSnooze\u201d doesn\u2019t make it to No. 1 next turn, it\u2019s still one to watch./n"

Jack married\u00a0Margaret Qualley in an intimate ceremony, and Taylor was in attendance to support the happy couple. The 33-year-old was spotted exiting a large white Chevy SUV as she headed into the wedding through a back door, following a suited security guard in video published by Page Six. A glimpse of her baby blue midi-length dress by Erdem could be seen, revealing a spaghetti strap cut and ruffle details, along with a slightly asymmetrical skirt. She kept her hair down and draped over one shoulder as she walked in, also showing off a high pair of stiletto sandals./nIn another, second video published by the outlet, Taylor could also be seen walking with a glass of white wine outside next to pals (and couple) Zoe Kravitz and Channing Tatum./nAfter more than 10 years of a friendship and working relationship, Taylor and Jack have formed an incredibly close bond over the years. The two first met in 2012 and collaborated for the first time on the song \u201cSweeter Than Fiction\u201d in 2013. The song was featured on the\u00a0One Chance movie soundtrack. Following its release, Taylor began working on her fifth studio album, 1989, and tapped Jack as a producer for the project./nJack co-wrote and produced three songs \u2014 \u201cOut Of The Woods, \u201cI Wish You Would\u201d and \u201cYou Are In Love\u201d \u2014 on the record. At the time, he was in a relationship with\u00a0Lena Dunham, and Taylor penned \u201cYou Are In Love\u201d about their relationship. The two broke up in 2018 and Jack started dating Margaret in 2021./nIn 2016, Jack was by Taylor\u2019s side when she took home\u00a0Album of the Year for\u00a01989 at the Grammys. He joined her again for her 2017 album\u00a0Reputation, helping with six tracks on the record. Jack has also collaborated with Taylor on her subsequent albums\u00a0Lover, Folklore (which also won a Grammy for Album of the Year), Evermore\u00a0and\u00a0Midnights. Additionally, he was part of the re-recording process for\u00a0Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version), Red (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u00a0and\u00a0Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version). It\u2019s likely that he was also involved in\u00a01989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), which will come out later this year./nWhen Taylor released\u00a0Midnights in 2022, she wrote an Instagram post about how much it meant to her that she and Jack were still working together after 10 years of friendship. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier that my co-pilot on this adventure was Jack Antonoff,\u201d she gushed. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend for life (presumptuous I know but I stand by it) and we\u2019ve been making music together for nearly a decade HOWEVER..this is our first album we\u2019ve done with just the two of us as main collaborators.\u201d/n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaylor Swift's Hottest Performance Looks: Photos Of The Singer Onstage\t\t\t\t\n"

Madison Avenue, the NFL and Swift\u2019s staff must be staying up late each night coming up with ways to exploit this thing for all it\u2019s worth while it lasts, and apparently they convinced the football gods to play along. Just when we thought that Zach Wilson and the Jets might actually spoil the plot Sunday night, the Chiefs and Kelce pulled out a win./nMemo to Wilson: Shake It Off./nThe NFL is just glad to be in the news for something that isn\u2019t straight from a police blotter or drawing the public\u2019s wrath. After Deshaun Watson and the gambling suspensions and the anthem kneeling and Kaepernick and the wokeness we get, awwww, cute \u2014 the football player and Miss Americana. Kelce has caught the Tay-Bug. How Enchanted. (I hope you appreciate that someone of advanced years managed to pull off allusions to two Taylor Swift songs in one paragraph.)/nHere\u2019s what I think went down when Swift and Kelce went public. Swift met with Roger Goodell at a secret location and laid it out for him: \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, Commish: I\u2019ll bring millions of Swifties to the NFL \u2014 a demographic consisting of females ages 5 to 35 \u2014 and you\u2019ll give me the male NFL audience, plus I\u2019ll get a new song out of it five minutes after the breakup. Meanwhile, we can sell a lot of jerseys and insurance, too.\u201d/nTo which Goodell replied, \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d/nTay Tay is a pop singing sensation of course, but that\u2019s not her greatest talent. Many years ago I participated in an interview with rock legend (and Swift\u2019s namesake) James Taylor, and for some reason someone asked him what he thought of Swift (what?!). Taylor paused a moment and then said, \u201cShe\u2019s a marketing genius.\u201d/nIf Tay Tay is not collaborating musically with James Taylor or Ed Sheeran or John Mayer or Colbie Caillat or Chris Stapleton or the group formally known as The Dixie Chicks or Keith Urban and many many more \u2014 mining new audiences across all genres and eras \u2014 she\u2019s dating them, breaking up with them and writing a song about them \u2014 Joe Jonas, Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Lucas Till, Taylor Lautner, Conor Kennedy, Harry Styles (there were many more listed on the internet, but I lost interest). Now it\u2019s Kelce (and, by extension, the NFL)./nTay Tay is a force of nature. You think Kelce is a big deal, sports fans? He\u2019s not even in her league. If she were North America, he would be Guam. She can fill football stadiums all by herself (like the Beatles). Let\u2019s see a tight end do that. Maybe no one since the Fab Four has connected with the masses like this woman. Tay Tay could climb to the top of a remote mountain in Peru and run into a Swiftie. She is ubiquitous, appearing in commercials, taking the continent by storm with her ongoing Eras Tour (68 shows this year, ticket sales expected to surpass $2 billion), cooperating for a documentary, smiling her red lipstick on magazine covers everywhere, receiving nonstop media coverage, selling 114 billion albums \u2026 and now she\u2019s cracked the NFL market. Heaven help us./nThe last two weekends she showed up in NFL suites cheering on her flame with the Kelce family and friends (what, no Matthew McConaughey!?). She got more airtime than Andy Reid during Sunday night\u2019s Jets-Chiefs game at MetLife Stadium. There was Tay Tay with her arm around Mama Kelce. And there was \u2014 what?! \u2014 Jake from State Farm chatting up Mama K, too. During a commercial break, we saw a bank ad featuring \u2014 who else? \u2014 Taylor Swift, followed immediately by another commercial featuring Chiefs coach Andy Reid, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and our buddy Jake, pitching insurance./nTay-Trav has created the nexus of pop, football and Madison Avenue. Tay Tay couldn\u2019t possibly be more popular so we won\u2019t go there, but internet searches for Kelce\u2019s jersey have increased by 1,267% and searches for Chiefs jerseys and tickets have risen by 1,974% and 1,853% in a week, respectively. The demand for Kelce\u2019s jersey has surpassed that of Mahomes, famous quarterback and pitchman. By the way, Tay-Trav happened just in time to boost attention for the documentary about Kelce, soon to be released./n(If nothing else, this has been a mutually beneficial relationship. Almost makes you wonder if it was, like, you know, totally planned, the latest genius marketing move by Tay?)/nIf (when?) Kelce and Tay Tay split up, Goodell and the insurance people will cry their eyes out. They knew that was the risk All Too Well (get it? \u2014 another Swiftie song! We media types have done a crash course in Swift songs so we can sound hip and clever). The Swifties and NFL fans will be watching to see if Kelce joins a long trail littered with the singer\u2019s former beaus. Cue the music: I Knew You Were Trouble./nKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce reacts during game against the New York Jets, Sunday, Oct. 1, 2023, in East Rutherford, N.J./nAdam Hunger, Associated Press/n"

'cause people from certain angles legitimately couldn't witness much at all -- other than tiny specks down on the ground./nAnd yet, for the Taylor Swift crowd ... even the people who were furthest away seemed to have had a great view of the performance, all because that circular videoboard was turned on./nNow, there's been some speculation as to why this was the case for one and not the other ... and it all has to do with what some claim is SoFi actually charging artists/their touring companies to run and operate those monitors -- and, presumably, it isn't all that cheap./nWe haven't been able to find any definitive evidence that SoFi even charges for this feature, or that the alleged cost is passed on to the artist -- but if that is the case, it's interesting./nThe bigger picture here is that Swifties and Beyhivers continue to be at odds over which star is doing the touring thing better right now, but we won't weigh into all that. No thanks!/nOne last thing ... Chart Data claimed this past week that Beyonce's Renaissance tour had broken a record by becoming the highest-grossing tour by a solo female artist since Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour, raking in $461 million so far. What that report fails to acknowledge, strangely, is that Taylor's Eras Tour has been projected to be in the billions./nIf true, it's unclear how Bey can hold that title ... especially since they're both still going."

Self-interested hotel union Unite Here Local 11./nFor related news, see: Politicians urge Taylor Swift to postpone LA concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers/nIn a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times, the union called on Swift to postpone her show in \u201csolidarity\u201d with striking hotel workers. Several of the union\u2019s elected allies have predictably chimed in, arguing that Swift should respect the union\u2019s cause. Lieutenant\u00a0Governor Eleni Kounalakis was shameless enough to join the protest, despite having just seen Swift in Santa Clara the weekend prior./nNotably missing from the list of boycott endorsers: Inglewood Mayor James Butts, not to mention the countless small businesses and disappointed fans who would lose out if Swift skipped SoFi./nThe union\u2019s demand is an unusual one: Swift herself is not in the middle of a labor dispute. Indeed, Swift made news in recent days by awarding her road crew up to $100,000 each as a personal thank you for the hard work during the tour. She\u2019s also partnered with local\u00a0charitable\u00a0organizations on her tour stops, such as a food bank in Santa Clara./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more pro-worker perspective,\u00a0and seemingly one that Los Angeles would welcome to town./nBut according to Local 11\u2019s twisted logic, Swift is obligated to reschedule because her visiting fans will be staying at LA-area hotels, including some of the hotels where workers may currently be on strike. This selfish perspective is on-brand for Local 11, which in recent weeks has made news for deliberately disrupting a wedding and 4th of July tourism to advance its goals during the strike./nRelated Articles\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tMatt Fleming: Thank you, readers, for reading my columns\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tGiving thanks for all of our freedoms\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tHappy Thanksgiving: Political Cartoons\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tA Thanksgiving lesson from grateful and prepared American families\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tJudge Andrew Napolitano: No one should be thankful for the size and scope of government\t\t\n\nSet aside for a minute the flawed argument that the entire LA economy should suffer because of labor disputes at a handful of union properties. The fault for the ongoing strike lies with union leadership, not the hotels and certainly not the excited Taylor fans coming to Los Angeles. The union has stubbornly prolonged the dispute with demands that hotels support a Los Angeles ballot measure that would require them to house the homeless alongside paying guests./nWith a potential transformation of these hotels into makeshift homeless shelters,\u00a0good luck getting tourists to stay there for Taylor\u2019s next tour stop in Los Angeles./nFor related news, see: Eleni Kounalakis hypocritically calls for Taylor Swift to cancel shows after attending concert/nAlso on the list of demands is a new hotel tax of seven percent, which guests would pay into a trust fund controlled by the union. The union claims the money would go towards affordable housing, but the language of the fund gives it broad latitude to spend the money on \u201cother efforts\u201d as well./nAs of this writing, Swift seems poised to ignore the union\u2019s unreasonable demands, picking the local economy and thousands of fans over the tantrums of Kurt Peterson and his cronies at Local 11. The tour dates will no doubt be a success, and should also serve as a lesson to other celebrities and politicians who face a Local 11 call for a boycott: There\u2019s no harm in shaking off the unreasonable demands of Los Angeles labor unions./nMichael Saltsman is Executive Director at the Employment Policies Institute"

Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift's 1989 (Taylor's Version) is rewriting the record books once again, this time on the vinyl front. The re-recorded version of her pop masterpiece 1989, released just a week ago, has broken the all-time record for the largest sales week on vinyl in U.S. history./nAccording to Billboard, which cites data from Luminate, 1989 (Taylor's Version) achieved the remarkable feat of selling 580,000 copies on vinyl in its first six days of availability. That\u2019s the largest sales week for a vinyl album since Luminate began tracking sales in 1991./nThe previous modern-era vinyl sales record was previously held by Swift, so the singer-songwriter breaks her own record. Before the arrival of 1989 (Taylor's Version), that honor was held by her most recent album of all original material, Midnights. The set sold 575,000 copies in its opening week in late October 2022./nWhat may be even more impressive is that 1989 (Taylor's Version)\u2019s total first-week sales sum isn\u2019t clear just yet. The numbers reported are only as of the first six days the title was available. That 580,000 sum will likely climb, raising the record even higher./nIn the first six days following its release, 1989 (Taylor's Version) sold over 1.1 million copies in the United States alone, including all formats. When considering total equivalent album units earned\u2014including streaming activity as well\u2014that figure climbs to over 1.3 million copies./nOne of the factors contributing to her incredible vinyl success was the variety of vinyl variants offered for 1989 (Taylor's Version). Buyers had the option to choose from several different colors, and it\u2019s likely that many dedicated supporters purchased multiple copies, further bolstering the impressive sales figures./nWith the album's extraordinary sales performance, Swift is poised to score yet another No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. It's virtually guaranteed that 1989 (Taylor's Version) will debut at the top, as it has already moved over one million copies\u2014something almost no one left in the music industry can manage these days. The title will mark her thirteenth chart-topping album, the third-most of all time./n"

On 12 October 2019, Sunrise Records opened The Vault in Birmingham, the largest HMV record store. (photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images)/nAmidst her ongoing whirlwind The Eras Tour and the simultaneous release of multiple singles spanning various albums, Taylor Swift's creative momentum shows no signs of slowing down. Her ability to tantalize fans with teasers and hidden clues has ignited speculation about her next move\u2013including a potential new single from her recent acclaimed release./nAs Swift takes center stage during her residence at Los Angeles's iconic SoFi Stadium, the venue\u2019s official Twitter account extended a warm virtual embrace to the megastar with a series of images. While these visuals depict picturesque California landscapes, it's the subtle details that have ignited a wildfire of speculation among ardent fans./nAmong the images is a depiction of Beverly Hills, complete with an intriguing alteration. A street sign bearing the name \"Bejeweled Drive\" is the focus of the scene. A quick glance at Google Maps reveals that no such thoroughfare exists in Beverly Hills, so it\u2019s not only made up, it\u2019s been concocted for a reason./nSwift's penchant for embedding Easter eggs within her artistry is widely known, and this conspicuous clue has sparked fervent deductions from her devoted followers. It can\u2019t mean nothing. The singer has taught her followers that everything means something./n\"Bejeweled\u201d is one of the songs featured on Swift\u2019s album Midnights, her latest collection of original compositions. The set acme a blockbuster the moment it arrived in late 2022, and since then, it has maintained its status as a bestseller and hit-producer./nMidnights has already produced three singles, with the most recent offering, \"Karma,\" officially receiving the treatment in early May. It\u2019s been months since then, and the Ice Spice-assisted cut is on its way down, so now\u2019s a good time for a new focus. \"Bejeweled\" stands as a strong contender, backed by its status as a fan favorite and its inclusion in her The Eras Tour setlist./nAs Midnights started at the pinnacle of the Billboard 200, \"Bejeweled\" promptly debuted within the top 10 on the Hot 100. It has so far peaked at No. 6 on the tally, and when the CD launched, it was one of 10 top 10 smashes from the set, as Swift ruled the entire highest tier on the ranking at once, a historic first./nAlso embedded within SoFi Stadium's tantalizing tweet were other additional hints. Another image subtly suggested the potential next title in her re-recording plan, 1989 (Taylor's Version). While these breadcrumbs fuel anticipation and plenty of social chatter, Swift's mysterious nature means nothing is certain until she announces it officially./n"

Swift had endured weeks of the NFL sports media, abetted by Kelce\u2019s public statements about having a crush on her, building up to the big moment when he was able to snag a date with \u201cthe hottest girl in school\u201d by just being persistent enough, the writer said./nIn the end, the world may never know whether the romance is real or hype, but one thing is likely. Swift looks happy to fuel the story that she and Kelce are in the preliminary stages of something \u2014 a friendship, a professional collaboration or even an authentic romance./n\u201cTaylor is not seen unless she wants to be seen,\u201d PR exert Melissa DiGianfilippo, president of Serendip Consulting in Phoenix, told the Today show. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t comment unless she wants to be heard. She (was at the game) to support him. That\u2019s admittance enough (of) interest at the very least, or a deeper relationship.\u201d/nDiGianfilippo pointed out that celebrities of Swift and Kelce\u2019s caliber always have ways of being introduced privately to romantic prospects and to conduct these budding relationships out of the public eye. This reality is in contrast to the idea that celebrities\u2019 private lives always are prey to the intrusion of the paparazzi. Indeed, Swift managed to maintain privacy around her romance with actor Joe Alwyn, and she was never spotted publicly with her last rumored boyfriend, provocative rocker Matty Healy./nSwift has been famously vocal about how much she dislikes it when people speculate on her dating life and turn it into \u201ca national pastime\u201d and \u201centertainment,\u201d as she told Rolling Stone in 2014./nSwift most definitely does not like being known for the men she is dating and has \u201cwritten multiple albums\u201d about how relationships are better when they\u2019re kept secret, writer Frankie de la Cretaz wrote on CNN. This writer said that the deluge of podcasts, social media posts and in-game references to Swift\u2019s potential relationship with the Chiefs\u2019 tight end \u201cseems to completely disrespect her wishes and boundaries.\u201d/nOn the other hand, Swift appeared to willingly show up at the Chiefs-Bears game and to be seen leaving the stadium with Kelce, giving fans the \u201centertainment\u201d she expects they desire. Swift has become on of the most media savvy celebrities on the planet, so it\u2019s very likely that her appearance at the game was her way of seizing control of a narrative that began spinning over the summer. That her purpose remains a mystery should fuel people\u2019s fascination even more./nThe romance story heated up in late July after Kelce told his brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, on their \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast, that he tried to meet the singer at one of her Eras Tours concerts, ESPN reported./n\u201cI was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings,\u201d Kelce told his brother. He said he wanted to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it./nThe dating rumors amped up even more when Jason Kelce joked during a Sept. 14 interview on \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d postgame show that the rumors of his brother\u2019s relationship with Swift are \u201c100 percent true.\u201d Even after Jason Kelce emphasized that he was joking, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d ESPN said./nAnother PR expert, Beth Booker, told Today that Swift\u2019s appearance with Kelce has already benefited both their brands, even if the singer can\u2019t get any more popular than she already is. At the very least, the Swift-Kelce show on Sunday boosted sales of Kelce jerseys, with the Associated Press reporting that they are \u201cselling like hotcakes\u201d after Sunday\u2019s game./nDiGianfilippo agreed that there were elements of \u201cintentionality\u201d of the Swift-Kelce show. It was no accident that Swift sat next to Kelce\u2019s mother, or that Kelce wore a tie-dye suit while leaving the stadium with her; his outfit was interpreted to be a riff on Swift\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d album./nRelated Articles\nEntertainment |  \n\n\t\t\t\u2018Nasty and deliberate attack\u2019: Meghan and Harry accused of leaking royal names in race scandal, report says\t\t\n\n\nEntertainment |  \n\n\t\t\tShane MacGowan: Remembering this troubled genius with 5 great songs\t\t\n\n\nEntertainment |  \n\n\t\t\tCalifornia police investigating whether NBA player Josh Giddey was involved in relationship with a minor\t\t\n\n\nEntertainment |  \n\n\t\t\tShane MacGowan, frontman of The Pogues, dies at age 65\t\t\n\n\nEntertainment |  \n\n\t\t\tBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s skin-lightening accusations are the latest she and other stars have dealt with\t\t\n\nBut this \u201cintentionality\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that the connection is fake, even if it appears designed to generate even more hype, DiGianfilippo told Today./n\u201cThere are planned moments that her PR team and manager and probably his thought of to make this even busier,\u201d DiGianfilippo said. \u201cBut I believe these things are always rooted in some truth. It\u2019s real, but they made it better and more interesting.\u201d/nDiGianfilippo said aspects of Swift\u2019s appearance also seem to be \u201cin conversation\u201d with elements of her work, including her choice to wear her signature red lipstick, as she has throughout her Eras Tour, and she and Kelce leaving in \u201ca getaway car.\u201d Swift has always been known to communicate with her fans with \u201cEaster eggs\u201d in her lyrics or in what she says or does during her public appearances./nPut together, DiGianfilippo said these clues indicate Swift is on board with the relationship, or at least with being seen with Kelce. Swift seems to be \u201cin control\u201d of how this narrative is now unfolding, she said./n\u201cShe only does these things when it\u2019s something that she\u2019s excited about or that she\u2019s in control of. It\u2019s right up her alley,\u201d DiGianfilippo said."

Originally, the singer was supposed to head back to the U.S. to spend the big day at home with her family right after her upcoming Eras Tour show in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on November 19, according to Page Six. However, the outlet is now reporting that she is seemingly staying in Brazil after a fan tragically died at one of her concerts./n\u201cThe Brazil concerts \u2026 She is devastated about a fan dying,\u201d a source told the outlet. \u201cThe weather is extreme. It\u2019s a mess she didn\u2019t expect. It\u2019s been a traumatic experience. It\u2019s been a lot. She is going to decide today.\u201d The outlet also reported that her private jet was seen landing in S\u00e3o Paulo on November 21./nHer new Kansas City Chiefs player beau later confirmed that he will be on his own for the holiday while speaking with brother Jason Kelce on their \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast.\u00a0Travis noted that he will \u201cbe feasting on KFC because I won\u2019t have anybody here.\u201d/nTaylor has another show in S\u00e3o Paulo on November 24, the day after Thanksgiving, while Travis is set to play a Chiefs game in Las Vegas on November 26. The busy post-holiday week will most likely prevent them from seeing each other for at least a few days, but they could be right back in each other\u2019s arms as soon as possible./nTravis showed up to one of Taylor\u2019s Argentina Eras Tour shows over the weekend and seemed to thoroughly enjoy the show as he hung out with her dad, Scott Swift, in the VIP area of the venue. The talented songwriter surprised the crowd when she referenced the NFL star by changing a lyric in the song \u201cKarma\u201d from her Midnights album. \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me,\u201d she sang to a blushing and smiling Travis./nThe lovebirds, who first sparked dating rumors over the summer, also made headlines right after the show when Taylor ran up to Travis, who was patiently waiting for her at the side of the stage, and planted a big kiss on him. The sweet couple then walked backstage as many fans cheered. Videos of the memorable moment made their way online and left many supporters gushing over the PDA."

Like every Swift album before and since, \u201c1989\u201d was scrutinized for the slightest hints of sexuality and perceived moral transgression; save for the errant \u201cdamn\u201d and \u201chell,\u201d it was deemed sufficiently \u2014 almost suspiciously, her critics thought, for a woman her age \u2014 clean./nOn a few moments of \u201c1989,\u201d Swift gestured toward the public fascination with her love life (the \u201clong list of ex-lovers\u201d on \u201cBlank Space\u201d; the accusation in \u201cShake It Off,\u201d that she goes \u201con too many dates\u201d). But she kept her language safely PG, and kept her anger, if she had any over the way she was portrayed in the media, buried beneath the surface./nNow in her mid-30s, Swift is revisiting the album that made her a global phenomenon, and with it those five previously unreleased, newly recorded vault tracks. Sonically, they\u2019re more in line with \u201cMidnights,\u201d her moody, verbose 2022 album, than the taut, sparkling pop of \u201c1989.\u201d The standouts are two sharply written, synth-driven relationship post-mortems: the surging \u201cIs It Over Now?\u201d and, even better, the pulsating \u201cNow That We Don\u2019t Talk,\u201d where Swift sizes up an ex with sharp lines like, \u201cI don\u2019t have to pretend that I like acid rock, or that I\u2019d like to be on a mega yacht/With important men who think important thoughts.\u201d/nAnd then there\u2019s \u201c\u2018Slut!\u2019\u201d Those expecting Swift to go full riot grrrl \u2014 like the Bikini Kill frontwoman Kathleen Hanna, who would sometimes perform with that word provocatively scrawled on her stomach \u2014 probably shouldn\u2019t have judged a song by its title. \u201c\u2018Slut!\u2019\u201d is a dreamy, mid-tempo reverie that combines florid, rainbow-hued imagery (\u201cFlamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard\u201d) with moments of casual social commentary (\u201cI\u2019ll pay the price,\u201d she says to a man of their tryst, \u201cyou won\u2019t\u201d). That titular syllable is exhaled breathily on the chorus and later, as the song\u2019s intensity builds, shouted like a slur from the cheap seats. \u201cIf they call me a slut,\u201d she sings, in a love-struck, lavender haze, \u201cyou know it might be worth it for once.\u201d/nThat lyric feels flippant, even half-baked. Though the song is self-aware and occasionally insightful about the double standard Swift experienced as a young woman in the public eye, its edge is blunted by the way it centers the salvation of romance, as if the affection of a decent man \u2014 \u201cIn a world of boys,\u201d Swift swoons, \u201che\u2019s a gentleman\u201d \u2014 can rescue a woman from the systemic scrutiny of sexism./nBut it\u2019s also important to remember where, in 2014, Swift was in her evolution. After distancing herself from the word \u201cfeminist\u201d as late as 2012, she had only recently begun identifying as one, thanks in part, she said at the time, to conversations with her friend Lena Dunham. Two years later, when she shot a video for Vogue\u2019s \u201c73 Questions\u201d series, Swift was asked what advice she had for her younger self. \u201cIf I could talk to myself at 19, I would say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re gonna date just like a normal 20-something should be allowed to do, but you\u2019re going to be a national lightning rod for slut-shaming.\u2019\u201d/n\u201cSlut\u201d was generally the subtext of the way Swift was talked about then, though it was rarely a term hurled explicitly in her direction. Her whiteness protected her from certain kinds of scrutiny \u2014 contrast the perception of Swift with that of Amber Rose, who in 2015 organized her own version of a \u201cSlutWalk\u201d protest in solidarity with survivors of sexual assault \u2014 and she also seemed to have been censoring parts of herself to appeal to the widest possible audience. \u201cShake It Off\u201d may have hinted at the effects of \u201cslut-shaming,\u201d but it was still wholesome enough to appear on the soundtrack of the 2016 animated children\u2019s movie \u201cSing,\u201d in which it was performed by an anthropomorphic pig voiced by Reese Witherspoon./n\u201c\u2018Slut!\u2019\u201d is not a great Taylor Swift song, though it is an interesting one. Given that her more recent work has come to critique and revise the fairy tale stories her music once told, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a song she would have written today. But I prefer it to the \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d of her 2010 song \u201cBetter Than Revenge,\u201d in which a line that was perceived as Swift\u2019s own \u201cslut-shaming\u201d of another woman was replaced with a more benign lyric. For all its messiness, this track feels like a more honest snapshot of who she was at a certain moment in time \u2014 a young woman, wielding words, still figuring it all out./nAdvertisement"

The singer-songwriter has taken her tour to new lengths\u2014and places\u2014by announcing more than a dozen additional shows, bringing the biggest tour in memory to eager audiences across the United States and Canada./nOn Thursday, August 3, Swift surprised her devoted followers with the news of 15 new concerts added to The Eras Tour lineup by posting about it on social media.

The newly added shows are scheduled to take place in October and November of 2024. Registration to learn more and gain early access to ticket purchasing is now open on Swift's official website./nThe inclusion of Canadian stops on The Eras Tour comes as a relief to none other than Canada's Prime Minister. Just last month, he reached out to Swift via social media, expressing his country's desire to host her on the tour. In a tweet, he playfully referenced Swift's own lyrics, saying, \"It\u2019s me, hi. I know places in Canada would love to have you. So, don\u2019t make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon.\"/n"

(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for MTV)/nFour years after it was initially released, Taylor Swift's song \u201cCruel Summer\u201d is proving to be one of the biggest hits of her career. The track, which was chosen as the most unlikely of singles, has been dominating Billboard's Pop Airplay chart for months, and at the moment it shows no sign of stopping. Now, with another week spent at the top, the cut makes history and helps Swift prove once again that she ranks among the most successful women in music history./n\u201cCruel Summer\u201d has now led the charge on the Pop Airplay chart for 10 weeks. Billboard publishes the ranking every week and it lists the most successful tracks at pop radio stations across the U.S. Now that it has collected 10 weeks at No. 1, \u201cCruel Summer\u201d ranks as one of the longest-charting leaders of all time by a solo female musician./nIn fact, Swift is now tied with four other solo women for the fifth-most weeks spent at No. 1 on the Pop Airplay chart. She is currently on the same level as Dionne Farris (\u201cI Know\u201d), Mariah Carey (\"We Belong Together\") and Miley Cyrus (\u201cFlowers\u201d), who joined this list earlier this year./nThree solo female musicians have managed to keep a song at No. 1 on the Pop Airplay chart for more than 10 weeks\u2014but not much longer. Mariah Carey (\"One Sweet Day\" with Boyz II Men), Natalie Imbruglia (\u201cTorn\u201d), and Halsey (\u201cCloser\u201d with The Chainsmokers) all saw one of their smashes spend 11 frames atop the highly competitive tally./nWhen taking into account all musical acts that include women, the ranking changes slightly. Currently, the longest running No. 1 single of all time on the Pop Airplay chart is Ace of Base\u2019s 1994 smash hit \u201cThe Sign.\u201d That track held on for 14 weeks./nEarlier this year, \u201cCruel Summer\u201d helped Swift make history in another way on the same ranking. The track became her twelfth leader on the Pop Airplay chart, and when it hit the peak position, she officially broke her tie with several other stars and became the musician with the most No. 1 songs of all time. Before \u201cCruel Summer\u201d peaked, Swift was tied with Rihanna, Katy Perry and Maroon 5, who are all steady with their 11 chart-toppers./nRadio has been instrumental in the ongoing success of \u201cCruel Summer.\u201d While the track was initially a fan favorite from her 2019 album Lover, it returned to prominence after Swift began performing it on her The Eras Tour. The track quickly began streaming well, and Swift and her label released it as in a single to catch the wave. Now it looks like the tune is about to become her milestone tenth No. 1 on the Hot 100, with radio being largely responsible for the tune's continued success./n"

Nationally, a female got paid 83 cents for every $1 a man got./nSo where\u2019s the best place for female workers, looking at this compensation chasm? Women in Rhode Island earn 92% of men. That\u2019s followed by Delaware at 91% and Wisconsin at 89%. Lows? Utah and Wyoming at 75%./nOver the five years tracked, however,\u00a0California\u2019s gap narrowed by only 0.2 percentage points, ranking No. 32 and trailing the 1.3-point improvement nationally. The divide shrank in 32 states./nLeading the pack was Wisconsin, which shrank its gap by 11 points. Connecticut\u2019s gap contracted 10.4 points and Rhode Island 7.2. The lowest contractions were found in New Mexico where its gap widened by 7 points, followed by Arizona up 5.8, and Indiana up 5.1./nLet\u2019s start with job counts because the opportunity to get a paycheck is just as critical as the pay itself./nCalifornia employed the most women \u2013 5.6 million in 2021, 11% of the nation\u2019s 51 million. Next came Texas (4.5 million), Florida (3.5 million), New York (3 million), and Illinois (2 million)./nBut\u00a0California\u2019s female share of jobs was sixth-lowest at 43% vs. 45% nationally. Tops were the District of Columbia at 50%, then Mississippi at 49%, and Virginia, Delaware and Louisiana at 48%. Lows? Idaho at 41%, then Wisconsin at 42%./nOr look at women\u2019s job growth over five years. California ranked No. 29 at 3% vs. 5% nationally. Women in 41 states enjoyed gains./nTops were Utah at 23%, then Arizona at 18%, and Idaho at 17%. Lows? Hawaii saw female workers dip by 6%, then New York and Wisconsin, were off 5%./nThe pandemic business limitations varied widely across the nation in 2021. So, I also looked at the job-growth gap between women and men./nCalifornia female workers fared much better with their job growth topping men by 5.4 percentage points. That was 16th best among the states and topped the 2.9-point women\u2019s advantage nationally. Female job growth topped males in 40 states./nTops? Utah\u2019s job growth for women bested men by 18 percentage points, then came Nevada at 13, and Wyoming at 11. Lows? Wisconsin, where women fared 12 points worse, then Indiana, off 7 points, and Minnesota, off 6./nNow let\u2019s talk weekly earnings./nCalifornia ranked No. 9 at $1,020 vs. $912 nationally. Tops? D.C. at $1,565, then Massachusetts at $1,157, and Maryland at $1,134. Lows? Mississippi at $722, then Oklahoma at $738, and South Carolina and West Virginia at $756./nCalifornia women\u2019s pay rose 25% in five years, No. 8 among the states and topping 22% growth nationally./nEvery state had female pay raises, topped by D.C.\u2019s 40%, then Rhode Island at 38%, and Wisconsin at 29%. Lows? West Virginia and South Carolina at 10%, and Arizona at 12%./nAnd ponder the wage gap another way: 2016-2021 earnings improvements by gender./nCalifornia ranked No. 32 for women\u2019s raises vs. men \u2013 only 0.2 percentage points better vs. a 1.9 gap nationally. Among the states, 32 had large pay hikes for women vs. men./nTops? Wisconsin women enjoyed pay gains 16 points better than men, then Connecticut at 15 points, and Rhode Island at 11. Lows? New Mexico women trailed men by 10 points, then Arizona and Indiana with 8-point disadvantages./nWomen are clearly closing the compensation gap./nIn the entertainment world, singer Swift\u2019s tour may sell $1 billion worth of tickets \u2013 perhaps making it the music industry\u2019s largest take. \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2013 a film about women empowerment that\u2019s directed by a woman, a sad Hollywood rarity \u2013 is setting some movie industry box-office records./nAnd in everyday life,\u00a0California women seem to fare relatively well on these national yardsticks for pay and job opportunities./nTo qualify that outperformance, when these nine wage-related gradings were averaged, California ranked No. 10 among the states./nThe top five are Connecticut, Washington, Rhode Island, Virginia and Nevada.

(Photo by VALERIE MACON / AFP) (Photo by VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift's star power is not only undeniable in the world of music but also in the film world as well. The singer-songwriter's concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, has taken the global box office by storm, and even acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan is singing her praises./nNolan, a highly regarded director and a likely Oscar nominee in a few weeks, recently shared his admiration for Taylor Swift and the impact she's making in the entertainment industry. During an event promoting his film Oppenheimer, Nolan couldn't help but commend the singer for her unique approach to distributing her concert film./n\"Taylor Swift is about to show the studios,\" Nolan declared, adding, \u201cher concert film is not being distributed by the studios, it\u2019s being distributed by a theater owner, AMC, and it\u2019s going to make an enormous amount of money.\u201d He was spot-on about the financial success of her latest project, and also that studios that have typically wielded an incredible amount of power when it comes to distributing movies may now have to rethink their place in the film ecosystem./nNolan's praise for Swift extended beyond her financial prowess, which is grand enough to warrant applause from movie industry insiders. \u201cAnd this is the thing: This is a format, this is a way of seeing things and sharing stories, or sharing experiences, that\u2019s incredibly valuable,\u201d the director and screenwriter continued, and he\u2019s certainly right about the valuable part, if nothing else./nThe filmmaker's support for Swift didn't stop there. He made it clear that no matter the studio, there is a place for Swift's work in the industry. \"And if they don\u2019t want it, somebody else will. So that\u2019s just the truth of it,\" Nolan affirmed./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour made an impressive impact at the global box office from the moment it hit theaters. In its opening weekend, it became the top-grossing title in the world, earning over $123 million globally. The North American box office alone contributed nearly $93 million to that total. With these figures, Swift\u2019s new movie has already secured its place in history as the highest-grossing concert film in U.S. history./nNolan is busy promoting Oppenheimer, which became something of a surprise box office smash this summer. It competed directly with Barbie, and the pairing of the two dissimilar pictures likely helped both perform better than they might have without the marketing ploy. Oppenheimer is likely headed for a number of Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and perhaps many more./n"

    "content": "PARK CITY, UT - JANUARY 23:  Singer Taylor Swift is seen on Main Street during the Sundance Film ... [+] Festival on January 23, 2020 in Park City, Utah.  (Photo by Mat Hayward/GC Images)/nIn a little over a month, Taylor Swift will take over theaters across America with her forthcoming concert movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The title is already heading toward a massive opening weekend, with perhaps $100 million or more in ticket sales. But can the film earn the singer a coveted Academy Award nomination?/nShortly after the superstar announced Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, The Wrap highlighted the fact that the movie was not going to compete for an Oscar, at least in one specific category. The title is not eligible for Best Documentary Feature, which some fans immediately suggested it could be submitted for once news of the project broke online./n\"Works that are essentially promotional or instructional are not eligible, nor are works that are essentially unfiltered records of performances,\" states rules outlined by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the organization that awards the Oscars./nThose guidelines make it pretty clear that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour won't win the singer any trophies as a documentarian, but that's not the only field in which the movie could be eligible. If Swift writes and records a new song for the project, she could submit her movie for the Best Original Song Oscar instead./nWhile the bulk of the movie will surely feature Swift performing her biggest hits on stage, she could certainly find a space to include a new track if she wants to. There's no word yet on whether Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour will also include any footage that's not performance-based, such as her preparation for the show, backstage moments or more. There could potentially be plenty of opportunities for Swift to work in a new composition, but for the moment, she's keeping quiet as to whether or not she's done so./nAccording to AMPAS rules regarding Best Original Song submissions, \"An original song consists of words and music, both of which are original and written specifically for the motion picture.\" The tune in question must also be \"used in the body of the motion picture or as the first music cue in the end credits.\"/nSwift could conceivably write and record a new song and play it at the tail end of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour  and meet eligibility requirements. In the past, tracks ended up in the running for this prize when they only played over the credits, but that was changed several years ago. Now, the tune must actually be in the film, but only a small portion. Several recent nominated songs have essentially ended a picture by beginning while the movie is still going (but before the credits have started), so this is a tried-and-true method of securing eligibility./nSwift has been working toward an Oscar nomination for years, but so far, the honor has eluded her. She was attempting to earn a Best Live Action Short Film nod recently for her All Too Well: The Short Film music video last year, but it fell short. She has also been nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Original Song a number of times, but somehow, none of that work has translated into an Academy Award nomination./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour could change that, but there\u2019s no telling whether it\u2019s even eligible until Swift announces a new song...or it hits theaters and fans are treated to the tune without warning./n"

Entertainment that drew little notice./nHis profile has risen substantially since \u201cCatching Kelce\u201d aired in 2016. He has won two Super Bowls with Kansas City \u2014 catching a touchdown in each \u2014 and earned eight Pro Bowl selections while dabbling as a media personality, hosting a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d episode and helming a popular football podcast./nBut in terms of maximizing his celebrity, nothing compares to Kelce\u2019s brush with the aura of Taylor Swift, a 12-time Grammy winner whose Eras Tour this year has shattered concert records and even registered seismic activity./nKelce and Swift, both 33, have remained quiet about whether they are friends or a couple, or just two celebrities trying to leverage each other\u2019s fame. But fans regularly dissect Swift\u2019s dating life and failed relationships, which she has written about in her own songs./nAfter weeks of speculation about a connection between Kelce and Swift, who broke up with the actor Joe Alwyn this year, she attended Kelce\u2019s game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., on Sunday, watching from a luxury suite with his mother as the Chiefs trounced the Chicago Bears. Fox cameras panned to Swift\u2019s reaction nearly every time Kelce touched the ball. The singer\u2019s devoted swarm of fans also tuned in, with several posting on social media that they were watching football for the first time./nSwift, wearing a red-and-white outfit that matched Kansas City\u2019s colors, was then seen leaving the stadium with Kelce./nDespite Kelce\u2019s relative fame in the sports world, becoming part of the frenzied conversation around Swift\u2019s every move is another ballgame. Kelce now has 3.2 million followers on Instagram. Swift has 273 million./n\u201cThis puts him on a completely different plane from where he was as a celebrity,\u201d said Daniel Durbin, a professor of communication at the University of Southern California. \u201cThis is celebrity on steroids, and it has a powerful impact.\u201d/nAs professional athletes near retirement in their 30s and early 40s, many begin to plot their next career moves. Some become broadcasters, while others turn to Hollywood. LeBron James, the star basketball player, has started his own tequila brand and said he wants to own a team./nThat Kelce and Swift were in the same stadium this weekend brought together two fandoms that don\u2019t often overlap. A spokesman for Fanatics, the N.F.L.\u2019s official retailer, said that sales of Kelce\u2019s jersey had spiked by 400 percent as of Monday./nCoaches and players from across the N.F.L. also took notice./nBill Belichick, the Patriots coach known for gruff answers to reporters\u2019 questions, said on a radio show that \u201cTravis Kelce\u2019s had a lot of big catches in his career \u2014 this would be the biggest.\u201d The star Cowboys defender Micah Parsons posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that one woman \u201ccan change your life!!!\u201d/nCelebrity relationships in the N.F.L. are not new, but they are normally reserved for star quarterbacks who touch the ball every play. Russell Wilson married the singer Ciara in 2016; Tom Brady, who won seven Super Bowls, spent 16 years with the model Gisele B\u00fcndchen before they divorced last year./nIt is rarer, but not impossible, for a tight end to drive the national conversation. But Kelce, propelled by his stylish outfits, trimmed beard and haircut and his charismatic personality, has emerged as one of the N.F.L.\u2019s most marketable stars. Before Swift, his fame had crescendoed because of a candid podcast he hosts with his brother, Jason, the center for the Philadelphia Eagles. (Their relationship was a popular topic before last season\u2019s Super Bowl, in which the Chiefs narrowly defeated the Eagles.)/nOn their weekly podcast, \u201cNew Heights,\u201d the Kelces discuss their lives as professional athletes and speak with high-profile guests like Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell. It was also where the Kelce-Swift story line began./nIn July, Travis Kelce said on his podcast that he had wanted to give Swift a friendship bracelet during her concert tour stop in Kansas City, but that she had declined to meet him in order to save her voice. Last week, amid rumors that the celebrities were dating, Kelce confirmed in an ESPN interview only that he had invited Swift to a game./n\u201cI told her that, \u2018I\u2019ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead. You might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead, and see which one\u2019s a little more lit,\u2019\u201d Kelce said./nWhatever happens with Kelce and Swift, the attention could be benefiting them both./nHer concert movie, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d releases next month, and he is already pursuing a career outside sports. He told The Los Angeles Times this summer that he considered Peyton Manning, the Hall of Fame quarterback and founder of the content company Omaha Productions, a mentor, and he recently signed with the powerful media conglomerate Creative Artists Agency./nEmmanuel Morgan covers sports, primarily the N.F.L.

This time, at the Kansas City Chiefs vs Los Angeles Chargers game, it wasn't just her voice that caught the attention but a uniquely personalized bracelet. Taylor was there to support her budding relationship with NFL star, Travis Kelce./nDonning a vintage 1990 red Chiefs sweatshirt from Ellie Mae Vintage paired with a chic short, black pleated skirt, Taylor's ensemble was already turning heads.\u00a0/nBut it was a particular accessory that sent Swifties into a frenzy. Gone was her signature '13' friendship bracelet, and in its place was a new one bearing Kelce's jersey number '87'.\u00a0/nThis symbolic piece was elegantly flanked by heart-beaded patterns, with the remaining beads in gold, signifying a golden new chapter in Taylor's life./nEnsconced in the luxury box, Taylor was seen in the company of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany, and his brother, Jackson. Pictures of Taylor's emblematic bracelet soon surfaced on social media. It proved to be a good-luck charm \u2013 the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 31-17./nSwifties, meanwhile, didn't miss a beat. The comments section lit up with fans expressing their delight at Taylor's newfound happiness.\u00a0/nOne devoted fan shared: \u201cI\u2019m happy she found someone who doesn\u2019t shy away from her shine and treat her with love.\u201d\u00a0/nAnother cheekily referenced her ongoing tour, musing: \u201cCan't stop her when she's in her footballer's wife era.\u201d\u00a0/nA nostalgic fan even quipped, referencing one of Taylor's lyrics, '\"wear his initial on a chain round my neck, ITS OVER AND OUTDATED.\u201d/nBut this wasn't Taylor's only rendezvous with Travis. Before the much-anticipated game against the Chargers, the All Too Well singer enjoyed a cozy lunch at Travis's home, having flown into Kansas City in her private jet.\u00a0/nTheir meal of choice was a spread of turkey omelette, breakfast tacos, and rejuvenating kale tonic drinks, in the company of Travis's close-knit circle./nWith her schedule momentarily freed up before embarking on the South American stretch of her 'Eras Tour', Taylor's next performance is slated for Buenos Aires on November 4.\u00a0/nCoincidentally, this happens to align with the Chief's bye week in the NFL. This serendipity might see Travis reciprocating the support Taylor's been generously showering on him.\u00a0/nRumors are already abuzz with speculations of Travis planning to attend Taylor's concert in Buenos Aires./nThis wasn't Taylor's debut at the NFL. Her first appearance was at Arrowhead on September 24. She soon followed it up with a visit to MetLife Stadium to cheer for Kelce's match against the Jets.\u00a0/nWhile she gave the Minnesota game a miss, Taylor was back at Arrowhead to revel in the Chiefs' triumphant win over the Broncos. These games saw Taylor blending effortlessly with Travis's inner circle, celebrating in the VIP boxes, and retreating to his residence post the games."

AFP PHOTO/ROBYN BECK (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)/nSome bands continue performing live and making new music after the passing of a member, while others see it as a natural ending point. It seems that Fleetwood Mac may be done with, choosing to see the loss of Christine McVie as a likely conclusion for the Grammy-winning group./nIn a recent interview with Vulture, rock icon Stevie Nicks candidly discussed the future of Fleetwood Mac following the devastating passing of singer-songwriter and longtime band member McVie, in November 2022. Nicks wasn\u2019t coy, and it seems that she feels that the band may have reached the end of the road./nReflecting on the profound impact of McVie's death, Nicks expressed her deep sense of loss and the unique bond she shared with her late bandmate. \"When Christine died, I felt like you can\u2019t replace her. You just can\u2019t,\" Nicks revealed. \"She was like my soul mate, my musical soul mate, and my best friend that I spent more time with than any of my other best friends outside of Fleetwood Mac.\u201d/nNicks went on to emphasize the irreplaceable role that McVie played in the band's dynamic, both musically and personally. \"Without her, what is it? You know what I mean?\u201d/nThe rocker then referenced Taylor Swift in her memorial, adding, \"When I think about Taylor Swift\u2019s song \u2018You\u2019re on Your Own, Kid\u2019 and the line \u2018you always have been,\u2019 it was like, that was Christine and I.\u201d Nicks went on to add that she felt that \u201cWe were on our own in that band. We always were. We protected each other.\"/nNicks seemed to suggest that if Fleetwood Mac did perform together again, they wouldn\u2019t feel right using the songs that McVie wrote. \"Christine was the pop star. She wrote all those really super pop hits. None of the rest of us could write those songs,\u201d Nicks admitted. \u201cWhat would happen is we\u2019d have to take the songs out, like we did when she actually retired for 18 years. We couldn\u2019t re-create those songs. So we became a much more hard-rock band./nIt seems that Nicks is not alone in her feeling that Fleetwood Mac may be done with. Her comments are similar to those shared by fellow band member Mick Fleetwood earlier in 2023 when he conveyed that the loss of McVie may be it for the group. \"I think right now, I truly think the line in the sand has been drawn with the loss of Chris,\" Fleetwood stated. \"I\u2019d say we\u2019re done, but then we\u2019ve all said that before. It\u2019s sort of unthinkable right now.\"/n"

[+] Swift | The Eras Tour\" at SoFi Stadium on August 03, 2023 in Inglewood, California. (Photo by Emma McIntyre/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nIn just a few weeks, fans of Taylor Swift all around the world will get to watch her new movie Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The concert film is coming to theaters globally on October 13, and it is bound to become a box office smash. In fact, the title could very well make history with an eye-popping reaping in just a matter of days./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is on track to become the highest-grossing concert film of all time, and it won't need long to capture that record. Currently, the highest-grossing concert movie in the United States is Justin Bieber's Never Say Never. That movie earned $73 million at the box office during its theatrical run./nComing in just behind Bieber's movie is one from Michael Jackson. Following his passing, the superstar's This Is It made a little more than $72 million at the box office in North America alone./nEarly projections for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u2019s first-weekend box office draw are upwards of $100 million. So, it seems that when including all pre-ordered tickets, the singer's first theatrical project will break Bieber's record in its first few days of availability./nWhen looking globally, Swift will also likely smash everyone else's best showing. In that case, Jackson and Bieber swap spots. This Is It earned just under $182 million worldwide at theaters, while Bieber's Never Say Never came in at just under $100 million./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour could potentially become the highest-grossing concert film of all time with only its total North American numbers. If the title is expected to pull in around $100 million in its first weekend, that sum could climb considerably, depending on how long it lives in theaters. The movie is likely to run for a few weekends, if not months, and it could bring in $125 million or more domestically./nThe superstar recently announced that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is not just set to play North America, as was initially the case. Now, the film will hit theaters in more than 100 countries, playing in most of them on the same day. There's no telling how much bigger Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour could become in terms of its finances, but looking at Jackson and Bieber's performances, it's safe to assume that the project will likely earn at least 30% of its North American total around the world, adding to its overall box office pull../nOn the low end, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour could make $130 million, based on simple predictions, and that number could be after only a week or two. It wouldn't be odd to see the movie rake in $150 million, looking at early ticket sales and the past performance of similar releases from the biggest names in music./nWhatever the final total ends up being, one thing is certain: Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is about to become the highest-grossing concert film of all time, and it probably won't be close./n"

It\u2019s the largest box office opening for the director since the $41.4 million opening for \u201cShutter Island\u201d in February 2010 (starring Leonardo DiCaprio) and a special feat considering both its length \u2014 three and a half hours \u2014 and the lack of promotional support from its cast, which includes Mr. DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, because of the actors\u2019 strike./nIt earned an additional $21 million in its international release./n\u201cKillers\u201d is the largest theatrical release for Apple Studios, which will return to the box office at Thanksgiving with the Ridley Scott epic \u201cNapoleon\u201d and again in February with the spy caper \u201cArgylle.\u201d/n(Its strong showing didn\u2019t earn bragging rights for this weekend\u2019s box office. The No. 1 spot for the second week in a row went to \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d which cost $15 million. It earned an estimated $31 million for a total of $129.8 million \u2014 a boon for AMC Theatres Distribution\u2019s first release.)/nAccording to the worldwide distributor Paramount Pictures, the film about the murders of members of the Osage Nation, a Native American tribe in Oklahoma, in the 1920s, performed well in the top movie markets of Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco but also drew audiences in Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Mr. Scorsese filmed the movie in Oklahoma and cast a number of Osage in the film./nMore men saw the film than women, and 44 percent of the audience was under 30, a surprise for Paramount./n\u201cThat was really telling and bodes well for the future of cinema,\u201d Paramount\u2019s president of domestic distribution, Chris Aronson, said in an interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that many younger people would seek this movie out because, on the surface, you wouldn\u2019t think that there would be that much appeal there.\u201d/nThe issues surrounding the brutal treatment of the Osage Nation, he added, seemed to resonate. \u201cEven though it occurred 100 years ago, it\u2019s a story that needs to be told and deserves to be seen,\u201d he said./n\u201cKillers\u201d also scored an A- in exit polls, according to the market research firm CinemaScore, the same score given to Mr. Scorsese\u2019s \u201cGoodfellas\u201d and \u201cThe Departed.\u201d/nWith a budget of around $200 million, even if it grosses five times its opening weekend numbers \u2014 which a lot of films by Mr. Scorsese do \u2014 it\u2019s unlikely to earn back its cost at the box office. Perhaps that\u2019s not an issue for the wildly acclaimed \u201cKillers.\u201d The movie, which was produced and financed by Apple in conjunction with Imperative Entertainment, has generated strong reviews, with The New York Times calling it a \u201cheartbreaking masterpiece.\u201d It\u2019s likely to be part of the awards conversation this year./nPlus, Apple\u2019s plan to put it directly on its service after its theatrical run should be a welcome bonus to Apple TV, which, despite producing quality work, has had difficulty attracting a significant following on its streaming service./nDavid A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office information, declared \u201cKillers\u201d an important movie to the industry for two reasons. One, because Mr. Scorsese is considered a \u201cmaster storyteller\u201d and \u201cfilmmakers and audiences believe this is \u2018real cinema.\u2019\u201d And two, because Apple is venturing into new territory./n\u201cIf \u2018flexibility\u2019 is the new mantra of the theatrical movie business,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthen this is a significant success \u2014 it establishes a viable option for the companies.\u201d/nNicole Sperling is a media and entertainment reporter, covering Hollywood and the burgeoning streaming business.

They\u2019re a mix of the bold-faced names of celebrity gossip and billionaire masters of the tech and financial universes, with some surprising exceptions./nDespite the jet owners\u2019 enrollments in PIA, it\u2019s still possible to see how frequently Taylor Swift has visited her tall American boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in Kansas City; where Magic Johnson is chasing the next deal in his Gulfstream III; how many times Kenneth Griffin has visited France, or where Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin and Evan Spiegel \u2014 or at least their planes \u2014 have taken off and landed./nThe public can also follow jets owned by Walmart and employee-owned WinCo Foods as they zig-zag the country, and we\u2019re privy to the otherwise hush-hush athlete-recruiting efforts of the University of Kansas, which has been taking flak for years from faculty over the expense of its Cessna Citation CJ4./nPlane watchers follow the aircraft by tracking transponder signals that planes have been required to transmit since 2020. The transponders flash out location, altitude, speed and a unique ID code assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)./nThe system is called Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or ADS-B. When it was first sketched out in the 1990s, its designers didn\u2019t anticipate that plane-spotting enthusiasts would use inexpensive receivers to capture the signals and collaborate online to create coverage maps that track planes around the world./nHence the FAA\u2019s privacy program, which allows jets to send out fake codes to thwart identification by everyone except the authorities. It costs nothing to enroll in PIA \u2014 short for Privacy ICAO Aircraft Address \u2014 but it\u2019s complicated and time-consuming for plane owners to change their codes and test whether they\u2019re functional./nExperts told Forbes that the program isn\u2019t working because not enough aircraft are using it \u2014 the FAA said it\u2019s issued about 390 alternate ID codes since PIA began in 2019 \u2014 and jet owners don\u2019t change their fake codes frequently enough./n\u201cIt\u2019s useless,\u201d says Martin Strohmeier, cofounder of the European crowd-sourced flight-tracking website OpenSky Network. \u201cAt worst you could even say it\u2019s dangerous because people may believe it gives them some sort of cover, which it does not.\u201d/nNot that Taylor, if we can call her that, can hope for any cover. Millions of Swifties follow the pop icon\u2019s every move. Still, flight tracking may provide special insight into her heart. Her plane has visited Kansas City three times so far in October. Just about everyone knows Swift was in the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium on October 12 to watch a football game featuring the guy whose career she made. JetSpy \u2014 and Sweeney\u2019s Instagram account @taylorswiftjets \u2014 inform us that her jet dropped her off that day, returned home to Nashville, then came back to Kansas City on October 14. Heart-hands emoji./nOthers fly to destinations for reasons unknown to outsiders. Griffin, for example. Forbes estimates his net worth at $33.5 billion; one of his firms, Citadel Securities, acts as the intermediary for more than one in three U.S. retail stock trades. His plane, a Bombardier Global Express (price tag: $12 million used), has notched 195 flights this year through Monday, traveling 257,000 nautical miles. According to JetSpy, the billionaire\u2019s plane has visited France more often this year than Chicago, where Citadel was headquartered until last year (it moved to Florida) and where it still has a big presence./nThough we have no special insight into Griffin\u2019s heart \u2014 he didn\u2019t respond to requests to talk about his air travel \u2014 we can surmise that he, like Musk, has security reasons for wanting his jet to fly under the radar. For instance, Griffin\u2019s whereabouts are tracked on Reddit by retail stock investors who blame him for the controversial 2021 halt in GameStop trading on the Robinhood platform, which helped big trading houses dig out from under billions of dollars in losses while hurting many of the trade-at-home folks. Griffin denied involvement./n\u201cI\u2019ve seen my clients deal with threats to their safety because of people that were tracking them,\u201d Dan Drohan, CEO of Solairus Aviation, a company that manages over 300 private jets for their owners but has no connection to Griffin, told Forbes. \u201cIt\u2019s most upsetting for the ones that have kids.\u201d/nSweeney, who Musk allowed to set up a new account on X (nee Twitter) tracking Musk\u2019s jet as long as he waits 24 hours to announce its location, defends cracking the PIA codes and publicizing what he finds. \u201cThis account has every right to post jet whereabouts,\u201d he tweeted in 2022 before he was banished. The transmissions of planes\u2019 locations are public information, he said, and \u201cevery aircraft in the world is required to have a transponder, even AF1,\u201d a reference to Air Force One, the U.S. president\u2019s plane./nAnother reason for the jet set\u2019s touchiness: environmental advocates have used plane-tracking to measure the harm that private jets cause to the world\u2019s climate and to shame their owners. For instance, the average American produces 16 tons of carbon dioxide a year. By comparison, Griffin\u2019s jet, in the first nine-plus months of 2023, has emitted about 12 million tons./nTracking also allows for corporate espionage of the legal variety. Brad Pierce, who owns Restaurant Equipment World, told Forbes that the sales calls he makes in his Cirrus SR-22 have enabled him to expand his Florida-based business. He said it\u2019s also allowed a large competitor that he won\u2019t name to monitor his travels and then drop in on the potential customers he\u2019s been pitching. He said that the sources for that information are the company\u2019s executives themselves, who\u2019ve confessed to him at industry conventions. \u201cThey said, \u2018We have one guy in our office who is just nonstop trying to track where you are so we can send our own people in afterward,\u2019\u201d Pierce told Forbes./nGaining an edge in business is a selling point for subscription jet-tracking sites like JetSpy, Quandl and JetTrack./nFor PIA to work, aircraft owners should ideally change their fake identity codes for every flight, according to Strohmeier of OpenSky Network./nRight now that\u2019s impossible, said Rene Cervantes, operations vice president for aircraft manager Solairus Aviation, which has a handful of clients who use PIA. Changing the code requires the transponder manufacturer to produce a software update on a compact disc, of all things, which can take a month. Many owners interested in the program don\u2019t follow through after hearing what\u2019s involved, Cervantes told Forbes./nSome PIA enrollees appear to have given up. Among those who haven\u2019t flown under an alternate address since last year are Kim Kardashian, Mark Zuckerberg and the private-equity giant Blackstone Group, led by billionaire Stephen Schwarzman./nFrench billionaire Bernard Arnault has given up, too. But he\u2019s taken it one step further. Last year, after the CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH came under fire from a Twitter account looking to shame him over his carbon-dioxide emissions, he sold the company jet./nArnault, whose $187.6 billion fortune Forbes said this month makes him the second-wealthiest person in the world, is now a renter, not an owner./n/n"

Both the LAPD and the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department placed extra patrols on trains after a man was killed Wednesday night on the to the K (Crenshaw) Line, one station away from the Hawthorne/Lennox Station that ran one of two shuttle buses that dropped off fans at the stadium./nMetro rail lines A, B, D, E, C and K will operate late, until 2 a.m. to accommodate Swifties after the concerts, which run Aug. 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9. Since no train actually stops at SoFi, two free shuttles took passengers directly to the concert venue from a train station. One ran from the K (Crenshaw) Line\u2019s Downtown Inglewood Station. The other ran from the C Line\u2019s Hawthorne/Lennox Station. The shuttles will run 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. before each show, and for 90 minutes after the concerts./nBut the two shuttles were not full Thursday and the line to get on board the K Line at the Downtown Inglewood Station was nearly empty around 5 p.m., as extra accommodations went unneeded./nRows of security tape forming snaking lines before the shuttles became merely decorative as buses came and went with space inside to spare. A pop-up stand at one station selling TAP cards \u2014 in anticipation that there may be long lines at its three vending machines \u2014 struggled to get any traffic./nThose who did take public transit often rode early and were prepared in advance./nViridiana Gonzalez and Victoria Kravitz knew they wanted the peace of mind of riding Metro.\u00a0The pair, who have been friends and Swift fans since high school, left from Arcadia on the A Line, wanting to avoid the frustrations that might come from riding with their parents./nKravitz said the more than two-hour public transit commute wasn\u2019t a concern, and well worth it to escape the anxiety of traffic, parking, or other logistics./n\u201cWe get to get there early and enjoy the atmosphere and experience,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s better than stressing with my parents for two hours.\u201d/nMany concert-goers were being dropped off in the ride-hailing lot at SoFi.

She arrived shortly before 11 a.m./n\u201cI may carpool after the concert with some of the people I met,\u201d she said./nGail Gallaher of Pasadena took the A Line train from the Memorial Park Station at around 2:30 p.m after waiting more than 20 minutes./nShe planned on meeting her husband at the stadium, after he parks their car at a school that rented out parking spaces. The couple had reserved a space there ahead of time./nWhile the train connections were a bit like alphabet soup, she is a veteran Metro user and felt confident she could find her way. \u201cI am taking the A Line,\u201d she said, pausing for several seconds, \u201cto the God I don\u2019t even know I think the Expo Line, then to the K Line, then to the shuttle that will get us to SoFi.\u201d/nFor many Swifties, the concert is just part of the night out. And that\u2019s what they say makes her concerts different. Some call it a spiritual experience./n\u201cI think it will be fun,\u201d Gallaher said before she boarded her first train. \u201cOnce I get closer to the concert I am going to see other people there and that will be fun.\u201d/nMaria Gonzalez, 31, took a bus from Tijuana to Union Station on Thursday, the first leg on her journey to her first-ever Taylor Swift concert./nShe was on her phone hailing an Uber, leaning against the Metro information booth at the downtown train hub in the early afternoon./n\u201cI am very excited. I don\u2019t believe this moment is happening because it is here already,\u201d she said. She bought the tickets as part of the original sale by Ticketmaster, not through a re-sale, she said. They cost about $150 each./nHer husband, Juan Morales, 34, whom his wife said was not a big Swift fan, said he was curious to learn first-hand what has become an American phenomenon./n\u201cI want to try to understand the culture, all the fashion,\u201d said Morales. \u201cI want to see the outfits of the other girls and the people of all ages who are coming to this concert. I\u2019m also looking forward to all the lights and sounds.\u201d/nThe two carted a small suitcase on wheels out to the curb near Alameda Street. It contained Gonzalez\u2019s outfit: a sparkly, green top that mimics what Swift sometimes wears, she said./nWhen asked if the cost of the tickets, the nearly 4-hour bus ride from Mexico and the Uber to the stadium is worth it, she responded without hesitation:/n\u201cIt is worth every cent,\u201d she said. The two then quickly got into a silver Toyota Uber as the driver carefully stowed her rolling case in the trunk, then sped off./nIn my seat! Section 531!

    "content": "Travis Kelce has been catching a lot more than footballs lately, and fans everywhere have been swift to hop on the Taylor Swift bandwagon. The celebrity couple has been in the news for well over a week now, and despite the fatigue from many --\u00a0Chris 'Mad Dog' Russo's rant being among the most vocal -- companies like FanDuel just can't help but lean into a profitable storyline. Are they for real or is this \"Love Story\" just some extravagant publicity stunt?/nTime will tell, but one thing's for certain when it comes to the media, social media, newspapers, football fans, Swifties, and just about everyone else within the 50 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam: \"You need to calm down.\" Regardless, Kelce and Swift take their tour on the road to Broadway, a place that puts on all the great shows. The traditional circus hasn't been in town for a few years now, but that's simply because the New York Jets exist and there was only room for one. It seems like ages since Aaron Rodgers marched out of the MetLife Stadium tunnel holding an American flag, but this is Zach Wilson's team now, whether you like it or not.\u00a0/nOne of the most hyped \"Sunday Night Football\" games of the year was expected to feature Rodgers against Patrick Mahomes for the first time. Instead, we're more likely to be treated to non-stop split screens involving Swift and Rodgers, two people who won't be on the field. There will be some actual football, though, even if it is just a sideshow to the event everyone can't stop talking about. So, buckle up and enjoy whatever this is, and for all the fans paying ridiculous prices for a glimpse of Ms. Swift \u2014 make sure your phone is charged.\u00a0/nTo Travis and Taylor, \"Welcome to New York.\" It's been waiting for you. Well, actually, the swamps of northern New Jersey have. Enjoy the traffic and a look at the famous skyline./nFor bettors, where there is hype, there's also an opportunity to make some money. FanDuel has released a special prop bets menu, cleverly called \"Prop Stars\" for the Swift-inspired wagers. Here's a look at how you can catch some cash in prime time.\u00a0/nMORE:\u00a0Jets vs. Chiefs betting preview/nThe Jets know that Kelce is trouble long before he even walks in. If they want any chance in this game, they'll have to slow down No. 87. This is a New York defense that's been very good, although not quite great, over the last year and continues to improve. Robert Saleh's troops have held opponents in check, giving their anemic offense a fighting chance most weeks, but if there's one thing that Gang Green struggles to defend against, it's the tight end. They're giving up the fifth-most receiving yards to the position this season (56.3) and just allowed Pharoah Brown to beat them for a long 58-yard touchdown last Sunday. Getting +140 is a nice price for the best pass-catcher in this game, but there's too much blowout potential to warrant taking a flier here.\u00a0\u00a0/nOur pick:\u00a0Pass/nIf this bet ends up cashing, the \"Seeing Red\" tagline would apply to a lot more than just Chiefs fans. Bettors would be in the green, and those wearing green would be the ones with red-ish, cartoon-like faces. Odds are, Wilson would have to be atrocious again considering New York's defense isn't a pushover. The Jets often like to make games close, even when they seemingly have no business in doing so. Even if they are steamrolled, a garbage time score is more than enough to ruin this wager.\u00a0/nOur pick:\u00a0Pass/nOut of all the specials, this one is our favorite. The Chiefs will likely score first whether they get the opening kickoff or not. When we look at the Jets, we see an offensive coordinator that somehow underrated Micah Parsons and a team that refuses to take the training wheels off their former gunslinging quarterback. Wilson has turned into \"Checkdown Charlie\" as a result of conservative coaching, and we don't expect that to change in the early going. Lean into the narrative and sprinkle a little cash on Kelce to break the plane first./nOur pick:\u00a0Bet on it/nObviously, based on our last recommendation, we're friendzoning this bet and not laying down any action on it.\u00a0/nOur pick:\u00a0Pass/nThe strength of the Jets roster is along the defensive line, and the Chiefs are a pass-first team that loves to light it up through the air. This is the first time that Patrick Mahomes is playing in the New York area. He'll want to put on a show, and Andy Reid certainly isn't going to hold him back. Don't expect the Chiefs to start running until it's time to chew the clock.\u00a0/nOur pick:\u00a0Pass/nRanch is a fine condiment and beloved by many, which makes this wager something that should be seen as an insult to ranch fans everywhere. Unless the Jets make this a close game or send it to overtime, we have a hard time believing that Kelce will even be on the field to score the last touchdown. Avoid this one like people with taste buds avoid bleu cheese and treat your nuggets with respect.\u00a0/nOur pick:\u00a0Pass/nIf you asked the average Jets' fan what is holding this roster back, the overwhelming results would be Wilson. \"I'm the problem, it's me,\" would probably qualify as the lyrics played in his walk-up song if fans had anything to say about it. But Wilson doesn't have time to be the anti-hero, or villain, as traditionalists would say. He needs to flip the script and shake it off. The Jets need to let him sling the ball around the field instead of worrying about the bad turnovers. They aren't winning this game 14-10, and they aren't winning anything if they can't let their quarterback be who he is. Are we betting this? Absolutely not, but that would be one heck of a plot twist, right? Perhaps the script writers are working overtime.\u00a0/nOur pick:\u00a0Pass/nWhen it comes to Kelce's greatest hits, he prefers to save them for division rivals like the Raiders and Chargers. In your wildest dreams this bet might hit, and it might happen in reality too. Kelce could be schmoozing in the suite when the second half begins rather than throwing blocks and catching footballs on the field. But if the Jets keep it close, they are prone to being exploited by players like Kelce. With receivers lacking on the Chiefs sideline, the tight end might put on a show that is typically only found in show business. Considering he hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d back in March, Kelce is familiar with how to tell a story. We have him scoring once, so what\u2019s another two times to cash a monster long shot? Don't count on it, but don't rule it out either. And please, have fun and bet responsibly.\u00a0/nOur pick:\u00a0Bet on it (with a small wager)/nThe Jets are currently back in a familiar place as the laughingstock of the NFL. Swift, like many celebrities, has plenty of exes, but she always scores again. Maybe the haters are right. Maybe Kelce will be the subject of the next big hit. Maybe the publicists are cashing checks with this brilliant idea. Maybe it's real. Time will tell, but when the relationship inevitably falls apart like most dream celebrity couples do, there is always another someone. Point is, the Jets are without the quarterback they married, and now they're back together with Wilson. It's not glamorous, but they'll score again. Shutting out NFL teams is no easy task, but the Chiefs defense is much improved and the Jets look like a team that doesn\u2019t have a quarterback. Don\u2019t consider it likely to hit, but +3400 wagers hardly ever are. Consider this a fun bet, unless you\u2019re a Jets fan, and see how long K.C. can keep NYC off the scoreboard. They might just do it for the entire game./nOur pick:\u00a0Bet on it (with a small wager)/nNick Brinkerhoff is an editorial intern at The Sporting News."

Paulo./n Music /nA 23-year old student died at the Swift concert as the heat index reached a reported 140 degrees. Fans were not permitted to bring water into the stadium./nNov. 18, 2023/nThe concert\u2019s organizer, Time For Fun, corroborated Fernandes\u2019 account in an Instagram post and added that Benevides died after receiving emergency medical attention for an hour. No official cause of death has been reported./nAccording to Folha, the heat index at the Est\u00e0dio Nilton Santos reached 140 degrees, causing 1,000 fans to faint, per an unofficial firefighter count. Videos from the concert showed Swift stopping the show twice to get more water bottles into the crowd, and she herself threw bottles from the stage to distressed fans./nOver 60,000 people attended the concert, and the venue had prohibited fans from bringing water bottles inside. Temperatures in Rio had been soaring all week \u2014 on Tuesday, the heat index hit 137 degrees, the highest ever recorded in Rio./nTime For Fun also announced that Saturday\u2019s show will be rescheduled for Nov. 20 and that Sunday\u2019s show will go on as originally planned. Swift is also scheduled to perform three shows in S\u00e3o Paulo from Nov. 24-26./n Music /nTaylor Swift fans lit up Brazil\u2019s Christ the Redeemer statue Thursday.

I can\u2019t even tell you how devastated I am by this,\u201d she shared in a handwritten note. \u201cThere\u2019s very little information I have other than the fact that she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young. I\u2019m not going to be able to speak about this from stage because I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it. I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends. This is the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil.\u201d/nIn response to Benevides\u2019 death, fans started a petition, which had surpassed 200,000 signatures by Saturday morning, to create a law that would provide free water at all venues in Brazil. Fl\u00e1vio Dino, Brazil\u2019s minister of Justice, tweeted Saturday morning that personal water bottles will now be allowed into concert venues, and promoters hosting shows with \u201chigh heat exposure\u201d will be required to provide accessible water stations inside the venue./nTimes staff writer Kenan Draughorne contributed to this report. /nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

Ms Lynch, 31, is a nurse who is visiting New York ahead of a trip to Paris this weekend, but as a true fan of Ms. Swift, she just so happened to be prepared. She showed up to the movie theater by herself in a \u201cLover\u201d-era influenced shimmering pink dress completed by a bag of friendship bracelets inspired by Ms. Swift\u2019s lyrics./nAs more fans showed up \u2014 most with the official gray Eras Tour T-shirt \u2014 Seana Slattery and Riley Keohane, friends from Marymount Manhattan College, opted for a more elegant yet somber look with dresses that are reflective of the music found on the albums \u201cFolklore\u201d and \u201cReputation.\u201d/n\u201cI\u2019m giving a \u2018Mirrorball\u2019 moment, which is a \u2018Folklore\u2019 song \u2014 Track 6 \u2014 it\u2019s my favorite song on that album,\u201d Ms. Keohane said, who didn\u2019t have the chance to see this tour live (blame last year\u2019s presale Ticketmaster fiasco), but came to the screening./nSome die-hard fans showed up only to have a chance to be one of the first to collect official Taylor Swift memorabilia at the concession stands./nLiam Speranza and Derek Mong didn\u2019t come to sit through the movie (they had just finished a SoulCycle class), but wanted to get their Taylor Swift merchandise before it sold out./n\u201cThis stuff is for sure going to be gone by this weekend so we had to get it,\u201d Mr. Speranza said as he juggled a popcorn bucket and cup. He had already bought tickets for a Sunday showing of the film when the first wave were initially released last month./nThough the megaplex in Times Square is used to being a hub of activity, the last-minute announcement of earlier showtimes \u2014 and the fact that many had already bought tickets for the weekend \u2014 made the turnout seem more like a private viewing party. And Swifties took advantage of it./nMarco Zefi, an engineer from Queens, and Liz Burg, a user-interface designer who lives in Lower Manhattan, made sure to grab their picture in the lobby before entering the auditorium.

[+] GRAMMY Awards at Staples Center on February 15, 2016 in Los Angeles, California.  (Photo by Kevin Winter/WireImage)/nIn just a matter of weeks, Taylor Swift is poised to unleash her highly-anticipated re-release of the album 1989, now titled 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). The revamped version of 1989 will feature slight reworkings of the original tracks from an album that not only achieved massive sales as a collection but also spawned seven hit singles./nAmong its popular singles, which include chart-toppers like \"Blank Space,\" \"Bad Blood,\" and \"Shake It Off,\" there exists an intriguing oddity: one of the official singles from the project has never been certified by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America)./nThe RIAA is responsible for bestowing prestigious certifications such as gold, platinum, or diamond plaques upon tracks and albums that meet specific sales thresholds. Gold is awarded for 500,000 equivalent units sold, platinum for one million, and diamond for 10 million./nAlmost every song featured on 1989 has earned some form of certification, which is a common occurrence for some the most successful albums of recent years. However, what\u2019s shocking is that one of the official singles from the album has yet to receive any recognition from the RIAA./n\"Out of the Woods\" was chosen as the sixth official single from 1989. Released in January 2016, well over a year and a half after Swift started promoting the album, it arrived as one of the final offerings from the project. Surprisingly, despite the album being out in the world for more than a year by the time the tune was promoted, the track still performed well./nSwift propelled \"Out of the Woods\" into the top 20 on the Hot 100, and it peaked at No. 18. The single also enjoyed success on the radio, landing within the top 20 on all three of Billboard's pop-focused radio charts. Still, despite industry acclaim and evident public interest, the single has yet to achieve even a gold certification./nTo put this anomaly into perspective, several non-single tracks from 1989 that never received the official single treatment have garnered at least one RIAA award. \"This Love\" achieved platinum certification, while album cuts like \"All You Had to Do Was Stay\" and \"How You Get the Girl\" have been certified gold./nIt is probable that \"Out of the Woods\" has accumulated significant sales and streams deserving of recognition, and it may be a matter of Swift's label or the RIAA taking the time to process the necessary paperwork and confirm the consumption numbers for award presentation. While it remains uncertain when and at what level the certification will be bestowed, it is likely that Swift's single will ultimately join its fellow 1989 tracks in receiving the recognition it deserves\u2014perhaps soon./n"

Taylor Swift performs onstage for the opening night of \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at State Farm Stadium on March 17, 2023 in Swift City, ERAzona (Glendale, Arizona). The city of Glendale, Arizona was ceremonially renamed to Swift City for March 17-18 in honor of The Eras Tour. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nWhile Taylor Swift is currently engrossed in the promotion of her single \"Cruel Summer\" from her 2019 album Lover, she might already have her sights set on her next move. \"Cruel Summer\" gained unexpected popularity earlier this year and has now found its way into the top 10 of the Hot 100 chart, with a chance to rise even further in the coming weeks. Amidst her focus on the catchy pop track, she might be secretly contemplating her next musical move./nWhether Swift intends to release more singles from her latest album of original material, Midnights, remains unknown. Considering the series of events that have unfolded since the album's late 2022 release, she might be ready to move on, or she might be trying to choose what comes next. One track in particular seems to be the frontrunner for single status, and it's a very good choice./nHints have been circulating that \"Bejeweled\" is in the running to be chosen as the fourth official single from Midnights, although Swift hasn't officially confirmed this speculation. If this turns out to be true, it would indeed be a strategic choice./nTo begin with...\"Bejeweled\" is already a hit in its own right. During the week of the Midnight\u2019s release, Swift dominated the entire top 10 of the Hot 100, with 10 tracks from the album taking up space in the competitive region. \"Bejeweled\" reached as high as No. 6 on the chart, so it doesn\u2019t have much higher to go if it is promoted./nThe song even received its own music video, but that doesn't mean it's been given the full might of a Swift single. It has thus far been held back to promotional single status, and there's more that could be done with the tune./nAs Swift continues her The Eras Tour, she has been captivating massive crowds with performances of the songs from Midnights. The U.S. leg has concluded, and the tour is currently making its mark in Central America. With \"Bejeweled\" making its appearance on the tour's setlist each evening, Swift has the opportunity to remind tens of thousands of fans every night of the song's appeal. This attention could translate into increased streaming numbers and purchases if Swift officially announces \"Bejeweled\" as her next single./nSpeculations around \"Bejeweled\" being promoted as a single gained momentum just before Swift embarked on her six-night \"residency\" at Los Angeles's SoFi Stadium. The venue's official Twitter account shared altered images that hinted at several special things in her future./nNotably, one teaser alluded to Swift's announcement of her upcoming re-recorded album, 1989 (Taylor's Version). With this prediction turning out to be very true, the image in the same tweet referring to \"Bejeweled\" cannot be overlooked./nAs Swift balances her tour efforts and pursues the No. 1 spot for \"Cruel Summer\" on the Hot 100, she is simultaneously working on another project. 1989 (Taylor's Version) is anticipated to drop in late October, and how she\u2019ll approach promoting the set remains a mystery. It could potentially become her most successful re-release yet, generating a multitude of hit singles./nIn this context, the potential selection of \"Bejeweled\" as a single from Midnights could either complement or influence these upcoming plans. If Swift does decide to shift her focus back to Midnights, \"Bejeweled\" might prove to be an excellent choice for a successful single release, but at this point, there\u2019s no telling what she plans on doing./nNote: This article has been updated to include language clarifying that \"Bejeweled\" has already been released as a promotional single, but not a full-fledged single./n"

[+] Club Band', at a press conference held at the west London home of their manager Brian Epstein. The LP is released on June 1st.  (Photo by John Pratt/Keystone/Getty Images)/nThe Beatles are back with their first new single in decades, and their fans are showing up to support the just-released tune. The legendary rock band is proving their power as \"Now and Then\" arrives on Spotify's rankings of the most-streamed songs all around the planet, and the group has even managed to best the biggest star in the world... at least in one place./n\"Now and Then\" was the No. 1 most-streamed song in the U.K. on Spotify on Thursday, November 2. The track racked up just under 387,000 streams in less than a full day. It pushes Taylor Swift's new track \"Is It Over Now?\" down from the top spot. On the same day, that track earned another 383,000 streams./nThe Beatles' last single is not just performing well in the U.K., though that is where the track is doing the best, which is understandable as they remain perhaps the most successful musical act to emerge from that nation. The cut debuts at No. 71 on the same chart in the U.S. That's much lower than the No. 1 starting point it managed in the U.K., but it's still the top launch from Thursday, November 2. In America, \"Now and Then\" earned a little more than 450,000 streams upon its arrival./nGlobally, \"Now and Then\" has also earned a warm reception. On Spotify's ranking of the most-streamed tracks in the world, The Beatles' new single starts its journey at No. 42. The tune launches with a little more than two million streams./nAll these streams, paired with what appear to be very healthy sales on platforms like iTunes, will likely make \"Now and Then\" a chart hit in a few days. The tune could bring The Beatles back to songs charts in many countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., where the tune might perform the best./n\"Now and Then\" was released nearly 30 years after The Beatles' previous most recent single. It started as a demo by John Lennon, created after the band broke up. He died before he could finish the song, and his voice was too muffled on the original recording to use...until new artificial intelligence technology allowed it to be cleaned up. Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr reunited to finish the song, releasing it to the public on November 2./n"

A few months ago, Ratajkowski expressed disdain on social media for the way Swift was treated by Ellen Degeneres in a clip that has recently resurfaced online. The clip in question depicts the former talk show host grilling Swift about her dating history./nIn the clip, Degeneres has Swift participate in a game where photos of Swift with different famous men flash on a screen. Swift is told to ring a bell each time a photo depicting Swift and an ex appears, and Swift is visibly uncomfortable throughout the segment. \u201cStop it, stop it, stop! This makes me feel so bad about myself,\u201d Swift shouts while seemingly holding back tears in the video. /n\u201cThis is so fucked up,\u201d\u00a0Ratajkowski wrote on social media in regards to the clip. \u201cShe\u2019s literally begging her to stop.\u201d/nSwift has been making a huge buzz in the media as of late with her record-breaking Eras Tour. It was recently reported that Swift gave her tour team $55 million bonuses. Truck drivers who worked the Eras tour were given a $100,000 bonus by Swift. /nWhen the Eras Tour stopped in Seattle on July 22 and July 23, Swift fans cheered so hard, they created a sensation similar to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake. Seismologist Jackie Caplan-Auerbach discussed the occurrence with\u00a0CNN, saying the shaking caused by Swift fans was more severe than that of the 2011 NFL game known as \u201cBeast Quake.\u201d/n\u201cThe primary difference is the duration of shaking. Cheering after a touchdown lasts for a couple seconds, but eventually it dies down. It\u2019s much more random than a concert,\u201d Caplan-Auerbach said. \u201cFor Taylor Swift, I collected about 10 hours of data where rhythm controlled the behavior. The music, the speakers, the beat. All that energy can drive into the ground and shake it.\u201d/nPhoto by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic/nSee more/nOnly members can comment. Become a member.

    "content": "Welcome to the Wide Shot, a newsletter about the business of entertainment. Sign up here to get it in your inbox./nNote to Hollywood: When you create a cultural event that appeals to multiple generations of women, you might get a billion-dollar blockbuster. /nGreta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d has grossed more than $1.18 billion at the global box office, turning movie theater auditoriums into seas of pink. Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour,  which last week concluded a run of six sold-out shows at Inglewood\u2019s SoFi stadium,  is projected to earn a staggering $1.3 billion. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d tour is headed for a gross of more than $500 million in ticket sales, according to Billboard. /nEach event is a phenomenon in its own right, owing to the quality of its creator\u2019s work and vision. /nBut collectively, they also represent the pent-up demand among consumers whose buying power has always been a powerful economic driver but has clearly been waiting for something big to explode. It\u2019s not often that the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia touts the effect of a pop music tour on the local economy, the way it did for Eras. /nWall Street Journal reporters Sarah Krouse and Anne Steele partly ascribed the boom to what they called the \u201cwomen\u2019s multiplier effect.\u201d That\u2019s what happens when female consumers show up in groups for a film or concert, buying not just tickets but also clothing, dolls, drinks and hotel rooms for an all-out experience. It\u2019s what gave \u201cBarbie\u201d screenings their party-like atmosphere, complete with themed cocktails and costumes./n\u201cWomen have always been a deeply underestimated economic force,\u201d UTA\u2019s Blair Kohan told the Journal. /nThe boost from group-buying is reflected in the ticketing numbers. /nThirty-eight percent of moviegoers for \u201cBarbie\u201d  have gone in  groups of three or more, according to data firm Movio, compared to 25% for the typical film. Nearly one in  10 (9%)  have gone in  groups of five or more, compared to 5% for other movies. There\u2019s also a significant amount of repeat business, with 7% of moviegoers  seeing it again. About 60% of the \u201cBarbie\u201d audience is female, Movio said. /nAnd there\u2019s a more specific demographic that has flexed its muscle at the movies and at packed stadium concerts: moms. /nA crucial factor in the success of \u201cBarbie\u201d  is that it appeals to mothers (represented in the film by America Ferrera\u2019s character, Gloria) who grew up with the Mattel dolls and can now share that experience with the next generation, said Larry Vincent, a USC Marshall School of Business marketing professor who has worked with brands including Mattel. /n\u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re seeing here is a rite of passage,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cIt\u2019s making them feel good about that time in their lives.\u201d/nA similar cross-generational theme is playing out amid the Eras tour, with moms and dads taking their children to what, for many, is their first concert. Whole families are going together. Attendees are returning for multiple nights, which, given the ticket prices (which were going for upward of $1,000 on the resale market), reflects the tour\u2019s astounding draw. /nSwift made Eras the ultimate FOMO (fear of missing out)-inducing event, with a 3\u00bd-hour set list and a multisensory experience that  lighted up TikTok for days on end. Not only is this Swift\u2019s first tour since 2018 but it\u2019s also the first one to come after the COVID-19 pandemic. She made it count for her fans, using it as a platform to announce the re-recording of her album \u201c1989.\u201d /n\u201cWith both these two summer phenomenons, we have this really strong ritual dimension of consumer behavior at play here,\u201d Vincent said. /n\u201cPart of the virality of \u2018Barbie\u2019 is that it\u2019s tapped into this cultural thread that has multiple generations involved. And I think there\u2019s a similar piece with Taylor Swift. Just look at the amount of commerce that\u2019s happening with people booking hotels and buying the friendship bracelets. Those are pretty powerful forces in consumer behavior.\u201d /nAs Swift turns young people into concertgoers, \u201cBarbie\u201d is bringing people back to the movies in the post-pandemic era. /nAbout  1 in 5 ticket buyers for \u201cBarbie\u201d in the U.S. \u2014 22% \u2014 hadn\u2019t seen a film in theaters  in the last six months, according to Movio. \u201cInfrequent\u201d moviegoers, or those who trek to the multiplex two times or fewer every six months, represented nearly half (46%) of attendees. /n\u201cWe\u2019re pulling people off the couch, and that\u2019s what you see when you get box office grosses like that,\u201d said Matthew Liebmann, chief innovation and data officer for Movio\u2019s parent company, Vista Group, who also hosts the \u201cBehind the Screens\u201d podcast. \u201cYou have to get the people who don\u2019t come that often.\u201d /nThe movie industry ought to have absorbed the message by now, although the number of studios run by women remains a minority. To be sure, billion-dollar blockbusters are outliers, pretty much by definition. But it would be a mistake to witness a summer like this and shake it off as a fluke. /nAfter more than 100 days of striking, the Writers Guild of America resumed negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the major studios, on Friday afternoon. /nThe parties have agreed to meet again with the union\u2019s full negotiating team, and the WGA is expected to respond to the studios\u2019 counterproposal. The best sign that the negotiations are for real this time? The lack of bomb-throwing rhetoric immediately following last week\u2019s meeting. /nMore strike coverage: /n\u2014 Video game voice actors say \u2018soul of the industry is on trial\u2019 with unregulated AI. As the actors\u2019 strike continues, voice actors hope for their own contract requiring consent and compensation for AI to reproduce their voice or likeness./n\u2014 The King\u2019s last hurrah: Elvis Presley\u2019s \u2018Aloha From Hawaii via Satellite\u2019 turns 50. The famous 1973 concert, beamed around the world to a global audience, gets a lavish reissue in the wake of the smash success of Baz Luhrmann\u2019s \u2018Elvis.\u2019/n\u2014 Creative Artists Agency to lay off 60 people as strikes drag on. CAA\u2019s cuts come as the industry continues to reel from dual Hollywood strikes that have shut down many productions./n\u2014 \u2018I\u2019m not going to make $1\u2019: The director of \u2018Sound of Freedom\u2019 breaks his silence. After weeks distancing himself from the controversy around his summer box-office sensation, Alejandro Monteverde finally tells \u2018the whole story.\u2019/n\u2014 ICYMI: Laura Jarrett named co-anchor of NBC\u2019s \u2018Saturday Today.\u2019 Hallmark Media chief Wonya Lucas, praised for expanding diversity, steps down. Emmy Awards telecast pushed to Jan. 15. \u2018Barbie\u2019 banned in Lebanon and Kuwait. CNN overhauls its program lineup. TV stations head Wendy McMahon takes over CBS News./nBob Iger priced Disney+ too low when the service launched in November 2019 at $6.99 a month. /nIn October, the cost of watching Walt Disney Co.\u2019s marquee streamer ad-free will increase to $13.99, up $3 from the current monthly fee ($10.99) and double the original price tag. /nThe reasons for this are clear. Disney+ arrived at a time when Wall Street rewarded subscriber growth, and Disney delivered big time. Now, user acquisition has plateaued and profitability is the name of the game. So Disney has to charge more and spend less on content. /nUltimately, that means Disney+ subscribers are going to pay more for less stuff. /nThis is happening all over the industry. Disney\u2019s ad-free Hulu is leaping to $17.99 a month. Netflix and NFL+ have jacked up their rates./nThe change will probably drive more people to watch Disney+ with commercials, at a cost of $7.99. That\u2019s fine, because advertising brings in plenty of cash. Iger also hinted, pretty clearly, on last week\u2019s earnings call that Disney+ will soon follow Netflix\u2019s lead by cracking down on password sharing. /nWill viewers rebel the same way they do when the prices rise at Disneyland?

At the 11th hour, Swift postponed her Saturday show until Monday, to the dismay of thousands of fans who had already started filling the stadium. The military police said a fan who was in Rio de Janeiro for the regularly scheduled concert on Sunday was stabbed to death earlier that morning./nThe fatalities and other problems were a departure from the triumphant first leg of Swift\u2019s Eras Tour, a career-spanning production that broke records in North America. As the tour\u2019s second show in Rio de Janeiro approached on Sunday night, fans grappled with ruined travel plans, extreme heat and disappointment./nAnne Di Motta, 30, a psychologist in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, was supposed to attend the Saturday night show and said she would be returning home before the rescheduled concert on Monday because she had to work./n\u201cI spent the last 17 years waiting for the opportunity to go, to fulfill my teenage dream of meeting someone I\u2019ve known since her first single,\u201d Di Motta said. \u201cAnd to be sitting three hours in a chair, completely wet with sweat, having to overcome several personal challenges to be there completely alone, to receive the news that it was canceled \u2014 it was completely devastating.\u201d/nThe Saturday night show was postponed because of the extreme temperatures, Swift said in an Instagram post hours before the concert was supposed to begin at an open-air soccer stadium. \u201cThe safety and well-being of my fans, fellow performers and crew has to and always will come first,\u201d she said./nAt that point, thousands of fans had traveled to see Swift, enduring the peak of the day\u2019s heat, which reached 93 degrees Fahrenheit, or 34 degrees Celsius, before they were asked to leave the venue. Reuters reported that the heat index, a measure of how hot it feels when humidity and other factors are considered along with the temperature, reached 59.7 degrees Celsius, or 139.5 degrees Fahrenheit, in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday, a record./nA representative for Swift did not immediately respond to emailed questions about the postponement of the Saturday show./nThe Rio shows came after Swift performed in Argentina, the first stop on the Eras Tour outside North America. She had to move one show in Buenos Aires because of a storm. She is scheduled to perform in S\u00e3o Paulo on Nov. 24, Nov. 25 and Nov. 26, before traveling next year to cities across South America, Asia, Australia and Europe./nJulia Alvarenga, a social media influencer, was in the stadium when the concert was postponed and said in a video shared widely online that she had arrived for the show at 11 a.m. \u201cTaylor Swift, I\u2019m wearing a geriatric diaper that doesn\u2019t even close on me,\u201d Alvarenga said./n\u201cI bought water, I bought a fan, everyone is crying, screaming, so you show up on this stage!\u201d Alvarenga said./nGabriela Werner, 24, a marketing analyst, bought tickets for each show in Rio and two in S\u00e3o Paulo, and said she started preparing for the heat three months ago by working out in a gym without air conditioning in the middle of the day. She lives in Porto Alegre, about 700 miles southwest of Rio./nWhile waiting in line for Sunday night\u2019s concert, Werner said the atmosphere was much calmer than that of the Friday show. \u201cIt\u2019s not so hot, and everyone\u2019s kind of holding back because of the nights before and everything that happened,\u201d she said./nShe did not expect Swift to return to Brazil. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s traumatized,\u201d Werner said./nWerner, like many other fans, blamed the Brazilian company that organized the show, Time for Fun, for the problems. Wadih Damous, the head of Brazil\u2019s consumer protection agency, said the government would investigate Time for Fun. The company said on Saturday that it would add staff, provide free water and allow fans to enter the stadium with water and food./nAs crowds left the stadium on Saturday night, there were reports of unrest near the site, the police said./nAfter Matheus Duarte, 24, a warehouse worker, left the stadium and went to a shopping mall nearby, he saw people yelling that there was a raid./n\u201cI don\u2019t really know if it really happened, but I saw desperate people running,\u201d Duarte said. \u201cAnd as soon as I saw it, I started running along and hid in a car park.\u201d/nOn Sunday, the military police said there had been no reports of robberies or muggings the night before. But before the concert on Sunday, a fan in Rio de Janeiro for the concert was stabbed to death after an attempted robbery in Copacabana, the famous beachside strip, the military police said. Two men had been arrested, they said. The fan, Gabriel Mongenot Santana Milhomem Santos, was with friends when he was stabbed, the civil police said./nDuring Friday\u2019s show, Ana Clara Benevides, 23, died after losing consciousness, officials said. She was pronounced dead of cardiac arrest after being taken to a hospital, according to city officials and the Brazilian company that organized Swift\u2019s show, Time for Fun./nBenevides, a psychology student, had traveled from Rondon\u00f3polis, which is about 880 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, for the concert, O Globo reported. Her friend Emiliane F\u00e9lix, 22, told O Globo that Benevides had been sending her friends photos of her outfits for the concert \u201cfor over a month.\u201d/nOn X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Benevides shared her excitement about the concert, writing on Nov. 7, \u201cI don\u2019t know what my purpose in life will be after I see Taylor.\u201d/nFans at the concert on Friday complained about a lack of water and extreme heat. The heat index, reached 139 degrees Fahrenheit, a record for Rio./nIn an online post, Swift said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d by her fan\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to speak about this from stage because I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it,\u201d she said./nLuiza Guimar\u00e3es, 33, an economist, said that she was disappointed it took so long for Saturday\u2019s show to be canceled because some fans were already unsure if it would go on after Benevides\u2019s death and were worried about the heat. \u201cReally, the production of the show was very reckless and everything was very poorly managed,\u201d she said./nGuimar\u00e3es said that she doesn\u2019t blame Swift for the problems and that she thought the musician must be \u201cvery, very discouraged.\u201d/nReporting was contributed by Genevieve Glatsky in Rio de Janeiro and Jack Nicas in Buenos Aires./nAn earlier version of this article misstated the reason Taylor Swift had to reschedule a concert in Buenos Aires. It was because of a storm, not heat./nAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of a Taylor Swift song.

Now, before the title has even reached theaters, it has already surpassed an incredible milestone./nWith about a week to go until its cinematic release, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour has already exceeded $100 million in advance ticket sales globally.

AMC is distributing Swift\u2019s film./nWith $100 million already earned in presale tickets, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour stands as one of the most successful concert films of all time...and it hasn\u2019t even opened yet. Only a handful of concert-focused movies have passed that milestone, and it\u2019s likely that Swift\u2019s is the first to do soil with presales alone./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour shows a slightly truncated version of Swift\u2019s current trek, The Eras Tour.

She just concluded her concerts in Mexico, and will soon head to South America. The trek picks back up in 2024, and she\u2019ll take her shows to Europe and Asia, before returning to the U.S. for a few more ending dates later in the year./nBy the time Swift is done with The Eras Tour, it will become the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Current projections estimate that it will become the first such venture to pass $1 billion in ticket sales, and by the time it\u2019s done with, that final figure will be much higher./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is set to hit theaters on October 13. The movie is set to premiere in 100 countries, with almost all of their receiving the film at the same time, though a few nations will have to wait a few weeks./nSwift\u2019s movie has been breaking and resetting records and expectations since tickets first became available. It notably established a single-day ticket sales record for AMC Theatres in North America, raking in an impressive $26 million. Swift\u2019s achievement surpassed the previous all-time benchmark for the company, which had been held by Spider-Man: No Way Home. That animated movie once brought in $16.9 million in ticket presales in a single day./n"

[+] Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour at Nissan Stadium on May 06, 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by John Shearer/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nWeek after week, Taylor Swift continues to achieve feats on the Billboard charts that are nothing short of remarkable. Her accomplishments often rival the most significant milestones in any other artist's career. The current week is no exception, as her performance on a specific Billboard ranking underscores not only her influence and popularity but also her ability to manage multiple successful projects simultaneously./nPresently, Swift occupies eight spots on Billboard's Canadian Hot 100, the weekly compilation of the most-consumed songs in Canada. While this is an impressive achievement, it's not her number of charting tracks that's particularly striking. Instead, it's the range of albums these songs hail from that truly stands out./nAmong the eight tracks Swift currently has charting on the Canadian Hot 100, they originate from five distinct albums. Few artists can manage the feat of sending multiple tracks from more than one of their own albums to a competitive ranking of hits at one time. Achieving such a showing with five albums at once is virtually unheard of, and Swift might be one of the few\u2014if not the first\u2014to accomplish such a remarkable feat./nAt the forefront of Swift's current successes on the Canadian Hot 100 is \"Cruel Summer.\" This latest hit from the singer reaches a new peak of No. 2, and it is potentially poised to claim the chart's top spot, if it can surpass Morgan Wallen's formidable single \"Last Night.\" \"Cruel Summer,\" featured on her 2019 pop album Lover, was recently released as an official single after enjoying newfound popularity among fans./nReturning to the top 10 is \"Karma,\" the most recent single from her latest entirely original release, Midnights. The song rises once again to No. 10, having previously reached No. 4. Not far behind, another track from Midnights, \"Anti-Hero,\" remains popular at No. 20./nIn an unexpected move, the next two charting singles from Swift are both from her 2014 blockbuster album 1989. \"Style\" and \"Blank Space\" make modest ascents, reaching Nos. 34 and 36, respectively. These tracks, which remain among her top-performing songs ever, have experienced renewed interest following Swift's announcement of the re-recorded version of 1989 is set for release this fall./nJust a couple of positions below \"Blank Space,\" there's \"August.\" Though not formally released as a single, the track has garnered substantial fan appreciation. Originally part of her surprise album Folklore, released amid the global pandemic in 2020, it has resurfaced on several Billboard charts, appropriately coinciding with the change from July to August./nSwift's final two placements on the Canadian Hot 100 stem from her most recent project, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version). This re-recorded and re-released edition of her early work proved to be a massive global success upon its release a month ago. This week, \"I Can See You (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)\" rises to No. 63, after previously reaching as high as No. 8. Occupying the No. 76 spot is \"Enchanted (Taylor\u2019s Version),\" a favorite re-recording among Canadian fans./n"

(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for MTV)/nJust a day or so ago, Taylor Swift finally announced 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), the latest in her series of re-recorded early albums. The set, which will see her rework and add new tunes to her pop blockbuster 1989, is coming in late October. The immense excitement around the announcement may be so huge that it could have a very meaningful impact on the first edition of the catchy set./nCurrently, 1989 stands as Swift\u2019s second-biggest album in America in terms of units shifted. The title has been certified nine-times platinum by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America). That means the blockbuster has moved nine million equivalent units. It has managed that huge sum thanks in part to huge sales but also due to the success of its many singles./nThe RIAA takes streams of songs featured on an album into consideration, and they factor heavily into its current methodology when it comes to certifying titles. So the more fans stream the songs on 1989, the more equivalent album units it moves. Singles like \u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cBlank Space,\u201d and \u201cBad Blood\u201d all rank as among Swift\u2019s biggest and most-certified, so as listeners continue to press play on them (and many others from the project) regularly and throughout the nearly nine years since 1989 debuted, they are helping to add more equivalent album units to its total./n/nNow that 1989 and the updated 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) are in the news and trending across social media, attention to that music has been renewed. Millions around the country are bound to turn to streaming sites and continue streaming 1989 in huge numbers, perhaps in even greater ones than recently./nAs fans continue to stream (and even buy) 1989 and its many hit songs, they add to its growing total, and they may soon listen enough to give the album another platinum plaque. At the rate that 1989 and its singles are being played, the set could go diamond before 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) drops in October./nIf, or more like when, 1989 does earn a diamond certification, it will mark Swift\u2019s second album to collect that prize. Her sophomore set Fearless is already her biggest yet, sitting pretty at 10 million equivalent units shifted. Soon, 1989 may join it, making Swift one of a very small number of acts to collect more than one of these highly coveted awards./n"

    "content": "LA Metro\u2019s enhanced response during the six August days of Taylor Swift concerts at SoFi Stadium is being examined as a test for a much bigger event \u2014 the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games./nDuring the pop singer\u2019s concerts from Aug. 3 through Aug 9, a rollout of shuttles, more frequent city buses and late-night rail lines running until 2 a.m. resulted in a 25% overall increase in ridership, Metro reported. The K (Crenshaw) Line increased by 250%, the C (Green) Line by 35% and stadium shuttle passengers carried 30,000 people to and from the Inglewood stadium./nWhile Metro touted its success at a recent committee meeting, two things became clear if Metro is going to succeed in making the L.A. Olympics carless during 16 days from July 14 to July 30, 2028. First, providing extra transit is costly. Second, any response requires a nimble operation able to meet fluid demands through coordination./nIt cost Metro around $660,000 to help Swifties get around without driving for six days in August, the agency reported. And Metro operations had to shift on a dime when the pop singer extended concerts scheduled to end at 11 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. That meant trains and shuttles had to run even later, for example./n\u201cThe only certainty is uncertainty,\u201d said John Gordon, director of social media and marketing at Metro, during an assessment of the effort at a Metro committee last week. \u201cThere were a lot of needs for us to react to in real time. These are live events and conditions change.\u201d/nFor concert-goers, Metro renamed stations for six nights. The Hawthorne/Lennox C Line Station had new signs that read \u201cTaylor Nation Station.\u201d/nBut Gordon said Metro needed more wayfinding signs, especially directing fans after the concert to the Metro shuttle going back to the train stations. Some social media comments were about getting lost or not finding the correct shuttle bus after the show./n\u201cOther things we can do is help people establish where they got off, and so when they come out of the concert they are able to remember. We should take a cue from Disney and say, \u2018I parked in the Goofy lot,\u2019 \u201d he said./nGordon said because there were multiple shuttle operators, it caused confusion for people seeking the Metro shuttles back to the train stations./n\u201cMany were not regular riders of our network. We needed signage to help people,\u201d said Joseph Forgiarini, Metro senior executive officer for service development./nShuttle drivers and Metro city bus operators needed to know the best routes to take and to avoid end-of-concert traffic from 60,000 concert-goers each night. Coordination with SoFi\u2019s bus drop-off and pick up facility was critical, Metro reported./nMetro also cited communication with Swift\u2019s concert operations team to predict attendance and the concert\u2019s start and finish times. Assessing the \u201ctransit demand\u201d is something that must be known during the Olympics as well, Metro staff said. \u201cWe could gain a lot of information from venue management,\u201d Forgiarini said./nMetro received criticism for not running shuttles, late-night trains and extra city buses during the three nights when Beyonc\u00e9 played the arena, Sept. 1. 2. and 4. Metro staff said they were told that SoFi did not operate its inter-modal bus shuttle facility on those nights, so Metro could not add its own shuttles and extra service./nInglewood Mayor and Metro board and committee member James Butts said Metro just needed to ask his office to open the SoFi bus facility. \u201cIf you ever want our inter-modal (facility) open, all you have to do is call us,\u201d he told Metro staff during the meeting./nThe Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies will take place at SoFi Stadium, so keeping all transportation systems operating, and keeping communications open with Metro, will be key during the Olympics./nAnother issue was getting riders to use the TAP app or Apple Pay to load fares before they arrive at a station or venue. Waiting for someone to load their TAP cards or phones with cash to pay the $1.75 fare for a train or bus causes long backups./nMetro CEO Stephanie Wiggins emphasized that traffic control in and around the venues was key. Some called for a dedicated bus lane into downtown Inglewood./nInglewood is rushing to build a 1.6-mile automated transit system, also known as a people mover, from the K (Crenshaw) Line to the stadium, to help with access from Metro train lines. The Inglewood Transportation Connector will run from K Line\u2019s Downtown Inglewood Station to SoFi Stadium, the Kia Forum, Hollywood Park and the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 future Intuit Dome. The people mover is slated to break ground in 2024 and be completed in 2028./nMetro board and committee member Ara Najarian remembers the 1984 L.A. Olympics. He said that after the games many stayed to trade pins or buy merchandise or food. That kind of lingering creates a different challenge for transit agencies, he said. \u201cPeople would come and stay a long time after the event. You might not have that intense crush you had with Taylor Swift,\u201d he said./nStuart Waldman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association, serves on the L.A. 2028 Olympic Games Committee. He\u2019s attended many Olympics and World Cup soccer events in cities throughout the world. At the Rio Olympics, he remembers a venue area with several big TV screens showing medal ceremonies and highlights from other contests./n\u201cYou want to keep people happy. And you want to communicate with people,\u201d Waldman said on Monday, Oct. 2./nHe agreed that Metro needs to keep practicing transportation controls at large events as run-ups to the Olympics. Getting people to ride transit will reduce congestion./n\u201cIn many cases, there is just not parking to handle that amount of people,\u201d Waldman said. \u201cIf you tell a neighborhood you are going to have a lot of people and cars, those neighborhoods don\u2019t want that.\u201d/nThe LA28 Olympic website recently posted renderings of a temporary sports park in the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area that would host equestrian, shooting, and canoe events during the games. The complete list of events hosted in L.A. has not been issued./n\u00a0"

A re-recording is when a music artist or group records a new version of a song that was previously released./nVeteran music attorney Josh Karp, who has seen the new restrictions in the UMG contracts, told Billboard that he tried to get rid of it entirely. \u201cI was just like, \u2018What is this? This is strange. Why would we agree to further restrictions than we\u2019ve agreed to in the past with the same label?'\u201d/nThis change represents a departure from the long-standing norm in music contracts. Artists are typically required to wait for five to seven years from the initial release or two years after the contract expires to re-record their music./nIt\u2019s worth noting that re-recording restrictions have been in place for decades; however, they have only recently come into the spotlight because of Taylor Swift (which we\u2019ll expand on below). The limitations are meant to stipulate that an artist cannot re-record a song while they are still under contract with a particular label or within a specific period after their contract ends. This is to maintain exclusivity with the original recording./nGLENDALE, ARIZONA - MARCH 17: Editorial use only and no commercial use at any time.  No use on ...

(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nRecord labels also make substantial investments in the artists they sign, and their music catalogs are considered valuable assets. As a result, they employ various strategies to safeguard these investments and minimize risks, such as time restrictions, exclusivity clauses and more./nHistorically, artists would re-record only a handful of their most significant hits \u2014 or maybe their biggest albums decades later. But in the case of Taylor Swift, re-recording her catalog is about ownership and not so much about nostalgia \u2014 although she manages to achieve both./nSwift\u2019s masters (her first six albums) were purchased in 2019 by Scooter Braun \u2014 a move that Swift says occurred behind her back. They were eventually sold to Shamrock Capital for $300 million in 2020. In response, the 33-year-old decided to re-record her first six albums and add \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d at the end of each title so fans could distinguish between the re-recordings and the originals. She also signed a historic deal with Universal Music Group that would give her complete ownership over songwriting and the recordings, ultimately boosting her earnings in the long run./nThe pop star\u2019s efforts greatly paid off. Forbes named Swift a billionaire in October 2023. A whopping $500 million of Swift\u2019s fortune derived from music royalties and touring, while another $500 million came from the rising value of her music catalog. This makes Swift one of the only musicians to earn her billion-dollar fortune through music alone./nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 20: (EDITORIAL USE ONLY) Taylor Swift, winner of Favorite Pop ...

During her more than two decades as a journalist, she has written at least 50 celebrity profiles./nSection 301, in the second-to-highest tier of Levi\u2019s Stadium, floats 105 feet above Santa Clara, Calif. It comprises 251 seats \u2014 a mere hamlet in the vast 64,000-seat general kingdom of the place, but it was our hamlet, and on the last Saturday in July, we took up each one of those seats and watched, our collective breath held, as Taylor Swift emerged from a bevy of billowing pastel parachutes and rose up on a platform to perform the 47th show of her Eras Tour. A few songs in, she announced, laughing, that her father told her that Santa Clara had named her its honorary mayor during her two-night stay there and that the entire town had been renamed Swiftie Clara. On the way in, we saw the Police Department cheerfully exchanging friendship bracelets with legions of Swifties. The microcosm of Section 301 offered this same sense of sorority. What a nice neighborhood we had moved into, my 15-year-old son, Ezra, and I. Within minutes of sitting down, we were already a community with a shared, ardent sense of purpose. /nOpen this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS./nThe mood was solemn \u2014 spiritual, even. I have prayed at dawn at the Temple Mount. I have stood among quivering supplicants at the graves of biblical forefathers. I have walked in trembling silence as I entered farther and farther into the inner sanctums of the Vatican. This was like that, except for girls. /nThe young women to Ezra\u2019s left wore moody black \u201cReputation\u201d-era dress and could not have been more than 16. They were speechless and breathless and did not move or sit down once the entire night because they were afraid they might miss something. Three rows back sat a line of tweens in pink sundresses, white cowgirl hats and sparkling cowgirl boots \u2014 Taylor Swift\u2019s debut era for her self-titled album. To my right were two men wearing matching T-shirts that said: \u201cIT\u2019S ME, HI. I\u2019M THE HUSBAND. IT\u2019S ME.\u201d Their wives, who were friends, chose (smartly) to sit together on one side. During songs they didn\u2019t know, which were most of them, they talked to one another, using words like \u201creps\u201d and \u201cC.E.O.\u201d and \u201cacquisition.\u201d /nBut listen: Over my right shoulder, just above the HUSBANDs and their wives, stood a young man with a glitter heart around his eye, like the one Taylor wears on the pastel cover of the \u201cLover\u201d album, accompanied by a young woman, I guess his girlfriend, who wore a sparkly purple dress, like the one Taylor wears on the cover of \u201cSpeak Now.\u201d If our kingdom was also our high school and our hamlet our homeroom, they were our prom king and queen. On the stage below, Taylor made her way from her \u201cLover\u201d era to her \u201cFearless\u201d one, and suddenly she was singing \u201cLove Story,\u201d one of her many early songs in which a girl loves a boy but he doesn\u2019t love her back, or he doesn\u2019t know to love her back because of some other girl who has unjustly commandeered his love. Or, in the case of \u201cLove Story,\u201d she\u2019s Juliet, and there\u2019s so much drama with Romeo\u2019s family, and we all know what\u2019s going to happen if they can\u2019t be together./nBut then we get to the bridge, and the story changes. In \u201cLove Story,\u201d just as Juliet is despairing and hopeless, Romeo drops to his knees and tells her he has talked to her father and asks her to marry him. And here, in 301, on our very own balcony, something crazy happens. Over my and Ezra\u2019s right shoulders, just behind the HUSBANDs, THE PROM KING ASKS THE PROM QUEEN TO MARRY HIM! AND THE PROM QUEEN SAYS YES!!!/nDoes Section 301 go wild! We take pictures and congratulate them. We ask to see the ring. We shake our heads with our mouths open because this night is sparkling and young love is amazing./n\u201cDid you see that?\u201d one of the HUSBANDs asked. I told him I did./n\u201cWhat are you writing down?\u201d he asked. I told him that I\u2019m a writer for this magazine and that I was writing about Taylor Swift./n\u201cHuh,\u201d he said. \u201cI would think that they\u2019d give The New York Times better seats.\u201d/n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d I answered. The truth is, I bought these seats on my own./n\u201cAre you talking to her?\u201d he asked. I told him no. I told him I had made my requests but was turned down. My boss, too. Her publicist had politely told us that she was too busy to do an interview. And that\u2019s probably true. Or maybe she has an exclusive somewhere else. /nOr \u2014 and this was what I\u2019d been thinking lately \u2014 maybe we were in entirely new territory. She hasn\u2019t done a traditional magazine profile since 2019. She announced this tour on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and her very own social-media accounts. She released two pandemic albums, \u201cfolklore\u201d and \u201cevermore,\u201d by dropping them into the world with a day\u2019s notice. For \u201cfolklore,\u201d she released a full-length film in which she expounds on each song; it was called \u201cFolklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions,\u201d and it was directed and produced by Ms. Taylor Alison Swift and needed no intermediary to explain it to her audience./nShe has become one of a new breed of postmedia celebrities who have set new rules of engagement with both the media and the fans. Technology has risen to meet these new rules, and perhaps there really is nothing I can offer her, that we the media can offer her, that would help her sell more albums or become better known or more successful or more beloved than she already is. Witness this historic cultural event: this no-signs-of-stopping, local-economy-upending tour. Eras is its own news cycle, its own tabloid, its own Tumblr, its own news release and, as we would find out in a few weeks, its own movie set./nAnd we in Section 301 were enthralled by her, even though we couldn\u2019t actually see her from where we were sitting. All we could really see was a tiny figure in an angelic dress, running across the stage down below. Our only proof that she was actually in the stadium was that the people close to the stage seemed to believe that she was, and we chose to believe them. But it didn\u2019t even matter that we couldn\u2019t see her. Our devotion is maximal; her engagement is total. We were in a trance. /n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d said the HUSBAND, who turned back to the other HUSBAND to discuss, I think, baseball./nNow, below, the mayor of Swiftie Clara was sitting at a moss-covered piano for a song called \u201cChampagne Problems.\u201d It\u2019s a song about a woman who turns down a man\u2019s proposal. Some of us in Section 301 shared a knowing laugh-nod because we knew that our prom queen\u2019s rejecting the king\u2019s proposal had been a possible outcome of what we just saw, and we were all very happy that we didn\u2019t have to sit in that particular awkwardness. I looked up over my shoulder at the prom queen again. Her attention was burrowed toward the stage, as she mouthed the words to all the songs in deep concentration. /nThe HUSBAND was talking to me again. He was saying he\u2019d heard that Taylor Swift stood to make a billion dollars by the time this tour was through, and was asking if I had, too, but I needed him to repeat the question. I was still thinking about our prom queen, in her purple dress, about the way your life could change in the middle of a song you\u2019d been listening to for years. I was thinking about the notion of dividing a life into befores and afters \u2014 into eras; I was thinking about the way that it feels as if you\u2019re always leaving things behind. /nEzra and I had arrived hours before showtime, to a stadium that was already almost completely full. The sun was still bright when we went to take our spots on the merch line, which \u2014 how can I describe it? Have you ever seen old pictures of Ellis Island? I told Ezra to stay close./nWe thought we were beating the system by ascending to the third level, but the joke was on us. We saw two merch stands, advertising $70 hoodies and $35 T-shirts. We had been warned that the sheer numbers would create the kind of chaos that exhausts a concertgoer before the opening act. I\u2019d read savage stories about fans\u2019 fainting in line or wearing adult diapers. /nBut our line was peaceful; what nobody talked about when they posted crowd photos on social media was how gentle the experience was, an atmospheric sage-burning in time for the season of this football stadium\u2019s normal, violent uses. Around us, stranger approached stranger and held out a wrist full of beaded bracelets that named various Taylor Swift albums, which were here doing business as \u201ceras,\u201d to choose from; stranger took another era off her own wrist and traded it back, a wordless ritual that everyone understood. Stranger was no longer stranger but friend. /nThey were dressed as circus ringleaders and fully rendered mirrorballs. They were swamp creatures and zombies. They wore bustled strapless petticoated gowns; they donned black velvet hooded capes. They were girls in the bleachers; they were enchanted to meet you./nThe organizing principle of the Eras Tour is that it is a celebration of Taylor Swift\u2019s own eras \u2014 how, at 33, she has already cycled through so many periods of identity on her public journey from girl to woman. Her life story is one that you could read about in the reams of magazine profiles that have been written about her over the years, one that even the least Swift-engaged young women across at least two generations have learned by sheer internet use and osmosis: She grew up on a Christmas-tree farm in Wyomissing, Pa., where she would listen to Shania Twain and Faith Hill and LeAnn Rimes and watch VH1\u2019s \u201cBehind the Music\u201d and record demo tapes to send to Nashville. At 12, she sang the national anthem at a 76ers game. Soon after, she called her friends to see if they wanted to go shopping with her, but they all said they were busy. So her mother took her to the mall instead, and there were her friends, hanging out together. Her mother turned her around and took her to a different mall, but you can imagine that Taylor Swift died a little that day, and what she was reborn as was someone for whom there was not enough love and approval in the whole world. She would write a song about the experience, and she would feel better. She would realize that this new person she had become was someone whose best work would come from her reactions to the world, her urgent metabolization of her pain into poetry./nThe Swifts moved to Nashville to help support Taylor\u2019s career, and one night, at a talent showcase at the Bluebird Cafe, she caught the eye of a Universal executive named Scott Borchetta. In 2005, Borchetta started his own label, Big Machine, and signed her immediately. It soon became clear that her music could serve the audience segment that country music had long neglected \u2014 teenage girls./n\u201cWhich era are you?\u201d one of three young women behind us in line asked. Have I mentioned the glitter? It was everywhere, and these three were covered in it. /nThey were 18 or 19, and the one who asked me was wearing a gold, fringey dress, which connotes the \u201cFearless\u201d era. \u201cYou Belong With Me,\u201d off Swift\u2019s second album, won a Video Music Award for best female video. During her speech, Kanye West stormed the stage and announced that it was actually Beyonc\u00e9 who had made the best video of the year, leaving Taylor standing there, frozen, stunned and confused for too long a period. You could see in the ensuing years, as she talked about it in the press, that she was slowly coming to understand what really happened on that stage, which was that she had been murdered again, right there in front of everyone she knew and respected./n\u201cOh,\u201d I said to the young woman who posed the question, looking down at my outfit. I was wearing a bootleg gray T-shirt with a design of Taylor\u2019s face wearing sunglasses. The sunglasses reflected back the numbers 1989. \u201cI guess I\u2019m \u20181989\u2019? That was the first album I liked, but \u2018Reputation\u2019 is my favorite.\u201d/nHer friends were in different eras, too. One was wearing a variation on a fluffy purple dress that a lot of them were wearing \u2014 the \u201cSpeak Now\u201d era \u2014 and the other was wearing a black fedora and black sequin hot pants and a T-shirt that said: \u201cWHO\u2019S TAYLOR SWIFT ANYWAY? EW,\u201d from the \u201cRed\u201d era. Part of the Swiftian ethos is learning how to take something that seems like a diss and turn it into a last laugh./n\u201cThe era isn\u2019t the album you like,\u201d the \u201cRed\u201d one said. \u201cIt\u2019s the one you are.\u201d/n\u201cLike, it\u2019s where you\u2019re at these days, you know?\u201d the \u201cSpeak Now\u201d one said./nI nodded. Made sense. Ezra had to go to the bathroom, but so many of the men\u2019s rooms had been turned into women\u2019s rooms for the event that we hadn\u2019t seen one from the line so far. I sent him off./nTaylor released \u201cSpeak Now\u201d the year after the Kanye incident. They had become something like friends; they even had dinner sometimes. By then, she seemed to feel bad for him. The world had judged him harshly for his behavior. The literal president, Barack Obama, had called him a jackass. Taylor wrote a song that is almost certainly about Kanye, called \u201cInnocent.\u201d \u201cWho you are is not what you did,\u201d it goes. On a visit to her Nashville apartment, a journalist noticed a framed photo of the moment Kanye interrupted her on the V.M.A. stage, a twisted reminder of either the fact that you can triumph over your own repeated murder or the fact that at any moment of triumph someone will be there to kneecap you. /nEzra returned from the bathroom. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cThe men\u2019s room was emp-ty.\u201d We\u2019d been in the line for what seemed like hours by then. He\u2019d grown a little bit of beard while he was gone. \u201cIt was really nice, actually. Peaceful.\u201d/nBy the time \u201cRed\u201d came out in 2012, Taylor was still holding on to who she wanted to be: a hardworking, songwriting-obsessed, fan-obsessed country-singing juggernaut. But if this story were one of Taylor\u2019s beloved \u201cBehind the Music\u201d episodes, an ominous voice would come in and say that here was where things started to fray. People were starting to say that she dated too much. They said she cared too much. They accused her of being insincere. Some of the songs on her new album, \u201c1989,\u201d were about old relationships, but a lot of them featured this cartoon version of herself that she was hearing about \u2014 the version that stays out too late and goes on too many dates (\u201cShake It Off\u201d), or the one that has a long list of ex-lovers who will tell you she\u2019s insane (\u201cBlank Space\u201d). She stopped dating, and in the place of male romantic partners she formed a supergroup of famous female friends \u2014 everyone from Lena Dunham to the model Karlie Kloss to Lorde to Selena Gomez \u2014 and on the tour for \u201c1989,\u201d she marched those friends of hers out onto the stage for everyone to see. Take that, mallrat bitches of Wyomissing!/nHer music had changed by then. Suddenly, her slow creep from country sped into pure pop, leaving country behind, wishing it well and taking only its tradition of sinuous storytelling with her. Her voice changed, too. Gone was the yodelly vocal flip of the country singer. By then, we had endured a long moment of female artists whose voices seemed outsize for the body of a regular human: melismatic, with 10 notes to a syllable of a word, or a gravelly voice, where a woman sounds as if she is digging down, grinding something out. Consider Taylor\u2019s approach: a voice so pure and pretty that it makes you wonder why so many of her musical peers and predecessors work so hard. It\u2019s not an otherworldly voice, but a specifically worldly one. She sings how you would sing if you were talking and became so overcome with emotion that your voice was lifted and carried by it. It\u2019s how I would sing if I could. /nNow Ezra wanted to check out the concession stand. I gave him some money and sent him off, noting a subtle balding that had begun around his temples. Two women wearing stuffed snakes around their necks came up, and one handed me her phone and asked if I could take their picture./nThe snake is Taylor\u2019s biggest and best version of the diss-to-last-laugh boomerang, the \u201cWHO\u2019S TAYLOR SWIFT ANYWAY? EW\u201d writ impossibly large and deadly. After the \u201c1989\u201d tour, in 2015, after the showboating of the friends onstage, after moving to New York and starting a new life, things got weird. In 2016, her friend Kanye resurfaced with a lyric in a new song called \u201cFamous\u201d that went: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that bitch famous.\u201d He made an accompanying video that featured what looked like Taylor Swift naked in bed with him (along with several other naked celebrities), though it was only a likeness of her. Taylor was appalled by it, but Kanye said he had her permission. His wife at the time, Kim Kardashian, released an edited video clip that appeared to support Kanye\u2019s claim. Taylor continued to deny it, and later, when the full video surfaced, it was clear that Taylor was telling the truth. /nNow it was war. Kim Kardashian posted snake emojis, and everyone knew she was talking about you-know-who. A crowd at a Kanye show chanted, \u201c[Expletive] Taylor Swift!\u201d /nThis came after a minor Twitter beef with Nicki Minaj and amid a falling-out with Calvin Harris. It seemed as though the entire world had turned on her. Now, they said, it was clear that she had always been a fraud. Now, they said, it was clear that even her feminism wasn\u2019t real; it consisted of lining up her pretty, mostly white friends onstage to take pictures or wear matching bathing suits on the Fourth of July. And what kind of feminism was that video for \u201cBad Blood,\u201d which features a bajillion famous women, when the song itself is said to be about a grudge Taylor had against Katy Perry?/nTaylor is a digital native. She watched this all play out and knew she couldn\u2019t fight the tidal wave that had come for her. She nuked her social media and disappeared. Her website was nothing but a black page. When she re-emerged on social media, it was with a grainy video of \u2014 was that \u2026 ? It was a snake./n\u201cReputation,\u201d released a few months later, is an album full not of apology but of confession (real or performed). It is filled with ferocious songs of self-loathing, of admitted (ibid.) manipulations, of a self-awareness so minute that it is uncomfortable to look at directly. Witness \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d another song that is supposedly about Kanye, in which she begins laughing too hard to sing when she talks about forgiving him. Witness \u201cEnd Game,\u201d in which she sings, \u201cOoooh, I got some big enemies.\u201d /nIf you watch the Netflix special that documents the \u201cReputation\u201d tour, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a moment when she looks around at the stadium cheering for her. Much has been made about the Taylor Swift Surprise Face, an aw-shucks meme that might have been its own impetus for cancellation in the first place \u2014 you\u2019re not allowed to show your surprise at your dominance during your dominance, even if you mean it. But what is the appropriate response to finding out that after your brutal death and your miraculous rebirth, you\u2019re still so, so beloved? You can see in her eyes that she wasn\u2019t just back in her fans\u2019 embrace; she was realizing, night after night, that she never left it./nEzra returned with some nachos. I don\u2019t want to brag, but he\u2019s a doctor now! He had gotten married and bought a co-op downtown. They toasted me at the wedding, he said, me in this endless line for T-shirts./nI saw someone draped in a sheet, and I wondered aloud if maybe it was someone who was afraid that her boss would see her skipping work for a concert. The young woman in front of me, a college student who had come in from Sacramento and was here for a second night in a row, said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s all the people that she ghosted in the room\u201d \u2014 a reference to \u201cAnti-Hero,\u201d a single from \u201cMidnights.\u201d/nThe college student told me that the night before, she\u2019d been \u201cbaptized\u201d \u2014 her word. She\u2019s in her 20s now, but she has been listening to Taylor Swift since she was a teenager. She used to sing her songs in front of a mirror, alone in her bedroom, and Taylor Swift was a part of her childhood, not just in the way you look back fondly, but in the ways you look back with embarrassment./n\u201cAll the ways you\u2019re so ashamed of the person you were right before this moment,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could so easily be ashamed of singing Taylor Swift in your bedroom. You could leave it behind. But she doesn\u2019t let you. She says, \u2018Look, I\u2019m getting older, too.\u2019 You grow with her. What if we weren\u2019t ashamed of our eras? What if we realized they were always with us, and you just didn\u2019t have to feel shame about who you were?\u201d She started crying; baby, I did, too./n\u201cMom,\u201d Ezra said, his aging eyes aglow. \u201cLook!\u201d /nI turned to see that we had arrived at the front of the line. It was 10 minutes to showtime. We had been in line for two and a half hours, but somehow there was still merch to be had \u2014 a miracle! Instead of the T-shirts we were planning to buy, I got us both hoodies. The air was warm, but we were old now, and we got cold more easily than we did before. /nThe sky turned into smeared unicorn pastels; it was in its \u201cLover\u201d era now. A perfect moon hung over the stadium, a beautiful satellite suspended over a limitless star. Below us, in a purple dress that looked like a cake topper, holding a blue guitar, Taylor pumped her fist and sang: \u201cLong live the walls we crashed through. How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you.\u201d/nI couldn\u2019t stop looking over my shoulder at the prom queen. Was I imagining her middle-distance stare? Please keep in mind that the answer is a resolute maybe with a high probability of probably. /nBut hear me out: I was thinking about what my new friend from Sacramento told me in the endless merch line. You could watch this concert \u2014 you could watch this entire phenomenon \u2014 through the eyes of the idea that Taylor Swift frees women to celebrate their girlhood, to understand that their womanhood is made up of these microchapters of change, that we\u2019re not different people than we were then, that we shouldn\u2019t disavow the earlier versions of ourselves, our earlier eras. /nIf you do look at it that way, you can also imagine why a young woman who tried to share Taylor Swift, this seminal part of her childhood, with the man she loves might have some feelings (again, this is conjecture! I might be making this up based on nothing more than a whim and a projection!) about the fact that he took a song she sang in her childhood bedroom and essentially hijacked it, making it about him and their relationship instead./n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of sex in this show,\u201d one of the HUSBANDs, the other one, said now. They had switched seats, and he was bored by the \u201cSpeak Now\u201d era. /n\u201cThat\u2019s because this isn\u2019t for you,\u201d I told him, and I found myself getting angry as I spoke. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t created to please you like the other women pop stars. She created herself to please me. She escaped the machine where women are only allowed to be pop stars if they don\u2019t anger or threaten men. This just isn\u2019t for you.\u201d/nHe squinted his eyes and furrowed his brow and pursed his lips and nodded like he understood, but I didn\u2019t care, and I turned away./nThe HUSBAND wasn\u2019t exactly wrong, though. No matter how grindy or seductive Taylor\u2019s dance moves can be, she is also making funny faces while she does them. During \u201cVigilante [Expletive],\u201d where the choreography isn\u2019t not like a burlesque show, she has a move where she puts one leg up on the seat of a chair. Sometimes, when she performs it, she puts her hand on her chest, fingers pointing south, and starts to slide it down as she sings, \u201cLately she\u2019s been dressing for revenge.\u201d But as her hand passes her solar plexus, she gives a scandalized \u201cWhat? Me?\u201d look and laughs with her audience. Her dancing is a combination of intricately executed choreography and the kind of literal-gesture dancing that has you put your thumb and pinkie to your head to indicate a phone call. /nIt\u2019s a form of dancing I haven\u2019t done in front of anyone for years; it\u2019s the kind of thing I used to do with a group of other young women or girls when there were no boys around, or at least no boys we cared to impress. That\u2019s what this entire concert reminded me of \u2014 time I spent in my own teenage bedroom, singing songs and pinballing between sexy stripper moves and goofy square dancing. Maybe that\u2019s what Eras really is: the acknowledgment of girls as people to memorialize, of who we are and who we were, all existing in the same body, on the same timeline. You are your sluttiest version, your silliest version, your most wholesome, your smartest, your dumbest, your saddest, your happiest \u2014 all at once. /nI looked back again at the prom king and queen. He meant well, the poor guy. He knew how much she loved Taylor Swift, probably, and that song in particular. I wonder if she\u2019d seen that TikTok/Instagram Reel where the entire wedding is jump-singing \u201cLove Story,\u201d and maybe one night she turned to him and said: \u201cLook at this. Isn\u2019t this something?\u201d Maybe a plan began to hatch in his head, and he stood over the computer during the Ticketmaster fiasco and figured out how to get two tickets. He landed in the republic of Section 301 knowing, just knowing, that this was going to be the moment. He was going to give her what she wanted. If you listen to Taylor Swift enough, you would think that this was what we wanted./nBut listen more carefully. Read the liner notes. Decipher the codes. Know your Taylor Swift history. Her songbook is really only minimally about romantic love, and the best part of romantic love, which is its moment of revelation. It\u2019s maximally about the other things that happen to a person in life: about the sometimes-questionable, sometimes-great, sometimes-tragic aftermath of that revelation, but it\u2019s also about loss and betrayal and friendship and revenge./nWitness Taylor Swift, in a white dress with sleeves that became what appeared, from where I was sitting, to be wings whenever she ran or danced, singing \u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d \u2014 a song that poses as a love song but is really about a different kind of devastation./nShe begins curled up on the floor, standing only as her backup dancers, dressed in funereal black, join her. She starts to walk slowly, and they follow her, looking down. In 2019, Scott Borchetta sold Big Machine \u2014 and, with it, her masters \u2014 to the talent manager Scooter Braun, a man she hated. According to a Tumblr post she wrote in June that year, Borchetta\u2019s company did give her the opportunity to get the masters back, but also insisted that, in exchange, she had to make a commensurate number of new albums, a kind of indentured servitude. She refused, and later announced that she would be rerecording her albums. The originals would be available still, but the new ones, the kosher ones, would be demarcated as \u201c(Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d/n\u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d is a heartbreaker. I cannot remember a song about business malfeasance that is so affecting, that would cause 64,000 people to scream on your behalf. It is one of the fiercest and best-crafted songs I\u2019ve ever heard./nEspecially the bridge. Taylor Swift loves bridges: The internet is rife not just with lists of and debates about the best bridges of her songs, but with videos of people sing-screaming those bridges as they run alongside the mechanism that\u2019s recording them. In particular, she loves the kind of bridge that changes the nature of the song, as in \u201cOut of the Woods,\u201d a song about a doomed relationship where the bridge returns to the perspective of not yet knowing it\u2019s doomed, or \u201cthe 1,\u201d where someone breezily catching an ex-lover up on her new life shifts to the tenser question beneath the interaction, about where exactly the relationship went wrong. /nThe bridge in \u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d goes like this:/nAnd I can go anywhere I wantAnywhere I want, just not homeAnd you can aim for my heart, go for bloodBut you would still miss me in your bonesAnd I still talk to you (when I\u2019m screaming at the sky)And when you can\u2019t sleep at night (you hear my stolen lullabies)/nImagine an entire football stadium singing about what a jerk you are. Imagine dozens and dozens of entirely-sold-out football stadiums singing about what a jerk you are./nShe has so far released three rerecorded albums. Some people say that she sounds older, or that she has less of the original emotion that fueled the songs in the first place, but that doesn\u2019t account for what an interesting postmodern experiment the whole enterprise is \u2014 Eras as proof of concept, a woman looking back on her youth to remember what she is made of, not with shame but with curiosity and even delight. It had never occurred to me to look back on even my most carefree and innocuous eras with anything but shame. /nOne can enter Swiftiedom at any level: avocation or vocation, background music or full-time job. Being a Swiftie at the highest level means access to an all-consuming, all-absorbing empire of evidence, where all the questions have answers, all the mysteries are solved, where you get to feel excited and smart and involved with something bigger than yourself without ever looking up from your phone. /nLet\u2019s go straight to that level. That\u2019s the level where we read the codes she leaves in her liner notes with random capital letters to equal the name of the guy that the song is about or a secret message. The level where she seems to indicate to her fans which album is being recorded next via a series of hidden images in an Instagram post. The level where, as I began writing this, legions of fans were crunching and computing and tabulating data to determine if (and why and how) the number 112 is significant when it comes to predicting the releases of her rerecordings./nTake the single \u201cKarma,\u201d off \u201cMidnights.\u201d In it, she sings, \u201cKarma is my boyfriend, Karma is a god, Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend. \u2026 Spider Boy, king of thieves, weave your little webs of opacity.\u201d As I write this, I have been glitter-pilled enough to not be able to see anything but this: \u201cBoyfriend\u201d is a song by Justin Bieber. \u201cGod is a woman\u201d is one by Ariana Grande; so is \u201cmy hair.\u201d Now: \u201csweet like justice,\u201d a lyric in that same song. \u201cSweetener\u201d is a Grande album; she has a perfume named Sweet Like Candy. \u201cJustice\u201d is a Bieber album. /nOn to \u201cSpider Boy\u201d: Both Grande and Bieber were clients of one Scooter Braun, who also shares his initials with Scott Borchetta. The song is called \u201cKarma\u201d! By the way, Grande and Bieber were among the clients reported to have dropped Scooter Braun as their manager on the day I wrote this sentence, which was also the anniversary of the announcement of the \u201cReputation\u201d album. (Additional reporting by 1,000 TikTok accounts and a million other sources I found on the internet, which was originally built for the military.)/nThis is the kind of thing you need to understand before you can begin to parse what happened with Karlie Kloss./nPeople had been telling Taylor Swift for years that she looked just like the model, that she reminded them of her, that they should meet. Her first public mention of Karlie Kloss is in a 2012 Vogue cover profile, where Taylor says that she loves Karlie Kloss and would like to bake cookies with her. Karlie tweeted in response to the Vogue quote: \u201cYour kitchen or mine?\u201d/nThe two became inseparable, taking pictures, dressing alike, dancing at concerts. Taylor gave a journalist a tour of her apartment in TriBeCa that included a room where Karlie stayed when she was over. Taylor sang at two Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion shows, the two of them sharing looks and holding hands at various points. /nBut then in 2016, Karlie Kloss punted on a press question about Kim Kardashian, saying that Kim had been \u201ca lovely person to me in the past.\u201d This was right after Snakegate; were things starting to fray? Then, in 2018, Karlie married Josh Kushner, and TAYLOR WAS NOT THERE. But you know who was? SCOOTER BRAUN! WHO IS KARLIE\u2019S FORMER MANAGER! /nA theory surfaced (one that I will continue to believe no matter what you tell me) that in a supplementary photo in the \u201cReputation\u201d album, Taylor\u2019s left eye had been replaced with Karlie Kloss\u2019s left eye. What is \u201cReputation\u201d but an album of coded regrets? What is revenge but exchanging an eye for an eye? I am worried I will be fired for even printing a draft of this theory, but I have examined this from all sides. The evidence is overwhelming! /nConsider the song off \u201cevermore\u201d called \u201cit\u2019s time to go.\u201d/nWhen the words of a sister Come back in whispersThat prove she was not In fact what she seemed,Not a twin from your dreamsShe\u2019s a crook who was caught/nThat\u2019s proof enough for me!/nThen there\u2019s \u201cMaroon,\u201d the beautiful second song on \u201cMidnights.\u201d It begins with the story of waking up the morning after a drunken night. But even before the first verse is up, it\u2019s clear that the story is a sad memory: \u201cI see you every day now\u201d is that first verse\u2019s wistful last line./nIt goes on to recount a breakup, and the various colors of those memories, the hues of residual anger and loss, but mostly the sadness that\u2019s left when the blush of love colored pink fades: \u201cI feel you no matter what,\u201d it goes. Then, almost in a yell, \u201cThe rubies that I gave up!\u201d /nIts bridge is a simple two lines repeated:/nAnd I wake with your memory over meThat\u2019s a real [expletive]ing legacy./nI can\u2019t remember the first time I saw the hashtag #kaylor; it\u2019s as if the fan theory that Taylor and Karlie were in a romantic relationship always existed, with all its half-clues and song codes and blurry video that asks if they\u2019re kissing. And maybe, I don\u2019t know, sure. But it\u2019s too simplistic to think of \u201cMaroon\u201d as a traditional romantic breakup song. I do think it\u2019s about Karlie Kloss, though. Like all of Taylor\u2019s songs, even the ones that absolutely probably are about her masters being sold to Scooter Braun, it\u2019s built like a love song. But I would submit that this isn\u2019t for subterfuge, or even to make the song more traditionally relatable. Instead, if this song is about Karlie Kloss, it is about the devastation of losing a best friend. /nI\u2019m not sure why it never occurred to me that there should be more songs about things that aren\u2019t romantic love, why I never thought we deserved more examination of the complex emotionality of the parts of our lives that exist outside it. I\u2019ll tell you, I never think about any of my ex-boyfriends, not ever. But I do think about the times I\u2019ve been screwed over in business by the people who were supposed to be taking care of me. And I do think about the best friends I\u2019ve lost in my lifetime \u2014 I wake with their memories over me. If I wrote songs, I\u2019d write about that. /nYou could say that Eras is cynical; you of course would discourage disavowing your past if you needed to remarket it to your audience. But look around this stadium. You don\u2019t enrapture an audience like this unless you\u2019re saying something real \u2014 something these legions of girls and women have been waiting to hear: that we are more than the moment on the balcony, where romance awaits. We are also everything before and after that. What Taylor Swift knows is that it\u2019s fun to sing about boys and men and romance, but that those moments when we stand on a balcony as the person we desire gallops toward us, or the moment that we win the affection of a person despite his allegiance to another, are only the smallest parts of a woman\u2019s life, no matter what the movies tell you. The ways that our trust and loyalty are weaponized against us is also the dominion of femaledom \u2014 the pain we feel over it, the way we can\u2019t ever quite forget. Those things are worth singing about, too. /nIt is probably true that Taylor Swift was too busy to talk to me. (It is also possible she didn\u2019t like something I wrote about her in the past?) It is almost certainly true that she didn\u2019t want to talk to me \u2014 celebrities rarely do. But what is definitely true is that she didn\u2019t need to talk to me. On the day I wrote this, Taylor Swift had 468 million followers across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, whereas The New York Times had a mere 92 million. Absent the usual publicity contract obligation, I honestly can\u2019t see a reason that someone who has revolutionized the relationship a singer can have with her fans should want an intermediary. Certainly she has sold enough albums without our help. /nBut also? I don\u2019t know if I could tell a story about Taylor Swift that\u2019s better than the story she tells about herself, through every song, every dance, every video, every social transmission. She is a master not just at the revelation of information but the analysis of each revelation, the scrutiny of that analysis, the contextualization of it all. The way this concert has consumed the world is the living embodiment of one destabilizing question to me: How could I interpret Taylor Swift better than she does, better than her fans do online, every day, without my interference or input? They\u2019re reading her codes, hunting down her clues, complying with her wishes, finding themselves in her world \u2014 a place that someone like me used to have the privilege of visiting alone. /nShe is inventing all of this in real time, and like other great inventions that cut out middlemen, this one might catch on. I\u2019ve watched in recent years as our biggest stars have forgone sitting for interviews in favor of Q. and A.s with an equally famous friend, with an agreed-upon set of softball questions, or, worse, an Instagram post. /nThis isn\u2019t a loss for them; for the most part, they\u2019ll be happy when the entire profile format is eradicated. I know this because over the last couple of years, I was on a leave of absence from The Times, and I worked with the exact kind of people I\u2019d written about for years \u2014 actors, directors, producers \u2014 and sometimes, when we got to chatting, they would tell me about the time they were profiled and it ruined their life, or a relationship, or caused an embarrassment that they carry with them still. Sometimes they told me about a lie they told an interviewer because they were scared or trying to misdirect the journalist. Not one person I ever interviewed seemed to understand why the public was so interested in them personally. They spent their time defensive, waiting for a sneaky question or worrying how I would subvert something innocent they were saying./nSo the loss isn\u2019t theirs, but ours \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s just mine. Because I like writing other things, but I love writing celebrity profiles. To me, there\u2019s no better way to understand the culture, and to understand the culture is to understand the world \u2014 to learn about ourselves by learning about the people we chose to celebrate, the people we voted to represent us in our own imaginations. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just too in my earnestness era. Maybe I\u2019m trying to call something a cultural shift when really it\u2019s just a personal one. And it\u2019s not even a big one: If profiles are over, I could, I don\u2019t know, cover whatever else it is that this magazine covers. I could go anywhere I want, just not home. What I\u2019m really saying is that once you go deep-state on Taylor \u2014 on the theories, on the codes, on the meanings \u2014 once you allow yourself to start thinking of your life in terms of eras, you can\u2019t help but find yourself in your very own Taylor Swift song. /nFar below us, Taylor Swift was singing about an affair. \u201cLook at this idiotic fool that you made me,\u201d the lyric goes, and I screamed it along with everyone else, but my voice cracked, and I found that I was crying again. /n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ezra asked./n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand!\u201d I sneered at him. \u201cYou\u2019re just an old man!\u201d/nI stood up so that a woman dressed as the scarf that Taylor Swift left at probably Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s house during her \u201cRed\u201d era could pass me on her way back from the concession stand. If this place looks a little like a comic-book convention or a clown car, that\u2019s because there are no transitions in eras. Eras end definitively and violently. They come while you\u2019re just trying to do your job and live your life, and one day you\u2019re sitting in Section 301, and you realize that the transition happened without you ever even realizing it. /nIf I did write songs, that would be the bridge. /nA little after 11:30 that night, the mayor declared her term over. The stage turned dark, and she sent the moon home, and the sovereign state of Section 301 of Swiftie Clara dissolved into a diaspora. /nBy the time she retired, the mayor had donated enough money to a local food bank to make a significant impact to the 500,000 people it feeds per month, as she did in every city she visited. She had increased tourism spending by an average of $3 million for each night she was there, relative to the nights when the stadium hosts a football game. She had made a material passive contribution to the economy of Santa Clara by selling out its hotel rooms and crashing its rideshare apps. It\u2019s estimated that her mere presence contributed more than $30 million to the local economy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wanted in on some of that action, so he tweeted at her to add some of that sweet Taylor Swift microeconomy to Canada; she complied by setting some dates in 2024. /nAutumn approached, and the wind picked up and blew all the glitter from the concert into the ocean, but just this once, the fish weren\u2019t angry. The usher I saw trade bracelets went home and wondered why football fans couldn\u2019t just enjoy themselves the way the Swifties did, why they had to get drunk and fight. Men with leaf blowers went out to extinguish all that the wind had left behind of the glitter, to transition the stadium back to its football era. /nAnd the police went back to arresting people. And a young woman lovingly hung a stuffed snake on her mirror. And the college student from Sacramento put Taylor back into her Spotify rotation, right there at the top. And the HUSBANDs, who I hope, along with everyone else in Section 301, will forgive me my hyperbole, went home and worked on their lats, and Ezra and I went home, too, but I still wear a beaded bracelet a woman gave me that says REPUTATION, and when I look at it I think: How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you. /nAnd Taylor Swift arrived in Los Angeles, the next stop on her U.S. tour. She was to play the first of six shows on Aug. 3, which I hope by now you know is Karlie Kloss\u2019s birthday, and what song that is not part of the regular Eras set list did she play as a surprise? SHE PLAYED \u201cMAROON\u201d! She played a song that we think is about Karlie Kloss ON KARLIE KLOSS\u2019S BIRTHDAY, and we were expected to go to sleep that night and to work the next day and care for our children and generally function amid the legion of algebraic calculations we were making in our heads. /nAnd then, at her last Los Angeles show, two crazy things happened. One was that she wore a series of previously unseen blue outfits, and blue is associated with \u201c1989\u201d for some reason, and this indicated that SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, and IT DID. She announced that since she was a teenager \u2014 I\u2019ll say 19 \u2014 she has always wanted to own her own music, and that now, on this day in August (which is the eighth month of the year), and this is the ninth day of that month, she would be releasing the rerecorded \u201c1989\u201d in October./nIf that is not enough \u2014 and it is, it is \u2014 let me tell you the other thing that happened:/nKARLIE! KLOSS! HERSELF! SHOWED! UP!/nYes, Karlie Kloss, who might not have been a romantic entanglement but could yes be called the love of her life, same as any of our best friends, came to the stadium and danced in the bleachers. The chaos this caused, the time I lost./nAnd meanwhile, I saw on TikTok that a woman whose handle is @nikkiking23 solved the 112 thing, and by this far in the story I will declare it basically undeniable. (SHE IS RELEASING ALBUMS IN 112-DAY CYCLES BECAUSE 112 IS THE NUMBER OF SONGS THAT WERE SOLD TO SCOOTER BRAUN WITHOUT HER PERMISSION!!!!!!!!!!!) /nAnd I sat at home, trying my best to return to those feelings I had in the stadium. I sat in the bathroom, on the floor, going through TikToks every night that recounted the concert. I was in my \u201cfolklore\u201d era by then, pensive and thinking about my life. I pitched an idea to my editor about the Real Housewives of New York trying to unionize. In the mornings, I waited till everyone was out of the house, and I sang songs from \u201cReputation\u201d \u2014 dirty but also silly. I haven\u2019t done that in years./nAnd somewhere in Northern California, the prom queen of Section 301 of the kingdom of Swiftie Clara opens the closet door in her bedroom and touches the purple dress she was wearing the night she got engaged, but really the night she was at the Taylor Swift concert. She puts on the dress and picks up her hairbrush and puts on \u201cLove Story,\u201d and she sings the song that was playing when she got engaged, the song that was a little bit taken from her that day even as it became a monumental part of her own permanent history. But even as she sings, even as she finds the old pleasure in the song, she remembers her time on the balcony of Section 301. She understands for the first time that those balcony moments are more fun to wait for than to live. Because once you live them, there starts a backward-counting clock in which the bedroom is no longer yours alone, and singing \u201cLove Story\u201d in your purple dress will make less and less sense. /nAnd that\u2019s when her pink landline phone rings. She answers it, and it\u2019s Taylor and me, conference-bombing her. We tell her that we\u2019re sorry that she has to move on. We tell her that it\u2019s sad that you don\u2019t get to decide to leave your eras, that the leaving is done for you. Time only moves forward, we say into the phone. You can\u2019t be a girl forever \u2014 they won\u2019t let you, and we all three have to grow and move on constantly. You will always have to leave a place before you\u2019re ready. You can go anywhere you want, we tell her in a reprise, just not home. /nShe cries into the phone, and we let her, me and Taylor \u2014 Taylor Swift, who sings the song of us all, who says all of this better than I ever could. I\u2019ll tell you, I like being a woman OK, but long live being a girl./n/nTaffy Brodesser-Akner is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine. More about Taffy Brodesser-Akner/nAdvertisement"

    "content": "Joey King's dogs will be in her heart on her wedding day. In an exclusive new interview with HELLO!, the Kissing Booth\u00a0star revealed why her rescues, Fable and Jesse James, won't have roles at her upcoming wedding to Steven Piet./n\"Those two are way too anxious to be around that many people,\u201d Joey, who has partnered with Hill's Pet Nutrition for NBCUniversal Local's Clear the Shelters 2023 campaign, said. \"I wish so badly, but Jesse James especially, if there's more than like 10 people in the room he's like, 'Alright, I'm putting myself to bed. This is too much.' And Fable- I don't even know if they would know where to look.\u201d\u00a0/n\"But in our hearts, they will be at our wedding and part of our wedding,\u201d she added./nFable and Jesse James'\u00a0pawrents, who are said to have met on the set of Hulu's The Act, got engaged last year. While the bride to be made a Pinterest board for her big day back when she was young, she did not end up using it for her wedding inspiration./n\"It's disgusting,\u201d Joey said of her old Pinterest board. \"It's so ugly. It's like the ugliest thing you could ever imagine. I was wondering if it was any good when we got engaged. I was like, 'Let me go take a look at that' and I was like 'Nope.' So I created a new one.\u201d/nThankfully, Joey has Alison Bryan Destinations helping her with the wedding planning. \"They're the best. But I have to say, I've kind of enjoyed the stuff that people were like 'That's gonna stress you out,'\u201d the Ramona and Beezus actress admitted. \"I mean, at the end of the day, I'm planning what's supposed to be one of the most loving parties of my life, so like what could be that stressful that makes me take myself out of the experience of how loving it is.\u201d/nContinue reading to find out what Joey King had to say about herself as a bride, plus her bachelorette party and Taylor Swift\u2026\u00a0/nYou adopted your dog Fable earlier this year and now you've teamed up with Hill's Pet Nutrition for the Clear the Shelters 2023 campaign. It seems like a paws-itively perfect partnership. I would love to know, what sparked your passion for animal advocacy?\u00a0/nI genuinely have never not had a dog. I love animals so much and I've always had a pet in my home and that's something that I will continue, I think, for the rest of my life. Animals provide such a beautiful peace. It's like a puzzle piece that's missing until you have one and you don't even know how much they can enrich your life and how rewarding it is \u2014especially to adopt an animal and watch their personality change and become more comfortable and more quirky and happy. It's amazing. So partnering with Hill's Pet just felt so natural because their mission is just beautiful and I just can't believe all the amazing work they've done over the years housing over 13 million cats and dogs through the Clear the Shelters campaign. So I'm very, very honored that they wanted me to partner with them and come volunteer today to help take some photos of these dogs to get them adopted./nMORE: Did you know these stars were besties?\n/nIs Fabel your first rescue or had you rescued other pets before?/nFabel is technically my first rescue, but my fianc\u00e9 and I have a dog named Jesse James, who was technically Steven's dog, but now he's of course our dog, but he's also a rescue as well.\u00a0/nWhat breed is Fable?\u00a0/nThis is a funny one because I was like \"What is she?\u201d She has kind of a Border Collie face, but also like a Siberian Husky body and like all these- she could be a shepherding dog like I don't know. So we bought the DNA kit and we did it and we're like, \"Oh my God, we're so excited. Like what is she gonna be? Oh my God, we can't wait to find out!\u201d And then we got the results back and it was so disappointing because it just said 100 percent Eastern European village dog and we were like, \"What does that mean? What does that even mean?\u201d So we googled it and it turns out that it's like, it's just all these different breeds like Siberian Husky, Border Collie. It could be anything and I was like, \"We paid $200 for this\u201d... We were like, \"Okay, great. We could have told you that.\u201d/nYou've no doubt have changed Fable's life by rescuing her. So I'm curious, how has Fable changed your life?/nOh my God. I mean, I'm such an animal lover. When I first met Fable, I was volunteering at a shelter in Romania. I just missed my dog Jesse at home and I was wanting to play with some dogs and get some dog energy and Fable immediately broke my heart. You could just tell she was really sad. She needed some TLC in her life. And so having her and watching her blossom into this funny dog that's happy \u2026 she was so petrified of dogs when we first got her, now she loves dogs. It's so rewarding and so fulfilling. She's changed my life because I feel like she's so much happier and I'm so much happier because of that. Like her successes are my successes. I'm so proud of her and how far she's come and she's got a long way to go in terms of like comfortability and her anxiousness, but like I think she's perfectly imperfect. That's what makes her so great is that she has her own personality. Dogs always provide such a beautiful perspective on life. They're such simple, loving creatures and they're innately so good-hearted. Even if you meet an aggressive dog, chances are they are innately good, they're just scared. You have to just be patient. Animals are innately good./nMORE: All about celebrity pets\n/nWill Fable and Jesse James have roles at your wedding?/nOh my God, I wish. Those two are way too anxious to be around that many people. I wish so badly, but Jesse James especially, if there's more than like 10 people in the room he's like, \"Alright, I'm putting myself to bed. This is too much.\u201d And Fable- I don't even know if they would know where to look\u2026 But in our hearts, they will be at our wedding and part of our wedding.\u00a0/nHow's the wedding planning going? Are you done, halfway there?/nIt's going very well. I have not found the process to be too stressful, but I also have to credit that to our amazing wedding planners Alison Bryan Destinations. They're the best. But I have to say, I've kind of enjoyed the stuff that people were like \"That's gonna stress you out.\u201d At the end of the day, I'm planning what's supposed to be one of the most loving parties of my life./nRELATED: The biggest celeb wedding of all time?/nYour bridesmaids must love that it's not stressful, because then it is not stressful for them!/nExactly! I only have\u2026 only my sisters. That's it. That's all I'm having. So I only have two.\u00a0/nI saw you had your bachelorette party. What was a highlight for you?/nOh man. It's mean, but it's not mean. My sister threw up and it was really funny. She drank too much wine, and then we got in the car and then I took a photo of her on the airplane with her sunglasses on. She now thinks it's funny, so it's okay to laugh at it. But also just getting together with my best pals, and my sisters planned the most detailed, beautiful weekend. They put so much thought into it. I felt so loved. My sisters planned it so well. It was just thing after thing after thing: games, wine tasting, dinner. We had so much going on and it was the most relaxing, loving weekend with some of my favorite people in the whole world.\u00a0/nHow would you describe yourself as a bride?/nI would describe myself as someone who initially says they don't have a lot of opinions and then when presented with options all of a sudden has tons of opinions. I'm one of those people where I'm like, \"Yeah, like I'm pretty easygoing\u201d and then like I realized, I'm like \"Maybe I'm not so easygoing, actually.\u201d\u00a0/nDid you have that idea already in your mind or did you go in open-minded? \u00a0/nI did not have lots of ideas. I had a Pinterest board that I made when I was young and it's disgusting. It's the ugliest thing you could ever imagine. I was wondering if it was any good when we got engaged. I was like, \"Let me go take a look at that\u201d and I was like \"Nope.\u201d So I created a new one. But honestly, I was open because I knew that like, you know, it's a little complicated. It's not so cut and dry, you can get everything you want. There's a lot of things that go into the vendors that you choose and chances are someone's gonna have something beautiful that you mesh with and you vibe with.\u00a0/nWhat would you say you're most looking forward to on your wedding day?/nMarrying Steven! He's the best./nSwitching gears\u2026You joined Taylor Swift onstage at her Eras Tour. Can you talk to us about that experience? \u00a0/nIt was pretty amazing. I've never experienced anything like that. It was incredible to be there and to experience all that energy on stage. I was saying, the best way to describe it is like it's like when you get into an ice bath. It literally takes your breath away for a moment. It's like such a shock. Like that's how it felt when I walked on stage. It was like such a shock. And so exhilarating just having all those people. It's such a niche thing to experience, but I really soaked in every second. It was incredible.\u00a0/nOn Instagram after that night, you wrote that Taylor has been a huge figure in your life since you guys met when you were nine. Had you guys kept in touch ever since you appeared in the \"Mean\u201d video?/nWe have. You know how friends who travel a lot, you have very long stretches where you don't talk all the time at all, but like she's so lovely. She's always made it a priority to check in and it's so lovely. And I just feel very lucky to have been able to be part of the Speak Now (Taylor's Version) era. And having that history when I worked on the music video \"Mean\u201d with her. It's incredible to see how I've changed as a person and to see how she's changed. She's a magical person\u2026 She's just dominating right now. She's absolutely on top of the world, but the best part about her is that she just genuinely loves what she does and you can see that in everything she does. She's a true master of her craft and she like loves her fans. It's beautiful./nYou also reunited with Taylor Lautner for the \"I Can See You\u201d music video. How hard was it to keep that a secret?/nOh man. Yeah, that was tough. That was exciting\u2026 very, very exciting. I shot that like in between something I was doing and it was just so much fun to be able to go and do that with her. Like you said, it was like you're like bursting at the seams. You can't wait for it to come out. But luckily I didn't have to wait too long. It came out in July, so I was excited. I was excited to be able to see it pretty quickly afterwards given how long things often take.\u00a0/nTRENDING: Did you know who this famous star's husband is...?\n/nDid your sisters know or your fianc\u00e9? Did you let them in on the secret or were they equally surprised when it dropped?\u00a0/nNo, they knew! They did know. They were like the only people I told though, like genuinely, because I didn't want it to like get out or anything, but my sisters and my man, I was like \"Okay guys, gather around and don't tell a soul.\u201d Those people are the only people that really had to know because well Steven was with me, but then the other two, they have my location and they're like where are you?/nWill there be Taylor Swift music at the wedding?/nI mean, duh, right?... It wouldn't be a party without T.S. music./nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity./n"

The city, not so much./nNow, Santa Clara is issuing a $2,000 fine against Pyrotek, the pyrotechnics company used by Swift, for setting off the fireworks after 11 p.m./nThe city has an 11 p.m. curfew for concerts at Levi\u2019s Stadium, but Swift ended her show at 11:38 p.m. on Friday and 11:26 p.m. on Saturday, capping off her three-and-a-half-hour show with her hit song \u201cKarma\u201d from her 2022 album \u201cMidnights\u201d and a stream of fireworks behind her./nIn an email, Santa Clara spokesperson Michelle Templeton said city staff is also reviewing whether there will be any other fines levied for the curfew-breaking show. But even if haters gonna hate, Swift herself will shake it off as it is the San Francisco 49ers \u2014 who manage the stadium for non-NFL events \u2014 who pay curfew-related fines, not the artists themselves./n\u201cAny noise ordinance violations will be determined after a post-event review of recorded noise levels and noise complaints,\u201d Templeton said. \u201cCompiling this information may take a couple weeks.\u201d/nShe said that previous concert fines for noise and curfew violations have ranged from $750 to $2,100. The Santa Clara Police Department\u2019s dispatch didn\u2019t receive any noise complaints for either of Swift\u2019s concert dates, Templeton noted./nBut while the jury is still out on whether the 49ers will incur a fine on Swift\u2019s behalf, the city is taking action against Pyrotek for violating its permit by setting off fireworks after 11 p.m. The pyrotechnics company, which has done work for other artists such as Jennifer Lopez and the Jonas Brothers, will be fined $2,000 \u2014 $1,000 per night. Members of the Pyrotek team could not immediately be reached for comment./nThe curfew at Levi\u2019s Stadium has been a point of contention for years. In 2021, the Santa Clara City Council voted to extend weeknight curfews for five shows a year from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. The weekend curfew for Friday and Saturday, however, remained at 11 p.m./nWhile the city is still weighing whether or not to fine the 49ers over the curfew, Mayor Lisa Gillmor asserted that the team will be fined./n\u201cThese neighborhood protections were agreed to by the 49ers and the city as conditions of development of the stadium,\u201d Gillmor wrote in an email. \u201cIt was a compromise for building a stadium near residential areas. Keeping in mind that it takes approximately two to four hours after an event to clear the stadium, these protections are reasonable for our residents.\u201d/nA spokesperson for Levi\u2019s Stadium said in a statement that they are \u201cfocused on what\u2019s actually important here \u2014The Eras Tour brought millions of dollars in economic impact to Santa Clara\u2019s local businesses, residents, and working families, and entertained more than 100,000 fans. We\u2019re grateful Taylor Swift chose to perform at Levi\u2019s Stadium and can\u2019t wait to welcome other major artists to our community in the coming weeks.\u201d/nCouncilmember Suds Jain didn\u2019t weigh in on whether the city should issue the 49ers a fine but said he would be open to looking at a change in the weekend curfew./n\u201cIf we can get these big shows and make some money for the city, it\u2019s something the city could look at,\u201d he said./nRelated Articles\nMusic |  \n\n\t\t\tTravis Kelce says he\u2019ll be having a Thanksgiving dinner of KFC without Taylor Swift\t\t\n\n\nMusic |  \n\n\t\t\tThe holidays push Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce to new relationship milestone\t\t\n\n\nMusic |  \n\n\t\t\tEverything you need to know about the Taylor Swift themed Cruise\t\t\n\n\nMusic |  \n\n\t\t\t\u2018Best husband\u2019 pays for dozens of strangers to join his wife at Taylor Swift movie\t\t\n\n\nMusic |  \n\n\t\t\tGrammy nominations 2024: Here are the top nominees\t\t\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers have alleged in the past that the curfew has cost the city millions in revenue. In 2017, Ed Sheeran dropped Levi\u2019s Stadium from his tour dates because of the 10 p.m. curfew. His current tour, however, is set to come to Santa Clara next month./nThe city has issued citations in the past for breaking the Levi\u2019s Stadium curfew, fining the 49ers $1,000 each time in 2017 after both U2 and Coldplay broke the 10 p.m. curfew./nThe fine against Pyrotek, and the possibility of another one yet to come for the 49ers, is in stark contrast with city officials\u2019 attitude towards Swift\u2019s visit over the last several weeks./nSanta Clara rolled out the red carpet for the pop star, making her honorary mayor and ceremonially renaming the city \u201cSwiftie Clara.\u201d Swift even addressed the accolades during her second night at Levi\u2019s Stadium./n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice of your city to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cVery, very cute. It\u2019s certainly wonderful because I have missed you so much. I haven\u2019t seen you guys in like five years in this capacity.\u201d"

Prices start at $19.89 for adults and $13.13 for children, substantially less than what fans paid for the tour itself \u2014 especially on the robust secondary market \u2014 as the concert industry adjusts to sometimes prohibitively high costs for its biggest events./nSwift, 33, wrapped this year\u2019s North American dates with four shows in Mexico last week. Her downtime, though, will be brief. In addition to the movie version of the concert, the singer will release \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d the fourth of rerecorded original albums, two weeks later, on Oct. 27. By November, the Eras Tour will pick up in Argentina before traveling around the world in 2024, with dates \u2014 including nine additional U.S. shows \u2014 continuing into November 2024./n\u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d the new edition of her 2014 pop blockbuster, marks Swift\u2019s seventh release in barely three years, a period of artistic productivity that has fueled pent-up, post-pandemic demand for the singer\u2019s live show. Jon Caramanica, a critic for The New York Times, said in a review of the first concert in March that the Eras Tour put on display \u201chow many pivots Swift has undertaken in her career, and how the accompanying risks can have wildly different consequences.\u201d/nThe trade publication Pollstar has estimated that the singer sold about $14 million in tickets for each show so far. By the end of next year, the 146 stadium dates could reach $1.4 billion or more in sales./nJoe Coscarelli is a culture reporter with a focus on popular music, and the author of \u201cRap Capital: An Atlanta Story.\u201d More about Joe Coscarelli/nAdvertisement"

When you searched for Israel, the site automatically kicked users to other areas in the Middle East ... like Lebanon./nAs a result, a lot of people started jumping to conclusions, and speculating that Taylor and/or her team had done this intentionally ... as a way to signal their stance on Israel-Palestine./nOf course, Taylor's close friendship with Gigi Hadid -- with whom she had just dined this past weekend -- also jumped into people's minds ... as they assumed this (would-be) move to yank the flick in Israeli theaters was a result of GH getting into T-Swift's ear on this issue./nThat couldn't be further from the truth though ... because, as of right now -- people can access those Israel tickets from her site ... and we have an explanation for what happened that made it inaccessible in the first place./nAs it turns out ... we're told there's actually a third-party company that deals with posting Taylor's worldwide showtimes on her official 'Eras' movie website -- aka, this isn't something she or her team deal with themselves./nIt's unclear what the holdup was in uploading this week's showtimes ... but rest assured it was merely a delay on the third-party company's part, and we're told the issue has now been rectified -- with showings available for purchase in and around Israel./nLong story short ... there is NO political statement that Taylor is trying to take here, and she was NOT trying to stick it to Israel over what's going on in Gaza./nWe did extra digging on this to make sure it wasn't just a pivot only after people noticed, BTW ... because even while tickets in Israel were temporarily not available to the public on TS's site, we confirmed you could still go to individual Israeli theater chains/sites and purchase tickets there -- which just speak to this someone dragging their feet by mistake./nIt's all fixed now, though ... and Israeli Taylor fans can enjoy her this week as well. Her movie screens Thursday through Sunday -- so go reserve your seats, if you're inclined."

The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we\u2019ve leaned into in real time, as it\u2019s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we\u2019ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport./nThe vast majority of our content has remained focused on the game, our players and variety of other initiatives, including our Toy Story Funday Football alt-cast, the international games and more./nIt's hard to blame the league for attempting to target a previously underserved demographic, though. The Chiefs' win over the Bears ranked first among TV viewers in the 18-49 female demographic, which seems to be something of a rarity for the male-viewer-dominated sport./nSunday night's NBC broadcast cut to Swift and friends in her luxury box roughly 17 times throughout the course of the game, seemingly taking away from the focus of the on-field product. It turned out to be a highly entertaining matchup between the two teams, resulting in a 23-20 KC win over the Jets./nMORE: Travis Kelce jersey sales skyrocket after 'SNF' game/nThe NFL also announced that the \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup between the Jets and Chiefs produced 27 million viewers./nIt's safe to say not all of them tuned in to watch Zach Wilson./nJoe Rivera is a senior content producer at The Sporting News and teaches Multimedia Sports Reporting at his alma mater, Rutgers University."

    "content": "Advertisement/nSupported by/nThere\u2019s something in the singer\u2019s highly anticipated new concert documentary for newcomers and superfans alike./nBy Kyle Buchanan/nReporting from Los Angeles/nAs she greeted the audience at the premiere of her new movie, Taylor Swift sounded a bit sheepish./n\u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me, because I\u2019m going to sit with you and watch this thing,\u201d she told the crowd at the packed premiere of \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d held at the sprawling Grove shopping complex on Wednesday night. Well, one of the crowds, anyway: Thirteen of the theaters at the Grove\u2019s AMC multiplex were filled with eager fans, and Swift stopped by all of them to give a special introduction, eventually settling into an auditorium\u2019s audience that included stars like Adam Sandler and Julia Garner./nRegular moviegoers can only hope that an apologetic Swift shows up for more house calls as her concert documentary makes its way into theaters this week. Though it was originally set for release on Friday, Swift just announced that the film will begin screening one day early because of fan demand./nStill, even if they can\u2019t watch \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d alongside the singer herself \u2014 who came to the premiere in a pale blue Oscar de la Renta gown and danced in her seat for most of its running time \u2014 the movie is poised to deliver in a major way./nFor theatrical exhibitors, whose business has been in jeopardy since the actors strike scuttled plans to release tentpole movies like \u201cDune\u201d this fall, \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d is being likened to the second coming of Barbenheimer: It\u2019s got the grab-your-besties-and-go appeal of \u201cBarbie,\u201d the shock-and-awe soundscape of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and the box-office tracking to rival them both. Bullish film analysts expect an opening weekend between $150 to $200 million, meaning \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d has a shot at taking this year\u2019s box-office tiara from \u201cBarbie,\u201d which notched a $162 million debut./nIn the meantime, here are four of the takeaways from the premiere./nIf fans are looking for insight into how Swift put her show together, or what was going on in her life behind the scenes, they won\u2019t find it in \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d: There is no additional embroidering in this concert documentary, which was culled from Swift\u2019s six-night August stint at the SoFi stadium in Inglewood, a suburb of Los Angeles. For those who caught one of the 53 shows Swift played in North America this past year, or for the fans hoping to see Swift in her remaining American dates (an international tour begins in February), this film is more or less the same thing as buying a concert ticket./nThere\u2019s one crucial difference, of course: No stadium seat could offer as close a look at Swift\u2019s performance as this documentary, which is vigorously shot and directed by Sam Wrench. And since the 33-year-old singer designed \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d as a journey through the shifting musical genres of her past 10 albums \u2014 from the country-pop \u201cFearless\u201d all the way up to the recent, stripped-down records \u201cFolklore,\u201d \u201cEvermore\u201d and \u201cMidnights\u201d \u2014 this film is the closest thing that exists to a definitive document of one of the world\u2019s biggest performers./nIn that way, it\u2019s perfect viewing for newcomers and superfans alike: Curious people who were unwilling to shell out for tour prices can now check out Swift at a reduced rate, while Swifties who\u2019ve already attended the concert can relive it in a compelling close-up. My teenage niece, who went to one of the SoFi shows, accompanied me to the premiere and was thrilled by the better look at Swift\u2019s facial expressions and choreography. I noticed that hardly a song goes by without some big smiles from Swift and her backup singers: There\u2019s enough joy on these faces to power entire blocks of Barbie Land./n\u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d runs a robust two hours and forty-eight minutes, and though that\u2019s nearly as long as \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d Swift\u2019s real-life concerts during this tour were even more mammoth, typically clocking in just shy of three and a half hours. Do fans have reason to fear there have been major cuts to the set list?/nBy my count, only a handful of her regular songs go missing on the way to the big screen, including \u201cThe Archer,\u201d \u201cCardigan,\u201d \u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d and \u201cno body no crime,\u201d which Swift performed at SoFi with the band Haim./nStill, fans will get plenty of bang for their buck, since Swift performs nearly 40 songs during the movie, including a 10-minute version of \u201cAll Too Well\u201d and two other bonus tunes, \u201cOur Song\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re On Your Own, Kid,\u201d that Swift plucked from a rotating selection of surprise songs during her tour. And another trim is sure to be appreciated: Swift now moves between the different eras and costume changes in the blink of an eye onscreen, eliding all the time those segues took onstage./nBlockbuster premieres have been hard to come by since the actors strike began, and an eclectic cross-section of celebrities turned out for the \u201cEras Tour\u201d premiere, including Sandler, Mariska Hargitay and the singers Maren Morris and Hayley Kiyoko. Fashion choices ran the gamut from silver sequins to cowgirl fringe, and Alex Atallah, a co-founder of the NFT marketplace OpenSea, entered the theater lobby sporting the colorful, tie-dyed \u201cI Am Kenough\u201d hoodie seen on Ryan Gosling in \u201cBarbie.\u201d/n\u201cI have very few shirts with this many pastel colors,\u201d Atallah told me before posing for a photo with the \u201cBarbie\u201d co-star Simu Liu./nNearby, I caught Flavor Flav deep in conversation with Swift\u2019s father, Scott. Though they made for an unlikely duo, the 64-year-old rap icon is no fly-by-night fan: He said that he\u2019d seen the \u201cawesome\u201d Swift on two previous tours./n\u201cI\u2019ve been a Swiftie for the longest, bro,\u201d Flav insisted./nBut Swift\u2019s biggest invite was reserved for another A-lister (and no, it wasn\u2019t her new beau Travis Kelce, busy with a football game the next day): Before the premiere began, Swift dined and posed for pictures with Beyonc\u00e9, who has her own concert movie \u201cRenaissance: A Film By Beyonc\u00e9\u201d due for release on Dec. 1. Like \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s film bypassed traditional Hollywood studios and will be distributed by AMC Theaters./nThough she\u2019s a superstar in the music industry, Swift\u2019s forays into film haven\u2019t been as well-received. Her last three movie credits as an actress include the minor young-adult drama \u201cThe Giver,\u201d the memorably cataclysmic adaptation of \u201cCats,\u201d and last year\u2019s David O. Russell-directed \u201cAmsterdam,\u201d which coaxed Swift to pop in for a quick cameo and then promptly ran her over./nUnlike Lady Gaga, who has lately toggled between music and movies in equal measure, Swift has treated Hollywood as more of a side hustle, only committing to the occasional supporting role. But last year, after she signed a deal with Searchlight to write and direct an upcoming original film, eyebrows were raised all over town: Was Swift ready to take her movie career a bit more seriously?/nIt remains to be seen whether Swift will star in her feature directorial debut, but \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d still supplies her with some much-needed big-screen juice. A fun presence in her biggest numbers, like the bouncy \u201cShake It Off\u201d and rocking \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d Swift is even more appealing in acoustic numbers that trade busy choreography for simple guitar playing. And in the centerpiece song \u201cTolerate It,\u201d she shows acting chops during a well-choreographed routine about a dinner date gone wrong: It begins with her beseeching an inexpressive lover and ends with her swatting a vase of roses off the table./nHer real talent, though, is selling humility with a megawatt charisma that few celebrities can muster. Introducing one song, Swift insists she had to invent an outsized version of herself in order to write it: \u201cIn my fantasy, I\u2019m not a lonely millennial woman covered in cat hair,\u201d the singer says, even though she\u2019s spent the whole film looking impossibly glamorous in sky-high Christian Louboutin heels./nAnd yet, you\u2019re still tempted to believe her. What is that, if not a movie star?/nKyle Buchanan is a pop culture reporter and serves as The Projectionist, the awards season columnist for The Times. He is the author of \u201cBlood, Sweat & Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road.\u201d More about Kyle Buchanan/nAdvertisement"

After Taylor was spotted stepping out with Brittany Mahomes, Sophie Turner, and Blake Lively, Mahomes seems to have lost a friend. According to Page Six, Travis\u2019 ex Kayla Nicole\u00a0pointedly unfollowed her former close friend Brittany, along with Brittany\u2019s husband Patrick Mahomes, and Mahomes\u2019 brother Jackson, on\u00a0Instagram. The outlet noted that Brittany, Jackson, and Patrick all still follow Kayla, despite the snub./nBrittany, Taylor, Sophie, and Blake had dinner together in New York in an epic girl\u2019s night out on Friday, September 29. On Twitter, fans lit up with speculation over the apparent post-outing diss. \u201cKayla Nicole unfollowed Brittany Mahomes on Instagram after her dinner with T Swift. \u00a0I should not be proud to be this invested, but here I am,\u201d confessed a fan. Another lamented via Twitter, \u201cI\u2019m so heartbroken over this.\u201d\u00a0/nOthers were more sympathetic to Kayla\u2019s actions. \u201cOOP! Kayla Nicole unfollowed Brittany Mahomes on insta. As she should! But Brittany still follows her,\u201d a fan observed.\u00a0/nKayla and Brittany, the wife of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, were famously close pals prior to the incident. In fact, Kayla was a bridesmaid at Patrick and Brittany\u2019s lavish wedding celebration in Hawaii in March of 2022. Kayla and Travis had a rocky, on-off relationship beginning in 2017 and finally ending for good in May of 2022./nAt the time of their split, it was alleged that the on-air sports reporter was forced to pay for \u201chalf of everything\u201d during the relationship, despite the NFL star\u2019s wealth. Travis, however, hit back at the narrative personally./n\u201cDon\u2019t buy into that s***,\u201d he said during a January 2023 appearance on The Pivot Podcast. \u201cI would never say that I was supporting her,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe had a very financially stable life and what she was doing in her career.\u201d/nHe also claimed to have helped her financially from time to time. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be crazy if you\u2019d think I would never helped or gave her a couple thousand to grab some food or she gave me some money to go get some food\u2026. we were in a relationship for five years,\u201d he added. \u201cA hundred dollars here, a hundred dollars there wasn\u2019t even thought about.\u201d"

    "content": "Taylor Swift, the pop sensation known for her chart-topping hits and captivating performances, is making headlines once again. This time, it\u2019s not just for her music, but for her incredible generosity towards the hardworking crew members of her Eras Tour. Swift has decided to show her appreciation to the dedicated truck drivers who have been instrumental in the success of her tour by surprising them with life-changing bonuses of $100,000 each./nGoing Above and Beyond/nTaylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour has been a massive success, captivating audiences across the United States. Behind the scenes, a dedicated team of professionals works tirelessly to ensure that everything runs smoothly. Among them are the tour\u2019s truck drivers, who play a crucial role in transporting the stage and structure to each concert venue. These drivers, often away from their families for weeks at a time, work long hours in demanding conditions./nRecognizing their hard work and sacrifice, Taylor Swift wanted to express her gratitude in a truly meaningful way. In a surprise meeting during what the drivers thought was a routine production meeting, Swift\u2019s father, Scott Swift, made an unexpected appearance. He revealed that Taylor had decided to give each trucker a bonus of $100,000, an amount far beyond the standard expected bonus of $5,000 to $10,000. This gesture not only exceeded expectations but also had a profound impact on the lives of these hardworking individuals./nLife-Changing Generosity/nFor the truck drivers who have dedicated their time and energy to the Eras Tour, the $100,000 bonus is truly life-changing. Michael Scherkenbach, the founder and CEO of Shomotion trucking company, which is one of two transportation companies used by the tour, described the impact of this unexpected windfall. He explained that these men and women live on the road, sleeping during the day and working all night. The grueling nature of their job means they often have to leave their families, including young children, for extended periods./nReceiving a $100,000 bonus opens up new possibilities for these hardworking individuals. It can serve as a down payment on a house or cover the cost of college tuition for their children. Scherkenbach emphasized that a fair wage alone would not provide them with such opportunities. Taylor Swift\u2019s generous gesture has also given these truck drivers a chance to achieve financial security and fulfill dreams they might not have thought possible./nA Surprise Worth Waiting For/nThe truck drivers were completely taken aback when they were called into what they believed to be a routine production meeting. Little did they know that they were about to receive life-changing news. Scott Swift, accompanied by other members of the Taylor family, addressed the drivers and expressed their appreciation for their hard work and dedication. Taylor herself had personally written a handwritten note to each driver, sealed with her monogrammed wax seal. Inside each envelope was a check stating the amount of the bonus, along with the corresponding tax documents./nThe drivers, initially hesitant to look at the amount, were overwhelmed by the generosity they had received. Scherkenbach shared that one driver thought it said $1,000, another believed it was $10,000, and a third suspected it was a joke. However, the reality of the situation quickly sank in as they realized the magnitude of Taylor Swift\u2019s gift. This unexpected bonus was not only a financial boost but also a testament to the appreciation and recognition they had earned through their hard work./nAcknowledging the Entire Team/nTaylor Swift\u2019s generosity extended beyond the truck drivers. Other members of the tour crew, including those in catering, video, audio, and lighting, also received bonuses for their contributions. This comprehensive approach highlights Swift\u2019s commitment to recognizing and valuing the efforts of every individual involved in making her tour a success./nThe positive impact of Taylor Swift\u2019s generosity goes beyond monetary value. It creates a sense of camaraderie and appreciation within the tour\u2019s crew, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment.

He announced that Taylor had decided to give each trucker a bonus of $100,000, far exceeding the standard expected bonus./nThe truck drivers were initially hesitant to look at the amount of the bonus.

However, they soon realized the magnitude of Taylor Swift\u2019s gift and were overwhelmed by her generosity./nFor the truck drivers who have dedicated their time and energy to the Eras Tour, the $100,000 bonus is life-changing. It can serve as a down payment on a house or cover the cost of college tuition for their children, opening up new possibilities and providing financial security./nNo, Taylor Swift\u2019s generosity extended to other members of the tour crew as well. Those in catering, video, audio, and lighting also received bonuses for their contributions to the success of the Eras Tour./nTaylor Swift\u2019s extraordinary generosity demonstrates her commitment to recognizing and appreciating the hard work of those behind the scenes.

    "content": "When it comes to buying last-minute tickets to see Taylor Swift at SoFi Stadium, don\u2019t be the foolish one./nSometimes there are great deals to be had for buyers in the right place at the right time. But there are far more scammers looking for overeager fans than legitimate sellers willing to unload tickets at below the going rate./nIf money is no object, you can find tickets for any of the remaining sold-out shows in Inglewood through legitimate ticket brokers and resellers online, like StubHub, Vivid Seats and SeatGeek. These platforms offer money-back guarantees if your ticket turns out to not be valid (StubHub even pledges to try to get you in the door anyway and into a real seat). On Monday, for example, the least-expensive ones at StubHub.com were $843, and that was for seats in the upper deck or behind the stage./nAnd resale prices may come down more, if history is any guide. The New York Post reported that ticket reseller Vivid Seats saw prices for Eras Tour tickets in five other cities drop 50% at the last minute \u2014 although that\u2019s 50% off the considerably higher resale price, not the original. /nNevertheless, hope springs eternal for ticketless Swifties, which is why you\u2019ll find plenty of anecdotes online about tickets released at the last minute for sale at or below face value, or unloaded on the cheap by a desperate seller. And there are some groups out there dedicated to helping Swifties obtain tickets at face value or less \u2014 see, for example, @ErasTourResell on the social network formerly known as Twitter./nBefore leaping at an offer that seems to fulfill your wildest dreams, however, consider the advice from experts on how to avoid being sold a worthless fake./n Entertainment & Arts /nParking! Public transit! Fan chants! Friendship bracelets! Everything you need to know before you see Taylor Swift at SoFi Stadium for the L.A. stops of her Eras tour./nAug. 4, 2023/nThe most common piece of advice: Don\u2019t buy a ticket directly from an individual whom you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s far safer to buy from a reseller such as StubHub, which offers protection against scammy sellers. But that protection comes at a premium price./nSimply buying through a third-party platform like a Facebook group or Craigslist isn\u2019t enough, because the safeguards offered buyers vary from site to site. (And some, like Craigslist, don\u2019t offer any because they\u2019re simply advertising platforms, not ticket exchanges.) Worse, some scammers create fraudulent resale platforms to pull off their cons. /nNever trust a link to a site sent via text, email or social media; not only might the link take you to a webpage loaded with malware, it could also send you to an expertly crafted knockoff designed to look just like a well-known reseller\u2019s site./nAs the U.S. Public Interest Research Group notes in its guide to avoiding ticket scams, \u201cA scammer can, for example, create a website with the URL: TlCKETMASTER.COM Did you notice that URL contains a lower-case L and not an I? Betcha didn\u2019t.\u201d/nIf you\u2019re willing to risk buying directly from a stranger, Step 1 is to make sure the ticket you\u2019re buying is a valid Ticketmaster digital ticket, which is the only type of ticket that will grant you entry into SoFi. Ticketmaster\u2019s website, however, offers no help on this front; it says flatly, \u201cWe can\u2019t verify tickets bought from a third party.\u201d/nWhat you can do is make sure the seller is offering you a ticket directly from a Ticketmaster account. That\u2019s where all legitimate tickets reside, even the ones bought from resellers. /nSadly, many scammers know that too, and either offer a legitimate ticket that they don\u2019t deliver or show a bogus Ticketmaster account page with a fake ticket or a screenshot of a real ticket./nHere\u2019s an example from the Better Business Bureau\u2019s scam tracking site, which is filled with stories from people who paid for Taylor Swift tickets but never received them. A person reported seeing an offer of four SoFi tickets for $600 on a Facebook group called \u201cWaitlisted For The Taylor Swift \u2014 The Eras Tour Presale.\u201d /n\u201cI messaged her, and she showed what I thought was verifiable proof, a screen recording, of her Ticketmaster account with her name and the tickets,\u201d the victim wrote. \u201cAfter sending her the money for the tickets she wouldn\u2019t transfer them to me, like she said she would, and also stopped responding to my Facebook messages.\u201d/n Entertainment & Arts /nWhy are concert tickets so expensive and how can I get a cheaper ticket?/nAug. 21, 2023/nSo you\u2019re going to need to turn up your skepticism dial and look out for common scammer techniques, including:/nIf you\u2019re buying a ticket from someone in your community, do the transaction in person so that you can make sure the transfer happens, said Kevin Roundy, senior technical director at Norton. But the usual safety rules for in-person sales apply: pick a well-lit place filled with people, and don\u2019t bring cash./nIf possible, pay with a credit card (not a debit card) because you\u2019ll be able to get a refund if you\u2019re defrauded. That\u2019s not practical when buying from an individual, though, so in those cases, insist on a payment platform that offers \u201cpurchase protection\u201d as an option, such as Venmo, PayPal and Facebook Marketplace, and then be sure the transaction is covered by it./nWhen looking at sellers on Facebook, remember that people will hack a Facebook account and use it specifically for the purpose of ripping off Swifties, Roundy said. He added, \u201cIf you\u2019re a hacker and you wanted to monetize a hacked Facebook account right now, I couldn\u2019t think of a better way.\u201d/nAnother tip from PIRG: When buying a ticket, check the section and seat number on it to make sure it actually exists. /nRemember, you can\u2019t buy a printed ticket for Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. All transfers have to be done through Ticketmaster\u2019s app or website. So if someone offers to sell you a paper ticket, walk away./n Entertainment & Arts /nPlenty of parking spots are still available for Swift\u2019s shows, but not in the lots on the stadium grounds. For those, you\u2019ll have to go through a reseller and pay even more./nJuly 28, 2023/nFinally, announcing on social media that you\u2019re looking for tickets will make you a magnet for scammers. /nLongtime Taylor Swift fan Krista Smith illustrates this point, and a few other pitfalls faced her fellow Swifties. A native of Vancouver, Smith figured that while she was in Southern California for summer vacation, she might try to get last-minute tickets to the Eras Tour at SoFi. She watched ticket prices drop during the opening acts of Swift\u2019s first concert here Thursday, sinking under her budget of $300. So she and a friend made plans Friday to head to the stadium, starting by posting in a few Swiftie Facebook groups that she was looking for day-of tickets./n\u201cThe first three people that messaged me were very obvious scammers,\u201d Smith, 28, said. She said all three sent similar messages, all mentioning that they were desperate to get rid of their tickets \u2014 the first red flag./n\u201cAt this rate, no one is desperate,\u201d she said. Other \u201csketchy\u201d signs included asking for payments over PayPal as \u201cfriends and family,\u201d instead of through the goods and services feature, which provides purchase protection./nShe was still hopeful they could snag tickets through an online, verified resale vendor, such as Vivid Seats or Stubhub, but even as the opening acts continued, prices didn\u2019t fall \u2014 and seats were going fast./n\u201cWe would refresh pretty often, and as we were putting tickets in our cart, they\u2019re selling,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all dressed up, we\u2019re ready to go inside. \u2026 It was desperate.\u201d/nAt that point, Smith secured two tickets for about $1,400 \u2014 \u201cOur budget kind of expanded when we got to the stadium,\u201d she laughed \u2014 but they weren\u2019t downloaded instantly and the seller wasn\u2019t responding. Time kept ticking by. Swift took the stage, and Smith and her friend were still stuck waiting./nVivid Seats eventually refunded  them for the tickets, and the friends listened outside for a while, traded some friendship bracelets and bought some merch. /n\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d said Smith, who has seen multiple Swift shows on previous tours before her sojourn in L.A. \u201cI\u2019ll watch the livestreams and get my fix that way.\u201d/nTimes staff writer Emma Fox contributed to this report./nAbout The Times Utility Journalism Team/nThis article is from The Times\u2019 Utility Journalism Team.

It\u2019s not cheap, though, as some spots will run you hundreds of dollars. Reselling sites like StubHub and Vivid Seats also have parking accommodations available./nIf you want to save some money, the city of Inglewood also offers a Park & Go service. Spots in the remote lots got for $38.25 each, while round trip rides on the shuttle from the lot to SoFi Stadium are $8.70 per person./nAlso worth noting is that the Kia Forum is right near SoFi Stadium, and they\u2019re selling parking for the Swift concerts, too. Beyond that, you could also just take an Uber, Lyft, taxi, or something like that to the stadium./nThe LA Times piece has additional information about parking and traffic, so learn more here."

Stand with hotel workers and postpone your concerts.\u201d/nFor related news, see: Politicians urge Taylor Swift to postpone LA concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers/nHow, exactly, this would help the cause of hotel workers is a mystery. But it would certainly punish music fans looking for entertainment. This is understood by at least one Democrat, Sen. Josh Becker, who tweeted, \u201cThis seems like a bad idea to me. So many people have bought tickets, some overpaying on the resale market. Clearly we can find other ways to support the strikers that don\u2019t dash the dreams of young fans who have been so looking forward to this concert.\u201d/nAlas, considering the union and politics involved, reason is too much to ask for./nFor related news, see: Taylor Swift should ignore the hollow hysterics of Unite Here Local 11 and continue shows as normal/nThe union, Unite Here Local 11, has been known throughout Southern California for trying to force hotel establishments into unionization. One of its leaders is Ada Briceno, who happens to also be a leader of the Orange County Democratic Party./nClearly, Kounalakis is trying to gain favor with the union and virtue signal to other unions since she is now also running for governor of California. As far as we can tell, Kounalakis\u2019 most notable interaction with unions traces back to her 2019 arrangement of having unions help pony up hundreds of thousands of dollars to refurbish her office./nNow, she is illogically calling on Taylor Swift to punish her fans to somehow show support for union activists. In a wonderful demonstration of hypocrisy, Kounalakis joins this call despite having just attended a Taylor Swift show herself, according to Politico./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nThis editorial board regrets this poorly thought out political stunt from Kounalakis and notes her hypocritical approach to politics. California needs better leadership and it\u2019s not going to get it from politicians like Kounalakis who throw logic out the window to appease hysterical unions."

    "content": "Taylormania has come to the multiplex./nTwo months after she completed the first leg of her globe-conquering Eras tour, Taylor Swift presided over the premiere of her new concert movie, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\u201d on Wednesday night at the high-end Grove shopping mall in Los Angeles./nThe film, directed by Sam Wrench and shot in August during the 33-year-old pop superstar\u2019s sold-out six-night stand at Inglewood\u2019s SoFi Stadium, arrives at a characteristically busy moment for Swift, who\u2019s got a new album due later this month in the form of \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and who\u2019s been traveling the country to watch her NFL player of a rumored boyfriend, Travis Kelce, do his thing on the field./nAnd yet to hear Swift tell it, she\u2019s practically counting down the days till she gets back on the road for another round of shows./n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a fraction of the amount of fun I had on the Eras tour,\u201d she told an audience at the Grove peppered with friends and fellow celebs. Times pop music critic Mikael Wood and Times film critic Justin Chang were in the house as well and compared notes afterward./nMIKAEL WOOD: Well, Justin, allow me to start by quoting Taylor Swift: \u201cWelcome to the Eras tour!\u201d Having seen Swift\u2019s show three times \u2014 on opening night in Arizona and then twice at SoFi Stadium \u2014 I\u2019m eager to hear how this pop extravaganza played onscreen for someone who hasn\u2019t seen it in the flesh. Was its length exhausting to you? Did its nonchronological run through Swift\u2019s catalog tell a discernible story? Could you grasp why she placed a fedora on a cute kid\u2019s head at one point?/nFor our readers, I\u2019ll say that \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d movie is a pretty straightforward depiction of the production Swift took to stadiums across the country this year; there\u2019s no backstage footage, no documentary dressing, no talking-head voice-overs to explain what we\u2019re witnessing. (There is a cute blooper reel at the end.) A few songs have been cut from the set list \u2014 among them, tragically, \u201cThe Archer\u201d \u2014 to get the film\u2019s run time under three hours, slightly. But if you\u2019ve seen the Eras tour, you\u2019ll recognize \u201cThe Eras Tour.\u201d/nNow, a big part of the show in real life is the sceney-ness of it all: the fans in wild and creative outfits, the swapping of friendship bracelets, the many famous people who\u2019ve turned up in various cities to watch Swift perform. And that  was the case too at the Grove, where decked-out Swifties milled around excitedly in the lobby before showtime, trading stories about how many tour dates they\u2019d attended. For last night\u2019s world premiere, something like 2,000 guests filled more than a dozen of the AMC building\u2019s theaters; I was in the one where Swift herself took in the movie, surrounded by the backing vocalists from her road band and an assortment of celebrities including Adam Sandler, Maren Morris, Julia Garner, Simu Liu and former rich-guy L.A. mayoral candidate (and Grove mega-developer) Rick Caruso./nI have to admit I spent a fair amount of time watching the singer watch herself, and I can definitively say that Taylor Swift is all in on Taylor Swift. (Also: Sandler? Big \u201cReputation\u201d guy.) But enough about the vibe. What did you make of \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d as, y\u2019know, a movie?/nJUSTIN CHANG: I\u2019ll answer that in a second, Mikael, right after I\u2019ve cleared my head and shaken off the last vestiges of \u201cShake It Off\u201d (a favorite of my 7-year-old daughter\u2019s and thus a perennial household earworm). In all seriousness, Wednesday night\u2019s premiere was a wonderfully deranged experience. It was exhaustingly long, at 168 minutes, yes, though given the show\u2019s three-hour-plus run time, you have to admire the movie\u2019s economy. Still, it didn\u2019t help that our AMC theater had to stop and restart the movie 15 minutes in due to a distracting sound-sync issue. I\u2019m glad they fixed it; for a while I feared that audio and video were never, ever, ever / getting back together./nAnyway, how\u2019s the movie? This Taylor Swift nonexpert could hardly be less qualified to answer. At the same time, I have to imagine my reaction was not entirely dissimilar to that of anyone \u2014 even a die-hard Swiftie \u2014 encountering the show for the first time. Again and again, in between private stretches of partial tune recognition, my jaw dropped at the sheer visual grandeur of the thing: the dramatic shifts in setting and scale that can find Swift crooning gentle songs from \u201cEvermore\u201d at a fantastical moss-covered piano one minute and then diving into some kind of digitally confected pond the next./nMost of all, I gaped at Swift\u2019s sheer physical and musical stamina, by which I mean not just the unflagging energy and sustained quality of her vocals, but also the staggering post-2018 artistic output that \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d encompasses. The COVID years were extraordinarily productive, transformative years for Swift, and both the show and now the movie tell the story of that transformation. And just as the tour, with its Ticketmaster-smashing success, has rejuvenated the music industry like nothing since before the pandemic, so the film looks poised to set the box office ablaze; it\u2019s the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d of pop-music juggernauts./nI\u2019m curious, Mikael, having seen the Eras tour three times already, how was your fourth go-round? Did you, like me, enjoy the way the movie collapsed live and theatrical viewing experiences, the way all the dancing, light-waving people in our theater seemed to merge with all the dancing, light-waving people at SoFi Stadium? Those crucial missing songs aside, were there aspects of the movie that you feel diminished, or perhaps improved upon, the original?/nWOOD: I love your point about the merging of Swift\u2019s two audiences because it\u2019s true: Again and again on Wednesday night, I couldn\u2019t tell where the crowd noise in the film ended and where the crowd noise around me began./nAs in the live show, Swift\u2019s song \u201cCruel Summer\u201d \u2014 a No. 3 hit on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 this week, more than four years after it came out \u2014 appears at the very beginning of \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d and in my theater, at least, it had people singing along at full volume from the jump. Very \u201cRocky Horror Picture Show,\u201d especially in the little moments when fans got to demonstrate their deep knowledge of Swift\u2019s work \u2014 the bit in \u201cAll Too Well (10-Minute Version),\u201d for instance, when they screamed \u201cF\u2014 the patriarchy\u201d along with her./nIs this rowdy interactive approach one way that Hollywood might hope to save the theatrical business? If nothing else, it\u2019s sure to be a part of the Beyonc\u00e9 concert film that will follow Taylor\u2019s into theaters in December. I wonder how that prospect strikes a committed moviegoer like you, Justin. (Stray thought: The Grove was serving booze at the premiere, which no doubt helped loosen up some number of Swifties. How might \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d shape theater owners\u2019 feelings on liquor at the multiplex?)/nYou asked whether the cinematic experience improved upon the real-life experience in any way. The answer is yes, and it came in the close-ups: You get to see the intricacies of the choreography in a song like \u201cThe Man,\u201d where Swift and one of her dancers lay out a scene of casual boardroom sexism; you get to see the instrumental interplay between the singer and her band, as in a hoedown-ish take on \u201cFearless.\u201d/nAnd you get to behold Swift\u2019s acting: the way she flares her eyes at a certain point in \u201cChampagne Problems\u201d or her portrayal of a neglected partner in \u201cTolerate It,\u201d which depicts an unraveling marriage with a level of detail I didn\u2019t catch in any of the concerts I saw in person. Speaking purely in terms of her dramatic abilities, I don\u2019t think Swift\u2019s on a level with former Disney kid Olivia Rodrigo, to name one of her many musical inheritors. But there\u2019s no doubting that those skills are what help hold together the vast tonal and stylistic range of her music. What did you make, Justin, of Taylor Swift, screen thespian?/nCHANG: \u201cChampagne Problems\u201d and \u201cTolerate It\u201d are indeed melancholy highlights, and the raw anguish of the latter\u2019s elaborate \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d homage surely registers more powerfully up close, I imagine, than it does from a distance. Here and elsewhere, Swift\u2019s ability to project intimacy becomes the movie\u2019s reason for being: You get the delirious sensation of being swallowed up by a massive crowd, up to a point, but then, in the space of a single cut, it\u2019s suddenly just her alone onstage, all but bringing the performance directly to you. I felt that way watching her perform \u201cYou\u2019re On Your Own, Kid,\u201d a song that compacts so much painful history, but which Swift suffuses with a lightness and energy that feels bracingly optimistic./nThose moments aside, Mikael, what struck me most about Swift\u2019s performance was her apparently unfeigned delight, her seemingly genuine pleasure at being there onstage in front of a gargantuan crowd, doing the most draining, all-consuming work of her career night after epic night. Early in the show she points her finger into the crowd and moves it around the entire stadium, conjuring an aural wave that you can practically feel traveling around the movie theater, before it finally surges in a seat-rattling surround-sound crescendo. The pleasure of the moment lies in how utterly tickled Swift seems by her own power, which can hardly be a surprise to her at this point. Somehow, she convinces you that it is./nAs the opposite of a committed concertgoer, I don\u2019t mean to sound naive or to assume that this sort of effervescence is unique to Swift. Over the years, of course, her many critics have dismissed her as calculated and inauthentic \u2014 accusations that are par for the course, I think, for a female artist who gets anywhere near her stratospheric level of success. But authenticity has always been a tricky, even dubious concept in art, and one of the pleasures of \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d is the way it destroys the facile notion of a pure individual self. With its labyrinthine arc, jumbled chronology and dazzling changes of tone, milieu and costume, it\u2019s Swift\u2019s ode to invention and self-reinvention, the many different lives she\u2019s lived and faces she\u2019s presented over the course of her career./nOur audience certainly seemed to lap it up unreservedly, full of liquor and high on their own Taylormania. I can only imagine how that must have been with Swift herself sitting there in your theater, Mikael; I imagine watching Taylor Swift watch Taylor Swift must have been its own uniquely mesmerizing experience, to the point where sometimes even the big screen itself became an afterthought. Then again, as you noted, \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d is doing its damnedest to give movie theaters a badly needed shot of adrenaline. With a $100 million-plus opening weekend in the offing, it\u2019s going to be a huge boon for multiplexes nationwide./nThere may be something a little depressing about that from a lowly film critic\u2019s standpoint, insofar as it suggests that theaters can thrive only when a movie becomes a gargantuan cinematic event \u2014 an occasion to dress up, plan a friends\u2019 night out and bask in an experience you can\u2019t get in your living room. It entrenches the idea of moviegoing as an exception, a rarity. But with any luck, the same folks flooding theaters for \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d will remember how much fun it can be; hell, maybe they\u2019ll feel like sticking around and checking out \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d while they\u2019re at it.

Getting the networks to run a free promo is not unheard of and not necessarily that big a deal (the NFL probably makes the point that Taylor is drawing new attention from female fans and that is good for everyone). I disagree with others who pooh pooh her impact; I think Taylor does make a ratings difference.\u201d/nSwift has attended the last two Chiefs games while supporting her beau Kelce, the first one in Kansas City where he scored a touchdown in a 41-10 blowout of the Bears, and the second in Sunday night\u2019s 23-20 win over the Jets at Met Life Stadium./nThe romance between the world\u2019s biggest pop star and the NFL\u2019s best tight end has been the story of the league this season \u2014 and possibly the biggest story in sports./nHer attendance at the games has also driven interest in the NFL./nKANSAS CITY, MISSOURI - SEPTEMBER 24: Taylor Swift watches a regular season game between the Kansas ...

Videos showed Ms. Swift throwing a water bottle to one fan and instructing stadium staff to get water to others as people in the crowd chanted for water./nThe tragedy paired two of the year\u2019s major story lines: rising temperatures and the hysteria for Ms. Swift\u2019s global tour./nIn Argentina, where Ms. Swift played last week, some fans camped out for more than five months to try to get a spot closer to the stage. In Brazil, a day after Ms. Benevides\u2019s death, fans lined up early for entry to Saturday\u2019s show even as temperatures continued to soar. It is the second show Ms. Swift has had to postpone because of extreme weather in the past week \u2014 her Nov. 10 show in Buenos Aires was moved to Nov. 12./nIn an online post, Ms. Swift said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d by her fan\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to speak about this from stage because I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it,\u201d she said./nWadih Damous, the head of Brazil\u2019s consumer protection agency, said his agency had ordered the concert\u2019s organizers to provide free water at various locations at Ms. Swift\u2019s shows on Saturday and Sunday./n\u201cThe decision to prevent thousands of people from drinking water in 60-degree Celsius heat is insane and irresponsible,\u201d Mr. Damous said. He said the government would investigate Time for Fun./nThe company said on Saturday that it would add staff, provide free water and allow fans to enter the stadium with water and food./nBy the time Saturday\u2019s show was canceled, thousands of fans had shown up at the stadium in Rio anyway, and as the crowds left the area, unrest linked to gang activity erupted, a representative for the military police said on Saturday night./nVideo footage on social media showed panicked fans running and officers with guns nearby. Another video published online by a local news outlet showed some people hunkering down near the cash register of a Burger King restaurant. The crowd is \u201ccompletely psychologically unstable,\u201d the police spokesman said, but stressed that no injuries, arrests or robberies had been reported so far./nParts of Brazil have been suffering under a sweltering heat wave this week, with temperatures breaking records and the national meteorological institute issuing safety alerts to 15 states. In Rio, temperatures surpassed 106 degrees Fahrenheit, or 41 degrees Celsius, on Friday. The heat index, a measure of how hot the air feels because of humidity, hit 139 degrees Fahrenheit, a record for the city./nIt appears almost certain that 2023 will be Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, with global temperatures hitting record highs in each of the past five months, from June through October. Scientists have said that the year\u2019s record heat has been driven by the continued emissions of heat-trapping gases, mostly from the burning of oil, gas and coal, as well as the return of El Ni\u00f1o, a cyclical weather pattern./nBrazilian government institutions have said that since June, El Ni\u00f1o has changed the region\u2019s weather patterns, increasing temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near South America by three degrees Celsius, while bringing more rain to the south and droughts to the north./nFelipe Galv\u00e3o, 28, a systems analyst, was on the field level near the stage on Friday when people started getting sick from the heat even before the concert started. By the time the show began, so many people had gotten sick and left their places that he was able to reach the railing along the stage./n\u201cI\u2019ve been going to concerts since 2011, but I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was little staff and unfortunately they couldn\u2019t do much for the fans.

However, Q3 showed the largest growth with a 15.1% year-on-year increase. A total of 3,952,262 vinyl LPs were sold between January and the end of September of this year./nA handful of incredibly popular acts are at the forefront of this increase in vinyl sales. Lana Del Rey, Blur, and Taylor Swift are leading the charge so far./n[RELATED: Lana Del Rey Praises Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish: \u201cI Love Them and Their Music\u201d]/nUnsurprisingly, Swift\u2019s Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) moved the most units in Q3.

And you don\u2019t have to be a whiz at sound engineering, lighting or other technical field to join them \u2014 you just have to be 18 or older./nGig work apps have become more popular in recent years for filling temporary jobs in roles such as bartender, cashier and concessions, dishwasher, prep cook and event staff. /nThe good news for ticketless Swifties is that the hospitality staffing app Tend just released its Eras jobs list, and it\u2019s looking for candidates. /n Entertainment & Arts /nParking!

You should be approved within a few minutes to see open jobs. /nDecide whether you want to be part of the parking or wristband crew./nCurrently, there are two categories of jobs listed by Nowsta Talent, the staffing agency, for the Eras Tour: parking attendant and wristband crew. More types of positions may open up for the  L.A. concert dates. /nFor each concert date from Aug. 3 to 9, there are roughly 80 to 110 people needed for wristband crew to hand out LED bracelets that light up in sync with Swift\u2019s performance. Read carefully before clicking apply, as only some wristband crew members will work during concert hours./nThe job pays $18.50 to $20.50 an hour, depending on your shift time. Transportation is not provided, so you\u2019ll have to find your way to Inglewood on your own. And bring only a minimal number of items in a clear bag, as the agency does not have any space to store your personal belongings. /nApproximately 25 LAZ parking attendants per day will work from 1 p.m. to midnight  at lots that, judging from LAZ\u2019s website, aren\u2019t on the SoFi grounds. This job pays $18.25 an hour. You won\u2019t be able to see the show, but you may have a chance to hear Swift sing (SoFi is an open-air stadium)./nAce the interview./nAfter submitting an application, wait for an interview. /nDemand is high, so you may not get a response if your profile does not match what employers are looking for. According to a Washington Post article, Taylor Swift tour jobs have received triple the usual amount of applications for concerts. Volunteer groups such as California Triathlon are also partnering with SoFi to staff concessions, so there are fewer slots now for gig workers. /nUnfortunately, you won\u2019t get to wear your Eras Tour planned outfits because the attire will be all-black.

But also enjoy the ambiance as a Swiftie./nDon\u2019t suddenly \u201crun off to the bathroom\u201d to sneak into the show and avoid your responsibilities. Many Swifties will be depending on you for a smooth concert experience. You\u2019ll also be permanently banned from Tend if you abandon your post. /nOn the other hand, feel free to lip-sync along with the songs and enjoy the concert atmosphere.

In fact, that\u2019s the kind of thing she probably gives out big cash bonuses for. But a security guard did get fired for his conduct at the Eras Tour\u2014not so much for the singing along but for the viral video of him doing it./nThe security guard in question is one Calvin Denker, who has said he only applied for the gig so that he could attend the tour without paying for tickets (via NBC News). The problem with that plan was that security isn\u2019t there to watch the concert, and his employer, BEST Crowd Management, has\u00a0strict rules about security taking photos of the show. \u201cAfter night one, I was realizing how close Taylor Swift was getting to me, so I really wanted to get a photo to document it,\u201d Denker said in a TikTok video. \u201cSo I handed down these little pieces of paper that said I wasn\u2019t allowed to have my phone out, but if Taylor Swift comes right behind me, please take a photo of me and text it to my number. And I handed this out to a couple of people in the front row for night two and they were really kind and really sweet about it.\u201d/n@calvindenker My security job for Taylor Swift #theerastour #taylorswift #minneapoliserastour #greenscreen \u266c original sound - Calvin Denker/nIt\u2019s a pretty clever ploy, you have to admit, and Denker ended up going viral for singing along to Swift\u2019s track \u201cCruel Summer\u201d with his back to the stage. \u201cEvery photo of me from that night was from behind the barricade like any other photo from a fan would be. I never took my own phone out,\u201d he maintained in a follow-up TikTok. \u201cAnd above all else, I made sure that Taylor Swift was safe and all the fans had a good time. As long as I was at that concert, I was doing my job.\u201d/nUnfortunately, getting other people to take photos of him did not end up being the loophole Denker thought it was. \u201cLong story short: I was fired for it,\u201d he said in his TikTok, noting that \u201cthe main issue they had was with my follow-up video where I said I handed out pieces of paper to the people in front of me to ask to be sent any photos that I made my way into.\u201d He added, \u201cBeyond that, the HR woman who called me wasn\u2019t able to articulate exactly what I did wrong, because I didn\u2019t do anything beyond asking for photos, which is what happens at any other concert, with the only exception being that I made sure I got any that I was included in.\u201d/nThere was apparently some confusion over whether this really was a fireable offense\u2014Denker offered to take down his video, and he was scheduled for more shifts before the company ultimately gave him the boot. But \u201cPlease don\u2019t go sending any hate to this company,\u201d he said in his video. \u201cI just wanted to update all of you because it was a very popular TikTok for me, so I wanted to let all of you know what had happened. I still got to work one of the coolest concerts ever, and I got to work it twice, so that is fantastic, and I hold no grudges against my employer.\u201d If video evidence of singing along to \u201cCruel Summer\u201d is wrong, then this writer doesn\u2019t want to be right."

For people who couldn\u2019t spend a chunk of cash on tickets, this was the next best thing: enjoying her music outside the venue\u2019s walls, a practice that\u2019s come to be known as Tayl-gating./nAhead of the Eras tour show at SoFi Stadium, however, the city of Inglewood\u2019s message is Tayl-gating \u201cwouldn\u2019t be effective here.\u201d/nMayor James T. Butts Jr. said SoFi Stadium is a quarter-mile away from the sidewalk area that rings the property. The closest is on Prairie Avenue, and \u201cthe sidewalk of Prairie is not wide enough\u201d for people to gather. /nThe city already doesn\u2019t allow people to block sidewalks, citing public safety concerns. If Swifties set up shop there, he said, they would be asked to move along./nAnd the chances of hearing Swift from Prairie Avenue would be slim.

But hanging out there without a ticket will be, shall we say, strongly discouraged./nAs part of the guidance it\u2019s offering attendees, SoFi reminds concert-goers that they\u2019ll need a ticket to enter the stadium property./n Entertainment & Arts /nWant to make an entire week out of Taylor Swift events?

The rise of the concert film genre is said to have started with Concert Magic, released in 1948, which featured violinist Yehudi Menuhin performing with various artists at the Charlie Chaplin Studios the year before. The genre expanded with T.A.M.I. Show, a 1964 movie about a Santa Monica Civic Auditorium concert that featured Chuck Berry, Marvin Gaye, James Brown, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones, and 1964 movie Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii in 1972. Pop stars brought the genre to a young millennial audience with Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert in 2008 and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never in 2011. The later pop star was just 16 when the 3-D film\u2014produced by Bieber and his manager Scooter Braun\u2014was released at the height of the Belieber era, and it remains the highest-grossing concert film to date. Katy Perry, the Jonas Brothers, U2, Neil Young and the Glee cast all released concert movies between 2006 and 2012.

    "content": "The NFL has been touting for years that more women have been watching the sport, with the share of female football fans now near 50 percent./nThat seems to have happened despite the league's efforts at courting women. From the ill-advised Pepto-pink jerseys that once permeated the NFL's online shop (seriously, why did it take so long to offer team-colored jerseys in a more flattering cut?), to a special page for women on the league website a little over a decade ago that promoted \"homegating\" with recipes, to the reported laughably small amount of money it actually donated to breast cancer-related charities during its once-vaunted and now-abandoned Pink October efforts, the NFL's attempts have been shallow at best, focused on stereotypes about women./nGiven what we've seen in recent weeks, it feels like little has changed in the NFL's approach, except the methods of pandering. Now the league can use social media channels like TikTok and Instagram, which have high percentages of younger female users./nAnd use them it will./nNow that Taylor Swift, one of the most recognizable women in the country, is involved with one of the league's biggest stars in Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce, the NFL and its broadcast partners are going overboard in trying to court Swifties, the singer's rabid fan base./nIn a lot of ways, it is thirsty and, well, shallow, though unsurprising. This is, after all, a sports organization that would put the opening of an empty paper bag in prime time on its in-house network if it could sell the ad time./nDon't take just my word for it either. Kelce and his big brother Jason also said the NFL is doing too much, saying so on the latest episode of their weekly podcast \"New Heights.\"/nOn Sunday night, with Swift in attendance for her second straight Chiefs game, this the team's prime time matchup against the New York Jets, NBC showed Swift 17 times during the broadcast of the game, the Los Angeles Times reported. Seventeen times!/nOn Monday, the league's official feed on X, formerly known as Twitter, changed its header to three photos of Swift reacting to moments from Chiefs-Jets and switched its bio to a lyric from Swift's \"The Best Day.\"/nThere are seven clips on the league TikTok feed that feature Swift, including a pinned one of she and Kelce holding hands after Kansas City's home win over the Chicago Bears in Week 3, the first game the Grammy winner attended. There are at least five photos or videos of Swift on the NFL's Instagram page./nBy Wednesday, with the fatigue mounting and criticism coming from the Kelce brothers, the NFL defended its over-the-top Tay-tention in a statement to People magazine./n\"We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what\u2019s happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,\" the statement said. \"The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we\u2019ve leaned into in real time, as it\u2019s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we\u2019ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.\"/nExcept this isn't really a \"pop cultural moment\" the NFL should be exploiting for its own gain. A pregnant Rihanna floating over the field at State Farm Stadium during the Super Bowl LVII halftime show earlier this year is a cultural moment. Beyonc\u00e9 reuniting Destiny's Child for her Super Bowl XLII halftime show was a cultural moment. This is two people who might be just beginning a relationship. Yes, she's famous and increasingly he is too, joking with his brother on \"The Heights\" about the number of commercials he shot during the offseason that are now debuting during NFL games./nThe NFL, however, seems committed to squeezing everything it can out of this, capitalizing off of Swift's presence as she shows support for Kelce, seeing nothing but an opportunity to seize for its own gain and potentially grow its audience among younger women. The result of this force-feeding was 27 million in viewership, according to NBC, the most for a Sunday night game since the last Super Bowl. Much of that spike was a result of increased viewership from young women./nBut if this Swift-Kelce spectacle hadn\u2019t occurred, what would the league be doing to court younger women?/nOne of these days the NFL might figure out how to get and keep women's attention without advice on how to throw the best \"homegating\" party or using a woman's budding relationship for social media fodder. That day isn't here yet."

Which Travis realizes comes with the territory. \u201cLook, I brought all this attention to me [sic],\u201d the told brother Jason Kelce during a podcast episode. \u201cI did the whole friendship bracelet thing and told everyone how butthurt [I was] that I couldn\u2019t meet her \u2014 You miss 100 percent of the shots you don\u2019t take!\u201d/n\u00a0/n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaylor Swift's Eras Tour Concert Looks: See All Of Her Best Outfit Photos\t\t\t\t\n"

Over the weekend, the global superstar was spotted in a football stadium, cheering on the Kansas City Chiefs, specifically cheering on the tight end of the Chiefs, Travis Kelce. Swift's appearance at Sunday's game and the fact that she and Kelce left the stadium together blew up the internet. It seemed like everybody had something to say about the new it couple, even legendary Patriots coach Bill Belichick.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL BELICHICK: Travis Kelce has had a lot of big catches in his career.(LAUGHTER)BELICHICK: This would be the biggest.CHANG: As for Swifties, well, they seem to have embraced their queen's new boo. Sales for Kelce's football jersey reportedly skyrocketed since Sunday. And here to talk about this meeting of two super-fandoms is Nora Pinciotti, staff writer for The Ringer and major Swiftie herself. Hello.NORA PRINCIOTTI: Hello. Hello.CHANG: OK, Nora, for listeners who may not be following all the ins and outs of Taylor Swift's dating life, give us a brief timeline of the rumored Swift-Kelce love story. How did this all start?PRINCIOTTI: So it started in July, when Travis Kelsey went to one of Taylor's Eras Tour shows when she was in Kansas City. And he did something that a lot of Swift fans have done at the Eras Tour, which is that he made and wore and brought a friendship bracelet. And he did a funny thing, which is that he put his phone number...CHANG: Oh, nice move.PRINCIOTTI: ...On a friendship bracelet. I know - very savvy. And he tried to get it to Taylor but was unsuccessful. Then he told the story of not getting through the inner circle on his podcast with his brother, who's another NFL player. And then the rumors start. But that was what seeded some form of communication between the two of them that ended in Taylor accepting Travis' invitation to show up at Arrowhead Stadium to see the Chiefs play the Bears on Sunday.CHANG: In perfect Chiefs colors. OK, well, Swifties are famously passionate about the pop star. Football fans are also famously passionate about their teams. Can you just compare these two fandoms for me? Like, is knowing your favorite NFL player's stats kind of like being able to identify all the little Easter eggs that Taylor is known to hide in her songs?PRINCIOTTI: It sort of is for two groups that I think in some ways don't identify as having very much in common with each other. There is an enthusiasm and a detail orientation and an obsessive quality that definitely...CHANG: I love it. They're colliding now.PRINCIOTTI: Yeah, it's really great. There's a couple key differences, though. One is that NFL players, for the scope of the NFL writ large - you know, it's the biggest American professional sport - the players themselves can be relatively anonymous when they play. You can't really see their faces. There's 53 guys on every roster. It's not the same type of superstardom that you find even in other sports and definitely not in pop music.CHANG: I want to know. What about the NFL in all of this? - because as we mentioned, sales for Travis Kelce's jersey have apparently skyrocketed. And that could very well be because of Taylor's fans. And I saw that many of the post-game questions were about Taylor Swift's appearance at the game. The commentators were all talking about it. Is Taylor Swift going to be awesome or terrible for the NFL and the future of football? What do you think?PRINCIOTTI: Well, I suppose that remains to be seen. I do think in general, the NFL is incredibly excited about getting a piece of the Taylor spotlight. You could already tell over the summer because the Eras Tour concerts - they were all in NFL stadiums. And the football team that played in whatever stadium she was visiting - their social media account, their whole operation would bend over backwards to come up with something that, you know, allowed them to sort of connect with the Taylor Swift fan base. So the NFL, which does want to improve its exposure and appeal to women especially, I think is thrilled about this.CHANG: That is Nora Princiotti, staff writer for The Ringer and host of Every Single Album, a pop music podcast.
