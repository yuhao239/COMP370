16,could taylor swifts megatour have fans seeing red on their next covid testnthere has been some cautious optimism among public health officials that this summer might be the first during which california doesnt experience a major coronavirus wave  and theres no evidence at this point that one is on the way nbut california is not in the clear or out of the woods just yet transmission does appear to be on the upswing and theres no denying the virus enduring power to spread particularly in crowded settings and crowded hardly begins to describe swifts concerts let alone the fan mania that has surrounded them ngiven the relatively low rate of covid community transmission and the ability of everyone to take sensible precautions we are hopeful the concerts will not significantly impact community transmission rates the los angeles county department of public health said in a statement to the timesn music ntaylor swift kicked off six soldout shows at sofi stadium and the times mikael wood and suzy exposito were there to provide a full rundownnaug  nthere have been a handful of reports of coronavirus infections after swifts concerts at the outdoor levis stadium in santa clara and elsewhere in recent weeks but its unclear whether those played any more significant a role in terms of spread than other social gatherings or large events such as the recent san diego comicconnthe la county department of public health said it has not heard of other areas that have reported a notable increase in coronavirus transmission linked to swifts previous stops her tour began in march and continued amid a national downturn in covid hospitalizations  which hit a record low in late june before ticking back upwardnbut at this point with coronavirus case reporting uneven and largely unreliable it would be difficult if not impossible to definitively say whether a specific event like the swift concerts was a major factor behind an uptick in local transmission according to the santa clara county department of public health nin general though coronavirus levels in wastewater have already been increasing in both santa clara county  northern californias most populous  and la county even before swifts arrival reports of covid hospitalizations and emergency department visits have also started to climb slightly in la county n science  medicine ntest positivity has ticked up in la county in recent weeks though were still well below peak covid levels if you get covid now heres how to treat it how long to isolate how to get paxlovid and more information on getting healthynjuly  nwith covid once more on the rise experts say that concert attendees should not be completely surprised if they do fall ill afterwardnpeople have to be aware that its a potential venue for infection and riskier than most venues given all the shouting the singing the fact that its three hours  even though its outdoors said dr peter chinhong a uc san francisco infectiousdisease expert youre just bringing people together from lots of different places  people are traveling all over the country to the city where they can get tickets so its like a mega airport or a mega transportation site if you think about it nbeing at a concert in a stadium environment even outdoors could potentially carry a higher risk of infection than being inside a supermarket or an airport because at a concert theres a lot of shouting and screaming he addednla county health officials said coronavirus transmission is possible during swifts sixday slate of local concerts the first of which was thursday but they noted that fortunately sofi stadiums indooroutdoor design can increase air circulation in most parts of the stadium which we know helps reduce transmission nthere is a fixed roof at the inglewood venue but its edges are open to the outdoors letting in ocean breezesn science  medicine nits  and you just tested positive for covid now what the latest cdc protocols isolation recommendations ways to treat it and ways to prevent long covidnmarch  nto be clear the covid landscape this summer is generally far less dangerous than previously in the pandemic with most people having a degree of immunity  from vaccinations previous infection or a combination of the two theres also wide availability of anticovid drugs such as paxlovid nstill it would be a mistake to be completely fearless of the disease covid remains deadly to some elderly individuals continue to be at higher risk especially if they are not uptodate on their shots there also still is some risk of contracting long covid any time a person is infected nchinhong said he is not suggesting anyone cancel their concert plans and noted that swift has been super responsible during the pandemic in early  as the deadliest covid surge hit the nation swift canceled a planned concert tour and said she cant wait til we can all safely be at shows together againnstill chinhong said its important to be aware that covid spread remains a possibility and while masks may have largely gone  out of style they can still play a helpful role even if used sparingly nfirst of all if youre at high risk you still could go  its still outdoors  but you might want to mask if youre immunecompromised chinhong said and for those who arent going to mask in the stands some ways to reduce risk would be to wear a mask in more cramped spaces like when visiting concession stands going to the restroom or while aboard public transit n california ncalifornia politicians have asked taylor swift to cancel her la tour dates this week in solidarity with striking hotel workers its an impossible ask but one the singer cant ignorenaug  nand if you do fall ill two or three days after the concert you should test a lot of people are not testing anymore but testing is important so you can protect people by staying home and not spreading the infection to others chinhong said health officials say people who have covid need to stay home for at least five days after their first symptoms or their first positive test result whichever came first nmost health plans are required under california law to reimburse insured patients for eight athome covid tests per month per covered person nin addition higherrisk people with covid should speak to their healthcare provider about getting prescribed an anticovid drug such as paxlovid which reduces the risk of severe illness and death and may lower the risk of developing long covid paxlovid is provided to patients for free npaxlovid is often prescribed for people  and older but it can also be prescribed to people who are younger and have no major medical problemsn california nnew study suggests that people with a specific version of a particular gene who got covid were far more likely to experience an asymptomatic infectionnjuly  nevery county in california is reporting a low covid hospital admission rate according to the us centers for disease control and prevention based on that level the la county department of public health says that for the general public masking is up to a persons individual preference but the agency still recommends masking in places such as public transit and transportation hubs ncovid hospitalizations nationwide are among their lowest levels since the pandemic began but have started to tick upward nationally there were  new covid hospitalizations for the week that ended july  up  from the prior week in california the comparable number is  also up  from the prior week ncalifornians who dont have insurance or are having a hard

472,when it comes to buying lastminute tickets to see taylor swift at sofi stadium dont be the foolish onensometimes there are great deals to be had for buyers in the right place at the right time but there are far more scammers looking for overeager fans than legitimate sellers willing to unload tickets at below the going ratenif money is no object you can find tickets for any of the remaining soldout shows in inglewood through legitimate ticket brokers and resellers online like stubhub vivid seats and seatgeek these platforms offer moneyback guarantees if your ticket turns out to not be valid stubhub even pledges to try to get you in the door anyway and into a real seat on monday for example the leastexpensive ones at stubhubcom were  and that was for seats in the upper deck or behind the stagenand resale prices may come down more if history is any guide the new york post reported that ticket reseller vivid seats saw prices for eras tour tickets in five other cities drop  at the last minute  although thats  off the considerably higher resale price not the original nnevertheless hope springs eternal for ticketless swifties which is why youll find plenty of anecdotes online about tickets released at the last minute for sale at or below face value or unloaded on the cheap by a desperate seller and there are some groups out there dedicated to helping swifties obtain tickets at face value or less  see for example erastourresell on the social network formerly known as twitternbefore leaping at an offer that seems to fulfill your wildest dreams however consider the advice from experts on how to avoid being sold a worthless faken entertainment  arts nparking public transit fan chants friendship bracelets everything you need to know before you see taylor swift at sofi stadium for the la stops of her eras tournaug  nthe most common piece of advice dont buy a ticket directly from an individual whom you dont know its far safer to buy from a reseller such as stubhub which offers protection against scammy sellers but that protection comes at a premium pricensimply buying through a thirdparty platform like a facebook group or craigslist isnt enough because the safeguards offered buyers vary from site to site and some like craigslist dont offer any because theyre simply advertising platforms not ticket exchanges worse some scammers create fraudulent resale platforms to pull off their cons nnever trust a link to a site sent via text email or social media not only might the link take you to a webpage loaded with malware it could also send you to an expertly crafted knockoff designed to look just like a wellknown resellers sitenas the us public interest research group notes in its guide to avoiding ticket scams a scammer can for example create a website with the url tlcketmastercom did you notice that url contains a lowercase l and not an i betcha didntnif youre willing to risk buying directly from a stranger step  is to make sure the ticket youre buying is a valid ticketmaster digital ticket which is the only type of ticket that will grant you entry into sofi ticketmasters website however offers no help on this front it says flatly we cant verify tickets bought from a third partynwhat you can do is make sure the seller is offering you a ticket directly from a ticketmaster account thats where all legitimate tickets reside even the ones bought from resellers nsadly many scammers know that too and either offer a legitimate ticket that they dont deliver or show a bogus ticketmaster account page with a fake ticket or a screenshot of a real ticketnheres an example from the better business bureaus scam tracking site which is filled with stories from people who paid for taylor swift tickets but never received them a person reported seeing an offer of four sofi tickets for  on a facebook group called waitlisted for the taylor swift  the eras tour presale ni messaged her and she showed what i thought was verifiable proof a screen recording of her ticketmaster account with her name and the tickets the victim wrote after sending her the money for the tickets she wouldnt transfer them to me like she said she would and also stopped responding to my facebook messagesn entertainment  arts nwhy are concert tickets so expensive and how can i get a cheaper ticketnaug  nso youre going to need to turn up your skepticism dial and look out for common scammer techniques includingnif youre buying a ticket from someone in your community do the transaction in person so that you can make sure the transfer happens said kevin roundy senior technical director at norton but the usual safety rules for inperson sales apply pick a welllit place filled with people and dont bring cashnif possible pay with a credit card not a debit card because youll be able to get a refund if youre defrauded thats not practical when buying from an individual though so in those cases insist on a payment platform that offers purchase protection as an option such as venmo paypal and facebook marketplace and then be sure the transaction is covered by itnwhen looking at sellers on facebook remember that people will hack a facebook account and use it specifically for the purpose of ripping off swifties roundy said he added if youre a hacker and you wanted to monetize a hacked facebook account right now i couldnt think of a better waynanother tip from pirg when buying a ticket check the section and seat number on it to make sure it actually exists nremember you cant buy a printed ticket for swifts eras tour all transfers have to be done through ticketmasters app or website so if someone offers to sell you a paper ticket walk awayn entertainment  arts nplenty of parking spots are still available for swifts shows but not in the lots on the stadium grounds for those youll have to go through a reseller and pay even morenjuly  nfinally announcing on social media that youre looking for tickets will make you a magnet for scammers nlongtime taylor swift fan krista smith illustrates this point and a few other pitfalls faced her fellow swifties a native of vancouver smith figured that while she was in southern california for summer vacation she might try to get lastminute tickets to the eras tour at sofi she watched ticket prices drop during the opening acts of swifts first concert here thursday sinking

that messaged me were very obvious scammers smith  said she said all three sent similar messages all mentioning that they were desperate to get rid of their tickets  the first red flagnat this rate no one is desperate she said other sketchy signs included asking for payments over paypal as friends and family instead of through the goods and services feature which provides purchase protectionnshe was still hopeful they could snag tickets through an online verified resale vendor such as vivid seats or stubhub but even as the opening acts continued prices didnt fall  and seats were going fastnwe would refresh pretty often and as we were putting tickets in our cart theyre selling she said were all dressed up were ready to go inside  it was desperatenat that point smith secured two tickets for about   our budget kind of expanded when we got to the stadium she laughed  but they werent downloaded instantly and the seller wasnt responding time kept ticking by swift took the stage and smith and her friend were still stuck waitingnvivid seats eventually refunded  them for the tickets and the friends listened outside for a while traded some friendship bracelets and bought some merch nits ok

122,advertisementnsupported bynmovies like taylor swift the eras tour rely on savvy tricks and sophisticated techniques to capture a semblance of the live experiencenby calum marshntaylor swifts globespanning eras tour is one of the musical events of the year drawing recordbreaking crowds and making headlines the world over since it kicked off in glendale ariz in march rabid demand has made procuring a ticket notoriously difficult if not practically impossible but starting friday swifties will have a more accessible opportunity to catch a glimpse of the live phenomenon when the concert film taylor swift the eras tour is released by amc theaters  a moviegoing event that is widely expected to be a box office smashnfilmed over three nights in august at sofi stadium in inglewood calif and directed by sam wrench the eras tour like most concert films aims to capture some of the magic of seeing the artist perform live the main thing were trying to do is provide the theatrical audience with the best seat in the house john ross the rerecording mixer on the eras tour and a veteran of many other hit concert films including jonathan demmes justin timberlake  the tennessee kids said by phone if you were to attend a concert and get the premium seat thats my job to convey that image sonically and situationallynbut capturing a live performance is not as straightforward as simply setting up some cameras and microphones and recording what transpires onstage the demands of a film are incredibly complicated and faithfully reproducing the look and sound of a concert for the screen is an arduous and painstaking process for the filmmakers and their crews its a delicate proposition  a proposition some filmmakers believe is inherently doomednthe idea itself to film a concert is a bad idea said jonas akerlund a film and music video director who made the concert movies on the run tour beyonc and jayz live and taylor swift the  world tour livenhe explained it will never ever be as good as the live experience its basically like trying to film fireworks  everybody knows that seeing it live is not the same as seeing it on a tv screen but akerlund added the concert film can have value if looked at in a different way you can make it an equally good experience but it has to be a filmic or cinematic experience rather than trying to compete with the live experiencenthe secret to cinematic merit he said is having the time and means to shoot it like a proper movie that means hiring upward of  camera operators shooting over multiple nights deploying drones spidercams and gopros and setting aside a separate dress rehearsal day when the artist plays without a crowd to shoot extra footage like closeups that might not have been possible during the live show all of the footage is assembled in the editing room with the precision of a fourminute music video to create the illusion that what youre seeing was unfolding in real time i guess its cheating a little bit akerlund saidnthese kinds of cheats are common and to hear filmmakers tell it necessary when the crazy rich asians director jon m chu made justin bieber never say never he shot the performance and the audience on separate nights then edited them together because that paradoxically made the audiences reaction feel more authentic i always love concert films where it feels like the audience is really there he said but because of the cameras the sound recording equipment and the lighting audiences dont react as big as they would on an ordinary night you try to emulate what it feels like he saidnone of the most surprising things about the making of concert films is just how much tends to be emulated even simulated rather than merely captured as is the actual sound of music being played live in an arena cant merely be taped just a recording of the room would be useless ross said instead dozens of microphones  sometimes more than  for larger sites  record the vocals instruments and crowd on separate tracks and a rerecording mixer carefully blends them together adding reverb and echo to simulate the sound of the spacenin other words the tone of the room is essentially applied like a filter to the raw sounds recorded from the artist onstage this filter known as impulse response takes readings from actual physical places then synthetically reproduces the sound of a real space like a club or stadium said jake davis the lead mix engineer at seismic sound an audio facility in nashville that specializes in concert filmsnmixers like jake and his father tom davis the seismic founder have a lot of control over the sound in a concert film and making adjustments is a large part of their job some are minor refinements others are more like corrections they make the concert film sound more like what the artist wanted than what necessarily occurred on the night it was filmed when you lock something down for a dvd or for streaming or whatever it is once its done it lives forever tom davis said it never goes away so you kind of want it to be as good as it can benmixers can blend parts of a song recorded on one night with parts from another night to create the best combined version they can fix an errant flat note in a guitar solo by manipulating it in postproduction or they can ask an artist to rerecord a weak vocal in a studio layering it into the mix so that it sounds as if it had been delivered live we copy cut and paste like you do on a word processor davis said if there was a little clam in the first chorus but he did it fine in the second chorus in the same part we can cut and paste that we can do vocal maintenance we can fix a little pitch issue or bend a note a little bitnalthough sound mixers record the crowd with a bevy of microphones hidden around the arena its possible  and indeed common  to exaggerate the sound of that audience to artificially give the cheering fans some extra kick its kind of a dirty secret davis said but the sound of the real audience is weak its not enough you end up adding to it pumping it up theres something psychological to hearing other humans having a good time and reacting  its like a sitcom and a laugh track jake davis said that the ideal balance is to start with the real reaction and then simply make it bigger and more obviousnof course part of the appeal of a live show even on film is the impression of reality and a sense of truth is critical the goal of the mix is to enhance the energy of the performance that exists as it went down in the best way possible jake davis said you maintain some element of rawness while taking out things that are distracting the nuances of a wrong note or a background singer being a little bit offnwhile the film version strives to be as good as it can be for the rest of history he said theres a fine line between correcting something a little bit and making it perfect because its not going to be perfect live its a bit like touching up a portrait in photoshop its tempting to clear blemishes but too much airbrushing can make you look fakenpaul dugdale the director of shawn mendes live in concert and taylor swift reputation stadium tour said that while some live shows might lend themselves to maximum authenticity as an approach other huge pop concerts dont emphasize the authentic in the same way for shows that are quite theatrical theres a level of artifice  theyve got screens theyve got pyrotechnics theyve got costumes all that kind of stuff he said for someone like taylor i think that allows you to explore further in terms of camera angles and putting the audience in different positionsna swift concert dugdale pointed out can last more than three hours which affords the director more latitude in how to approach the film formally you can create texture just like the live show has texture he said sometimes you can go heavyhanded with the directors hand and sometimes you can completely let go of the steering wheel and let the artist take overndespite the high level of difficulty the job for filmmakers and sound engineers is quite thankless the best concert films will to the unwitting viewer seem like nothing more than filmed concerts  the filmmaking itself remains invisiblenthe goal is that you dont want people thinking about the fact that this was worked on or changed at all from what it was live jake davis told me you just want the audience to be immersed in the experience and to accept that its happening in front of them  to feel like theyre there nbut dugdale noted that however much he tries to plan out a concert shoot the live aspect will always prove unpredictable making these films you can be as prepared as you can possibly be but in the end you have to hold on for dear life and see how it turns

studios and musicians  oh you bet they are paying attention mia galuppo wrote about it for the hollywood reportermia galuppo its a situation where theres a lot of money to be had its a space that hasnt really been looked into much by artists because it hasnt really been embraced by exhibitors by hollywood but as with anything where taylor swift goes many people follow so as soon as people started seeing the success that swift had people have started paying attentionchang well beyonce is going to be coming out with her own concert film next month right so im just thinking yeah ok she is also a huge global economic force like taylor swift i guess my question is is there even space for smaller or lesserknown artists to come out with concert films or do you have to be a megahuge star to draw people out to theatersgaluppo no you dont have to be you know this beyonce or taylor swiftlevel star which you know are two of the top recording artists of all time i was talking to the head of the national association of theater owners he made a great comparison where just as at the summer box office you see the blockbusters you know the marvels of the world you also see those independent films that still make a lot of moneychang well what about artists who are no longer alive like i noticed you wrote in your piece there might be a s david bowie concert film coming to theaters soon how big of a draw is archival stuff like that these daysgaluppo a really interesting thing happened recently with the film stop making sense which is the talking heads film that was recently rereleased by a sixty percent of that opening weekend audience was actually under the age of  which means that the majority of that audience that was going to see that film wasnt even born when the talking heads were a band they had disbanded by that point so its really fascinating and that movie did incredibly well at the box office so there is this market there which exhibitors are trying to say please make more of this type of film because audiences as evidenced by something like stop making sense or taylor swiftchang yeahgaluppo are going to show up to the theaterschang but are these new concert films that are coming out more of the same  because i mean way before taylor there was already a pretty large canon of concert films from aretha franklin to led zeppelin from prince to the talking heads as you mentioned is there anything that sets taylor swifts film apart that maybe would signal a new direction for this whole genregaluppo yes definitely one of my sources who has been in the concert and live performance film space for a long while said a very interesting thing which was concert films were ruined by poor execution the technology just wasnt there it was a situation where you set up three cameras you were looking at the stage and thats not a very cinematic experiencechang yeahgaluppo for the eras tour which filmed over multiple nights at her sofi stadium tour here in los angeles it employed a small armada of cameras and cameramenchang how many are we talkinggaluppo we are talking upwards of  according to reportschang wowgaluppo and this is including not just stationary cameras but drones and cranes you know this is a situation where the barrier to entry for that technology has lowered for artists and you are able to create an incredibly cinematic experience and that is somethingchang yeahgaluppo that  you know when i was there for the opening weekend of the eras tour in theaters thats something that you know fellow moviegoers told me was so exciting to them  is it was the closest thing to being there without being there it is that communal cinematic experience that is beautiful on its ownchang mia galuppo is a film writer at the hollywood reporter thank you

where taylor swift goes many people follow so as soon as people started seeing the success that swift had people have started paying attentionnchang well beyonce is going to be coming out with her own concert film next month right so im just thinking yeah ok she is also a huge global economic force like taylor swift i guess my question is is there even space for smaller or lesserknown artists to come out with concert films or do you have to be a megahuge star to draw people out to theatersngaluppo no you dont have to be you know this beyonce or taylor swiftlevel star which you know are two of the top recording artists of all time i was talking to the head of the national association of theater owners he made a great comparison where just as at the summer box office you see the blockbusters you know the marvels of the world you also see those independent films that still make a lot of moneynchang well what about artists who are no longer alive like i noticed you wrote in your piece there might be a s david bowie concert film coming to theaters soon how big of a draw is archival stuff like that these daysngaluppo a really interesting thing happened recently with the film stop making sense which is the talking heads film that was recently rereleased by a sixty percent of that opening weekend audience was actually under the age of  which means that the majority of that audience that was going to see that film wasnt even born when the talking heads were a band they had disbanded by that point so its really fascinating and that movie did incredibly well at the box office so there is this market there which exhibitors are trying to say please make more of this type of film because audiences as evidenced by something like stop making sense or taylor swiftnchang yeahngaluppo are going to show up to the theatersnchang but are these new concert films that are coming out more of the same  because i mean way before taylor there was already a pretty large canon of concert films from aretha franklin to led zeppelin from prince to the talking heads as you mentioned is there anything that sets taylor swifts film apart that maybe would signal a new direction for this whole genrengaluppo yes definitely one of my sources who has been in the concert and live performance film space for a long while said a very interesting thing which was concert films were ruined by poor execution the technology just wasnt there it was a situation where you set up three cameras you were looking at the stage and thats not a very cinematic experiencenchang yeahngaluppo for the eras tour which filmed over multiple nights at her sofi stadium tour here in los angeles it employed a small armada of cameras and cameramennchang how many are we talkingngaluppo we are talking upwards of  according to reportsnchang wowngaluppo and this is including not just stationary cameras but drones and cranes you know this is a situation where the barrier to entry for that technology has lowered for artists and you are able to create an incredibly cinematic experience and that is somethingnchang yeahngaluppo that  you know when i was there for the opening weekend of the eras tour in theaters thats something that you know fellow moviegoers told me was so exciting to them  is it was the closest thing to being there without being there it is that communal cinematic experience that is beautiful on its ownnchang mia galuppo is a film writer at the hollywood reporter thank you so much miangaluppo thank you so much for having mencopyright   npr  all rights reserved  visit our

neckandneck with joker which opened with  million in  as the biggest october release of all timenwhat makes the  pictures enormous haul even more remarkable is that six weeks ago it wasnt even on

necessarily start hounding their managers to try to score them the kind of deal that swift and beyonc havenpeople keep saying will this now open the floodgates  dergarabedian says well that would presume theres a deep bench of musical artists who could create this kind of demand for a concert movie its a great formula for success for this very unique style of release with very unique artists that operate in an orbit that very few stars do in any realm taylor swift is in her own orbit and has this gravitational pull on everything elsenindeed swift is a veritable onewoman marketing machine

402,travis kelce has been catching a lot more than footballs lately and fans everywhere have been swift to hop on the taylor swift bandwagon the celebrity couple has been in the news for well over a week now and despite the fatigue from many chris mad dog russos rant being among the most vocal  companies like fanduel just cant help but lean into a profitable storyline are they for real or is this love story just some extravagant publicity stuntntime will tell but one things for certain when it comes to the media social media newspapers football fans swifties and just about everyone else within the  states and us territories including puerto rico and guam you need to calm down regardless kelce and swift take their tour on the road to broadway a place that puts on all the great shows the traditional circus hasnt been in town for a few years now but thats simply because the new york jets exist and there was only room for one it seems like ages since aaron rodgers marched out of the metlife stadium tunnel holding an american flag but this is zach wilsons team now whether you like it or notnone of the most hyped sunday night football games of the year was expected to feature rodgers against patrick mahomes for the first time instead were more likely to be treated to nonstop split screens involving swift and rodgers two people who wont be on the field there will be some actual football though even if it is just a sideshow to the event everyone cant stop talking about so buckle up and enjoy whatever this is and for all the fans paying ridiculous prices for a glimpse of ms swift  make sure your phone is chargednto travis and taylor welcome to new york its been waiting for you well actually the swamps of northern new jersey have enjoy the traffic and a look at the famous skylinenfor bettors where there is hype theres also an opportunity to make some money fanduel has released a special prop bets menu cleverly called prop stars for the swiftinspired wagers heres a look at how you can catch some cash in prime timenmorejets vs chiefs betting previewnthe jets know that kelce is trouble long before he even walks in if they want any chance in this game theyll have to slow down no  this is a new york defense thats been very good although not quite great over the last year and continues to improve robert salehs troops have held opponents in check giving their anemic offense a fighting chance most weeks but if theres one thing that gang green struggles to defend against its the tight end theyre giving up the fifthmost receiving yards to the position this season  and just allowed pharoah brown to beat them for a long yard touchdown last sunday getting  is a nice price for the best passcatcher in this game but theres too much blowout potential to warrant taking a flier herenour pickpassnif this bet ends up cashing the seeing red tagline would apply to a lot more than just chiefs fans bettors would be in the green and those wearing green would be the ones with redish cartoonlike faces odds are wilson would have to be atrocious again considering new yorks defense isnt a pushover the jets often like to make games close even when they seemingly have no business in doing so even if they are steamrolled a garbage time score is more than enough to ruin this wagernour pickpassnout of all the specials this one is our favorite the chiefs will likely score first whether they get the opening kickoff or not when we look at the jets we see an offensive coordinator that somehow underrated micah parsons and a team that refuses to take the training wheels off their former gunslinging quarterback wilson has turned into checkdown charlie as a result of conservative coaching and we dont expect that to change in the early going lean into the narrative and sprinkle a little cash on kelce to break the plane firstnour pickbet on itnobviously based on our last recommendation were friendzoning this bet and not laying down any action on itnour pickpassnthe strength of the jets roster is along the defensive line and the chiefs are a passfirst team that loves to light it up through the air this is the first time that patrick mahomes is playing in the new york area hell want to put on a show and andy reid certainly isnt going to hold him back dont expect the chiefs to start running until its time to chew the clocknour pickpassnranch is a fine condiment and beloved by many which makes this wager something that should be seen as an insult to ranch fans everywhere unless the jets make this a close game or send it to overtime we have a hard time believing that kelce will even be on the field to score the last touchdown avoid this one like people with taste buds avoid bleu cheese and treat your nuggets with respectnour pickpassnif you asked the average jets fan what is holding this roster back the overwhelming results would be wilson im the problem its me would probably qualify as the lyrics played in his walkup song if fans had anything to say about it but wilson doesnt have time to be the antihero or villain as traditionalists would say he needs to flip the script and shake it off the jets need to let him sling the ball around the field instead of worrying about the bad turnovers they arent winning this game  and they arent winning anything if they cant let their quarterback be who he is are we betting this absolutely not but that would be one heck of a plot twist right perhaps the script writers are working overtimenour pickpassnwhen it comes to kelces greatest hits he prefers to save them for division rivals like the raiders and chargers in your wildest dreams this bet might hit and it might happen in reality too kelce could be schmoozing in the suite when the second half begins rather than throwing blocks and catching footballs on the field but if the jets keep it close they are prone to being exploited by players like kelce with receivers lacking on the chiefs sideline the tight end might put on a show that is typically only found in show business considering he hosted saturday night live back in march kelce is familiar with how to tell a story we have him scoring once so whats another two times to cash a monster long shot dont count on it but dont rule it out either and please have fun and bet responsiblynour pickbet on it with a small wagernthe jets are currently back in a familiar place as the laughingstock of the nfl swift like many celebrities has plenty of exes but she always scores again maybe the haters are right maybe kelce will be the subject of the next big hit maybe the publicists are cashing checks with this brilliant idea maybe its real time will tell but when the relationship inevitably falls apart like most dream celebrity couples do there is always another someone point is the jets are without the quarterback they married and now theyre back together with wilson its not glamorous but theyll score again shutting out nfl teams is no easy task but the chiefs defense is much improved and the jets look like a team that doesnt have a quarterback dont consider it likely to hit but  wagers hardly ever are consider this a fun bet unless youre a jets fan and see how long kc can keep nyc off the scoreboard they might just do it for the entire gamenour pickbet on it with a small wagernnick brinkerhoff is an editorial intern at the sporting

incandescent its almost celestialnthats the story of taylor swift and travis kelce the reigning prince and princess of american pop culture but its also the plot of a recent work of erotic fan fiction which some readers  many of whom are fans of ms swift  are decrying as an invasion of privacynin a sincedeleted tiktok video which is still available on her facebook page an independent romance author who publishes under the name ivy smoak announced the release of a short ebook in the video ms smoak claims to have written the novel in three days after receiving requests from readers for a spicy romance inspired by ms swift and mr kelces relationship according to the trailer the book would involve a pop star princess a football superstar a sassy heroine and a secret relationshipnon sept  less than a week after ms swifts first appearance at a kansas city chiefs game ms smoak published roughing the princess to kindles direct publishing platform which made it available for purchase on any kindle device and as a free download for kindle unlimited subscribersnthe cover of the ebook features a cartoon image of a blonde pop star shown from behind she is holding a microphone and wearing a red football jersey emblazoned with the number  while the book claims to be inspired by the reallife romance of ms swift and mr kelce and starts out with a disclaimer stating that any resemblance to actual persons living or dead events or locales is purely coincidental many readers felt that the attempt at shipping  the act of imagining or championing a relationship between celebrities  hewed too close to reality and they flocked to twitter tiktok and goodreads to denounce it as inappropriate xrated fan fictionnin a review on goodreads a user with the screen name isabella called the book almost creepy in a star review if i could give this  stars i would she said i love shipping tstk but this makes it weirdnto followers of booktok  the nickname for tiktoks avid reader community  there is a clear distinction between books that are loosely based on real people and those that are real person fiction a subgenre of fan fiction in which amateur authors create unauthorized fictional stories involving real peoplenmany on booktok felt that roughing the princess which borrows exact details of mr kelce and ms swifts biography and romance while using nearly direct quotes from mr kelces interviews and podcasts read more like real person fiction than an inspired by story that fact coupled with the books graphic sex scenes left many readers feeling uncomfortably voyeuristic as if by simply reading the book theyd participated in violating their favorite pop stars privacy devoted fans of ms swift felt duped and disgustednits fine to write a fanfic and its fine to write smut but when you combine the two and then try to pass it off as an inspired story when its very obviously about two real people thats not ok thats not right thats gross said gina burgess  a tiktok creator who lives in florida ms burgess made a video declaring roughing the princess to be the worst book ive ever read in my entire lifeni read a lot of other books that have smut in them and ive never felt gross after them but this one i did ms burgess saidnother roughing the princess readers echoed this sentiment in videos posted to tiktok and twitternthis is not what the girlies wanted when we said we wanted a football star meets pop star inspired romance book kayla compton a social media manager for authors who has more than  followers on tiktok said in a review it just felt like a gimmick to make some moneynms compton  said that as a football fan a swiftie and an avid reader she felt compelled to finish the book even though she wanted to stop reading after the first few pages i felt like i had to review it ms compton said and i dont ever do negative reviews so the fact that i did it speaks to how much she shouldnt have written itnms compton pointed to the book the playlist by morgan elizabeth as a good example of a spicy romance that was inspired by ms swift but isnt explicitly about her personal lifenshortly after ms smoak published roughing the princess online it was yanked from amazon and almost all mentions of it were scrubbed from ms smoaks social platforms its unclear whether amazon unpublished the book or if ms smoak took it down herself its also unclear if it was taken down as a response to reader feedback or if there were potential legal or copyright reasons for the decision ms smoak and representatives for ms swift did not respond to requests for commentninstead of wiping the books existence from her social media and continuing to post about unrelated subjects some booktok users expressed that they would have preferred for ms smoak to have taken accountability for the release of roughing the princess and apologizeni think she could have come out and said hey guys i messed up said ms burgess im going to take time to examine what i should be writing and not take real events and make them into smutnthis isnt the first time ms swifts love life has been the topic of fan fiction her close friendship with the model karlie kloss has long been a source of celesbian fan fiction for socalled kaylor devotees who believe the two secretly fostered a romantic relationship but many fans felt that ms smoaks book crossed a line by including graphic conversations and sex scenes involving two characters so clearly modeled in the image of ms swift and mr kelce especially when ms swift has been consistently vocal about how much she dislikes speculation about her love lifenif youre writing a kaylor book thats not real life youre imagining things said ms compton she also pointed out that fan fiction is typically free whereas copies of roughing the princess were on sale for  fan fiction either is written about fictional characters or if its about real people it still has a large element of fiction and its free ms compton said when you write a spicy fanfic story and youre paywalling it thats when it gets weirdnadvertisement,Unrelated,-1,Dating,,FALSE,
