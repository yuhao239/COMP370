His reasoning behind the idea appears to show that he may not have the 33-year-old singer-songwriter's love life on the top of his mind, however. /nWatch out, #TravisKelce! #MarkCuban shoots his shot at #TaylorSwift ... in a way  https://t.co/OyBl6jNIbN pic.twitter.com/ocRuTBV3bo/n""Taylor Swift impacts the economy,"" Cuban said.

[+] Awards in Düsseldorf, on November 13, 2022. (Photo by Sascha Schuermann / AFP) (Photo by SASCHA SCHUERMANN/AFP via Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift has maintained her very significant presence on Spotify ever since her music reappeared on the platform a few years ago. Now, the accomplished singer-songwriter has made history on the streaming giant, with even Spotify itself celebrating her latest achievement./nIn a recent announcement on its social media platforms, Spotify proudly shared that Swift has officially become the first woman to amass an astounding 100 million monthly active listeners. This impressive feat means that over the course of the last month, a staggering 100 million distinct individuals from all parts of the globe have tuned in to enjoy at least one of the superstar's tracks./nWhile Swift may be the first woman to hit this remarkable milestone on the world's largest streaming platform, it's worth noting that, when considering all artists, she ranks second./nEarlier this year, The Weeknd secured the distinction of being the first musician to surpass the 100 million monthly listeners mark. In February, the Canadian pop and R&B sensation accomplished this groundbreaking feat, setting a new standard for streaming accomplishments. He now claims just under 110 million monthly listeners./nNumerous factors are currently contributing to Swift's exceptional performance on Spotify. The artist has always had a knack for attracting listeners, but August has proven to be particularly fruitful. Her most recent album, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), which was released just a month ago, continues to enjoy robust streams. Additionally, her track ""Cruel Summer,"" from the 2019 album Lover, is currently among the platform's most-played songs./nMeanwhile, anticipation for the re-release of her earlier album 1989 this fall has sparked renewed interest in the original version as well. Some casual fans may be busy returning to that collection following her announcement that she’s re-recording it, as many of the songs featured on it have jumped in consumption./nAll of these events are helping Swift’s performance on Spotify, but it’s important to note that what’s most impressive is the fact that her music is reaching a larger audience than ever. The 100 million number being reported doesn’t specifically focus on those playing one tune and moving on or super fans streaming everything she’s released—it’s simply about the number of people tuning in. Her reach is expanding, and that’s impressive, considering how popular she has been for so many years./n",7.401537268,1,Achievements,1

/nTaylor Swift‘s Eras Tour has been a mainstay in pop culture over the last year. Those who didn’t catch Swift along her lauded trek now have a chance to witness all the action when the movie version of the tour premieres on October 13. While we eagerly wait for the movie, check out five things we can expect from the release below. /n[RELATED: 7 of Taylor Swift’s Favorite Songs]/nSince we know which shows were filmed for use in the movie, we have a short list of which surprise songs could appear on the big screen. The first three of six shows in Los Angeles were captured for the concert film. Among the options from those shows are “I Can See You,” “Maroon,” “Our Song,” “You Are in Love,” “Death by a Thousand Cuts,” and “You’re on Your Own, Kid.” It’s a stacked list. Any way you cut it, the Swifties will be pleased. /nHAIM was one of the featured opening acts for Swift’s Los Angeles shows. Each night of her six-night stand, the trio joined Swift for a rendition of their evermore collaboration, “no body, no crime.” If you had FOMO over missing Swift and HAIM ham it up on stage together, fret not. One of their performances will likely be featured in the movie. /nWhile much of the Eras Tour is focused on Swift’s upbeat anthems, there are a few emotional moments throughout. From “champagne problems” to “marjorie,” there is a good chance some tears could be shed. Swift herself has gotten emotional over the course of the tour performing those songs. We can only imagine how affecting they will be in high def. /nJust a few days after the release of the movie, Swift will share 1989 (Taylor’s Version). The hype for her latest re-recording project will likely only grow after watching Swift perform cuts from the blockbuster record. Across the setlist, Swift plays “Blank Space,” “Style,” “Shake It Off,” “Bad Blood,” and “Wildest Dreams.” The anthems are undisputed bangers and are guaranteed to get fans excited for the updated versions. /nThe Eras Tour movie doesn’t abide by typical movie-going standards. There will be no silencing your phone or sitting quietly so as to not disturb your fellow audience members. Swift hopes the movie will be an extension of the actual tour. That means the seats will be packed with passionate fans, screaming at the top of their lungs in over-the-top outfits. If you aren’t Swift’s biggest fan, perhaps avoid your local theater for a few days, it will officially become Swiftie territory as of October 13. /nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)/n(Allen J.

Indeed, Swift made news in recent days by awarding her road crew up to $100,000 each as a personal thank you for the hard work during the tour. She’s also partnered with local charitable organizations on her tour stops, such as a food bank in Santa Clara./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nIt’s hard to imagine a more pro-worker perspective, and seemingly one that Los Angeles would welcome to town./nBut according to Local 11’s twisted logic, Swift is obligated to reschedule because her visiting fans will be staying at LA-area hotels, including some of the hotels where workers may currently be on strike. This selfish perspective is on-brand for Local 11, which in recent weeks has made news for deliberately disrupting a wedding and 4th of July tourism to advance its goals during the strike./nRelated Articles

Set aside for a minute the flawed argument that the entire LA economy should suffer because of labor disputes at a handful of union properties. The fault for the ongoing strike lies with union leadership, not the hotels and certainly not the excited Taylor fans coming to Los Angeles. The union has stubbornly prolonged the dispute with demands that hotels support a Los Angeles ballot measure that would require them to house the homeless alongside paying guests./nWith a potential transformation of these hotels into makeshift homeless shelters, good luck getting tourists to stay there for Taylor’s next tour stop in Los Angeles./nFor related news, see: Eleni Kounalakis hypocritically calls for Taylor Swift to cancel shows after attending concert/nAlso on the list of demands is a new hotel tax of seven percent, which guests would pay into a trust fund controlled by the union. The union claims the money would go towards affordable housing, but the language of the fund gives it broad latitude to spend the money on “other efforts” as well./nAs of this writing, Swift seems poised to ignore the union’s unreasonable demands, picking the local economy and thousands of fans over the tantrums of Kurt Peterson and his cronies at Local 11. The tour dates will no doubt be a success, and should also serve as a lesson to other celebrities and politicians who face a Local 11 call for a boycott: There’s no harm in shaking off the unreasonable demands of Los Angeles labor unions./nMichael Saltsman is Executive Director at the Employment Policies Institute",-18.99651676,8,Tour,1

      Taylor Swift was clearly ready for some more football on Sunday, as were Deadpool, Wolverine and Ant-Man. 
  /n
      More on the Marvel stars in a moment.
  /n
      As was highly expected/speculated, Swift was in the crowd at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday night to cheer on tight end Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs as they play on the road against the New York Jets.
  /n
      Swift, who has been recently getting to know Kelce and sparking the creativity of brand marketers everywhere, was shown on the NBC broadcast about 30 minutes prior to the game, alongside Blake Lively, Lively’s husband Ryan Reynolds (of “Deadpool” fame) and Sophie Turner.

      Other stars photographed at the game include “Free Guy” director Shawn Levy, with Reynolds and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine of the “X-Men” movies), Paul Rudd (“Ant-Man”), and for those sorely missing their Sunday “Succession” fix, actor Jeremy Strong.

      Last week, Swift was at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, sitting next to Kelce’s mother, Donna, as they watched the Chiefs achieve a 41-10 victory over the Chicago Bears. After the game, the “Cruel Summer” singer was spotted leaving the stadium with Kelce.
  /n
      Anticipation the 12-time Grammy Award winner would make another appearance at this weekend’s game sent ticket prices surging more than 40%, according to TickPick, an online marketplace.

Taylor Swift's attendance at Chiefs game brings a spike in Travis Kelce jersey sales
/n
      Swift’s NFL interest has been a hit in more ways than one. Sales of Kelce’s jersey “saw a nearly 400% spike in sales” on Monday, Fanatics previously told CNN.
/n
      Even TV ratings have seen a boost. Last weekend’s game was the “highest among female demographics across” various age groups, according to Variety.
  /n
      The final score was Chiefs 23 - 20 over the Jets.
  /n
      With Swift in the audience, however, everybody won.

The news was shared by the streamer, which put the inclusion of Swift’s song front-and-center, almost mentioning the actual promotion of the show as a bonus./n""Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version)"" is set to serve as the opening title song for the much-anticipated Amazon Prime Video series. According to a release shared by the company, the upcoming thriller is described as such:/n“Liv becomes the actress starring in Will’s bad dreams after she learns about his betrayal, and her heartbreak is swiftly followed by another emotion: fury. The couple embark on an American road trip Liv’s fantasised about since she was little, from the Grand Canyon on through Yosemite, before ending up with a hedonistic weekend in Las Vegas. For Will, it’s a chance to make amends; for Liv, it’s a very different prospect—a landscape where accidents happen all the time. The perfect place to get revenge. Look what he made her do…”/nFans can hear the first taste of the updated take of ""Look What You Made Me Do” on now, with the show premiering on September 15./nThis is not the first time that Swift has allowed one of her re-recordings to be used in this manner. In fact, it’s not even the first time a tune from the future Reputation (Taylor’s Version) has been utilized in such a manner. Earlier this month, her re-recorded rendition of ""Delicate,"" a popular single from her Reputation era, was featured in the latest season of Amazon Prime Video’s The Summer I Turned Pretty./nThat move, which was not announced, was thrilling to fans watching the show. They caught the slightly altered take and the clip quickly went viral online, with many clamoring to hear even a snippet of the upcoming Reputation (Taylor’s Version)./n""Look What You Made Me Do"" was a fast chart-topper when it was originally released back in 2017. The tune went right to No. 1 on the Hot 100, giving the singer her fifth leader, at the time./nAs the lead single from her Reputation album, the track signified a significant shift in Swift's musical direction. Infused with darker tones and more electronic elements, the song ventured into new territories while retaining Swift's signature lyrical prowess. The smash’s thematic depth focused on Swift's experiences with media scrutiny, fame and even her public conflicts, notably including her feud with Kanye West./nThe strategic incorporation of songs from the re-recorded version of Reputation, soon to be titled Reputation (Taylor's Version), into visual projects raises tantalizing speculations about the impending album release. Despite this thrilling prospect, fans will need to exercise a bit of patience before they can savor the full collection of re-recorded gems./nWhile she may be teasing Reputation (Taylor's Version), it’s not likely that the album is coming soon, as Swift has already announced her next project. During a recent stop on her The Eras Tour, the star confirmed that the next of her albums to receive the re-recording treatment will be 1989, and it will be available in late October./n",14.52324167,12,Discography,0

But Swift and Beyoncé are cultural forces whose tours continue breaking records./nBy Eduardo Medina/nGannett, the largest newspaper chain in the United States, has announced that it would hire reporters to cover two of the biggest names in music: Taylor Swift and Beyoncé./nAmid the zeal around both artists’ record-breaking tours this year, Gannett said in separate announcements on Tuesday and Wednesday that it was looking for two reporters who could capture the significance of their music, their growing legacies and the effect both women have had across the music world./nThe two reporters would be writing for USA Today and The Tennessean, the publisher’s newspaper in Nashville, where Swift began her career as a country darling before selling out stadiums across North America on her record-breaking Eras Tour./nIn its job description for the Beyoncé reporting job, Gannett said on Wednesday that it was seeking a journalist who could cover how the “international superstar and icon’s impact is felt across generations,” and how she has been “a force in everything from how the country views race to how women think about their partners.”/nGannett said on Tuesday that the reporter covering Swift would have to “identify why the pop star’s influence only expands, what her fan base stands for in pop culture.”/nThe jobs reflect the frenzied fandom that has surrounded both Swift and Beyoncé, who is also currently touring across the world./nSwift’s cultural resonance seems to deepen with each album, including the re-recordings of her old music. Her fans have spent thousands of dollars on concert tickets and shook the ground so hard at one concert that it registered as an earthquake on a seismometer near Seattle./nAt Beyoncé shows, fans dress up in attire inspired by cosmic cowboys and cowgirls, filling up stadiums in silver and glittery hats and boots. They follow her subtle cues, seas of people going silent as she sings the line “Look around everybody on mute,” from the 2022 song “Energy,” and have held up blue balloons to celebrate performances by her daughter Blue Ivy Carter. Billboard reported that her Renaissance World Tour had the biggest one-month gross in boxscore history in July./nReactions to the Swift job posting on Tuesday had been mixed, including praise for Gannett for trying to reach a new audience and criticism over how the company has laid off local journalists in recent years./nKristin Roberts, Gannett’s chief content officer, said in a statement on Tuesday night that the USA Today Network, which the company owns, is committed to serving its readers with essential journalism, and that “includes providing our audience with content they crave.”/n“As Taylor Swift’s fan base has grown to unprecedented heights, so has the influence of her music and growing legacy — not only on the industry but on our culture,” Ms. Roberts said. “She is shaping a generation and is relevant, influential and innovative — just like us.”/nNewspapers often employ music critics and entertainment reporters, but rarely assign a reporter to cover a single artist./nThe popularity of Swift, though, has proved to be a powerful force over the summer, culturally and economically./nA Federal Reserve survey of business contacts reported that Swift fans, or Swifties, had bolstered hotel revenues in the Philadelphia region. Although Swift, 33, and her promoters do not publicly report box-office figures, the trade publication Pollstar estimates that she has been selling about $14 million in tickets each night. By the end of her planned world tour, which is booked with 146 stadium dates well into 2024, Swift’s sales could reach $1.4 billion or more — exceeding Elton John’s $939 million for his multiyear farewell tour, the current record-holder./nSome journalists expressed concern about Gannett’s reporting priorities. Last December, Gannett cut about 6 percent of the company’s roughly 3,440-person U.S. media division. Media analysts said the move could worsen the state of the local news industry, which has shrunk in recent years, creating information deserts in communities across the country./nLaura D. Testino, a reporter for Chalkbeat Tennessee, said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that while Nashville is getting a Swift reporter, “Memphis is still without an investigative reporter.”/nGannett has hired 225 journalists since March and now has more than 100 open roles, Ms. Roberts said./nRobert Thompson, the director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, said on Tuesday that hiring for such specific beats “is not as absurd as it looks at first glance.”/nIn an increasingly fragmented cultural environment, “where mass culture has broken up into a million little pieces,” he said, there is an increased value to the one thing that emerges that essentially everyone can comment on./n“You cannot be conscious in the United States without on some level having to come to grips with Taylor Swift,” Dr. Thompson said. Covering someone like her, he added, is a “perfectly sound activity for a journalist to be doing.”/nEduardo Medina is a reporter covering breaking news.

(Photo by John Shearer/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nIt’s been assumed for years now that CDs are all but a dead format in America. While the shiny plastic discs have been making something of a comeback lately, they are still nowhere near as popular as they used to be. In a surprising twist, Taylor Swift’s new album was so successful on CD that it defies a years-long downward trend and highlights her immense popularity./nSwift’s just-dropped 1989 (Taylor’s Version) opens at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 this week with the largest opening sum of 2023—and also of her career. The set starts atop the ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. with more than 1.6 million equivalent units shifted, including both sales and streams./nIncluded in that massive figure are 554,000 copies sold on CD. That number is so large that if 1989 (Taylor’s Version) had only been released on CD, it still would have gone to No. 1 on the Billboard 200. In fact, it wouldn’t have faced any real competition, despite the fact that millions of Americans–including some superfans of the singer–might not even have a way to play a CD any longer./nThis week, the No. 2 title on the Billboard 200, Seventeen’s Seventeenth Heaven, arrives with 100,000 equivalent units. That number is comprised almost entirely of pure sales, but not entirely. Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) sold more than five times that figure on CD alone./nBillboard notes that 1989 (Taylor’s Version) earns the largest sales week on CD in more than seven years. The last title to sell more copies on the format in America in a single tracking frame was Adele’s 25. That blockbuster sold 1.03 million copies on CD in a week at the end of 2015, a few farmes after it had been released./nHelping Swift sell as many copies of 1989 (Taylor’s Version) on CD as she did were the many different editions she offered. These days, many die-hard followers of a musician opt to buy a CD not as a means to hear the music, but rather as a collectible. Smart artists like Swift have leaned into this, producing several options with differing covers, tracklists, and the like./n",6.13784086,15,Achievements,1
16,Rong-Gong Lin II,Could Taylor Swift mania fuel a COVID cruel summer? What you need to know,Could Taylor Swift's mega-tour have fans seeing red on their next COVID test? Here's how officials say concertgoers can help protect themselves.,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-04/could-taylor-swift-mania-fuel-a-covid-cruel-summer-what-you-need-to-know,latimes,general,us,2023-08-04T11:00:07+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,16,"Could Taylor Swift’s mega-tour have fans seeing red on their next COVID test?/nThere has been some cautious optimism among public health officials that this summer might be the first during which California doesn’t experience a major coronavirus wave — and there’s no evidence at this point that one is on the way. /nBut California is not in the clear or out of the woods just yet. Transmission does appear to be on the upswing, and there’s no denying the virus’ enduring power to spread, particularly in crowded settings. And crowded hardly begins to describe Swift’s concerts, let alone the fan mania that has surrounded them. /n“Given the relatively low rate of COVID-19 community transmission, and the ability of everyone to take sensible precautions, we are hopeful the concerts will not significantly impact community transmission rates,” the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times./n Music /nTaylor Swift kicked off six sold-out shows at SoFi Stadium, and The Times’ Mikael Wood and Suzy Exposito were there to provide a full rundown./nAug. 3, 2023/nThere have been a handful of reports of coronavirus infections after Swift’s concerts at the outdoor Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara and elsewhere in recent weeks. But it’s unclear whether those played any more significant a role in terms of spread than other social gatherings or large events, such as the recent San Diego Comic-Con./nThe L.A. County Department of Public Health said it has not heard of other areas that have reported a notable increase in coronavirus transmission linked to Swift’s previous stops. Her tour began in March and continued amid a national downturn in COVID hospitalizations — which hit a record low in late June before ticking back upward./nBut at this point, with coronavirus case reporting uneven and largely unreliable, it would be difficult if not impossible to definitively say whether a specific event like the Swift concerts was a major factor behind an uptick in local transmission, according to the Santa Clara County Department of Public Health. /nIn general, though, coronavirus levels in wastewater have already been increasing in both Santa Clara County — Northern California’s most populous — and L.A. County, even before Swift’s arrival. Reports of COVID-19 hospitalizations and emergency department visits have also started to climb slightly in L.A. County. /n Science & Medicine /nTest positivity has ticked up in L.A. County in recent weeks, though we’re still well below peak COVID levels. If you get COVID now, here’s how to treat it, how long to isolate, how to get Paxlovid, and more information on getting healthy./nJuly 28, 2023/nWith COVID once more on the rise, experts say that concert attendees should not be completely surprised if they do fall ill afterward./n“People have to be aware that it’s a potential venue [for infection], and riskier than most venues, given all the shouting, the singing, the fact that it’s three hours — even though it’s outdoors,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious-disease expert. “You’re just bringing people together from lots of different places ... people are traveling all over the country to the city where they can get tickets. So it’s like a mega airport, or a mega transportation site, if you think about it.” /nBeing at a concert in a stadium environment, even outdoors, could potentially carry a higher risk of infection than being inside a supermarket or an airport because, at a concert, there’s a lot of “shouting and screaming,” he added./nL.A. County health officials said coronavirus transmission is possible during Swift’s six-day slate of local concerts, the first of which was Thursday. But they noted that, “fortunately, SoFi Stadium’s indoor-outdoor design can increase air circulation in most parts of the stadium, which we know helps reduce transmission.” /nThere is a fixed roof at the Inglewood venue, but its edges are open to the outdoors, letting in ocean breezes./n Science & Medicine /nIt’s 2023 and you just tested positive for COVID-19. Now what? The latest CDC protocols, isolation recommendations, ways to treat it and ways to prevent long COVID./nMarch 24, 2023/nTo be clear, the COVID-19 landscape this summer is generally far less dangerous than previously in the pandemic, with most people having a degree of immunity — from vaccinations, previous infection or a combination of the two. There’s also wide availability of anti-COVID drugs such as Paxlovid. /nStill, it would be a mistake to be completely fearless of the disease: COVID-19 remains deadly to some. Elderly individuals continue to be at higher risk, especially if they are not up-to-date on their shots. There also still is some risk of contracting long COVID any time a person is infected. /nChin-Hong said he is not suggesting anyone cancel their concert plans, and noted that Swift has been “super responsible” during the pandemic. In early 2021, as the deadliest COVID-19 surge hit the nation, Swift canceled a planned concert tour and said she “can’t wait til we can all safely be at shows together again.”/nStill, Chin-Hong said it’s important to be aware that COVID-19 spread remains a possibility. And while masks may have largely gone  out of style, they can still play a helpful role, even if used sparingly. /n“First of all, if you’re at high risk, you still could go — it’s still outdoors ... but you might want to mask if you’re immune-compromised,” Chin-Hong said. And for those who aren’t going to mask in the stands, some ways to reduce risk would be to wear a mask in more cramped spaces, like when visiting concession stands, going to the restroom, or while aboard public transit. /n California /nCalifornia politicians have asked Taylor Swift to cancel her L.A. tour dates this week in solidarity with striking hotel workers. It’s an impossible ask, but one the singer can’t ignore./nAug. 3, 2023/nAnd if you do fall ill two or three days after the concert, “you should test. A lot of people are not testing anymore. But testing is important, so you can protect people” by staying home and not spreading the infection to others, Chin-Hong said. Health officials say people who have COVID-19 need to stay home for at least five days after their first symptoms or their first positive test result, whichever came first. /nMost health plans are required under California law to reimburse insured patients for eight at-home COVID-19 tests per month, per covered person. /nIn addition, higher-risk people with COVID-19 should speak to their healthcare provider about getting prescribed an anti-COVID drug such as Paxlovid, which reduces the risk of severe illness and death and may lower the risk of developing long COVID. Paxlovid is provided to patients for free. /nPaxlovid is often prescribed for people 50 and older, but it can also be prescribed to people who are younger and have no major medical problems./n California /nNew study suggests that people with a specific version of a particular gene who got COVID were far more likely to experience an asymptomatic infection./nJuly 19, 2023/nEvery county in California is reporting a “low” COVID-19 hospital admission rate, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Based on that level, the L.A. County Department of Public Health says that for the general public, masking is up to a person’s individual preference, but the agency still recommends masking in places such as public transit and transportation hubs. /nCOVID-19 hospitalizations nationwide are among their lowest levels since the pandemic began but have started to tick upward. Nationally, there were 8,035 new COVID-19 hospitalizations for the week that ended July 22, up 12% from the prior week. In California, the comparable number is 1,366, also up 12% from the prior week. /nCalifornians who don’t have insurance or are having a hard time getting a prescription for anti-COVID medication can make a free phone or video appointment through the state’s COVID-19 telehealth service, reachable through sesamecare.com/covidca or by calling (833) 686-5051./nL.A. County has similar free telehealth services, which are accessible at (833) 540-0473.

This week, SAG-AFTRA discouraged its members from dressing up as characters from major movie studios in solidarity with the continuing actors’ strike./nAnd now an October surprise may have arrived in the form of Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce.

Pennebaker’s “Depeche Mode 101” filled Pasadena’s sylvan Rose Bowl with every goth in the Southland (some of whom Pennebaker followed on a party bus into the show). In “U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky,” the Irish rockers found a natural setting befitting their celestial aims./nThe still-gleaming SoFi doesn’t have the same mystery of a Colorado sandstone crevasse, nor is it a technological marvel like the newly opened Sphere in Las Vegas. But when SoFi debuted to the public in 2020, fans noticed the surprising intimacy of it, as far as 70,000-capacity stadiums go. The main floor is built well below ground, and the vertical rake of the seats puts more fans closer to the action. The semi-enclosed roof adds some punctuation to the scene. If you’re a performer, it creates more of a wall of bodies than a sea of them./nFor a filmmaker trying to lend intimacy to the biggest pop shows on the planet, that’s an invaluable asset./n“There is a thoughtfulness at SoFi that really added architectural texture and class to the world of our film,” said Micah Bickham,  director of “The Weeknd: Live at SoFi Stadium.” “Rather than at an older stadium with a tremendous first section, SoFi has all these different levels; it’s more of a cascading effect where the camera’s almost climbing a wall.”/nGiven its flagship industry — and proximity to the world’s best film crews — L.A.  will always be a top location to shoot a concert documentary. (Talking Heads’ 1984 film, “Stop Making Sense,” currently in re-release from A24, was shot at Hollywood’s Pantages Theatre.) Tours often begin on the East Coast and wrap up on the West Coast, meaning that a show is a well-oiled machine by the time it arrives in L.A./nNFL Media headquarters is just across the street, but even for nonfootball events, it’s still “very user friendly,” Castillo-Butcher said. “We have an in-house broadcasting and digital team to work with tours and filmmakers. The infinity screen can put images of the artist up or just augment lighting. They can get shots of the LED roof, the park, exteriors, but never impede live experience./n“It’s like the ‘Today’ show at Rockefeller Center [in New York]. It can be a studio all its own, where you wouldn’t even know you’re in a stadium.”/n Music /nShe counts Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj as mentors, and quickly catapulted into the top tier of pop stars. Now, Ice Spice has her sights set on the Grammys./nOct. 12, 2023/nBickham, for one, might not have been able to pull off his doc without the massive film infrastructure already in place. The Weeknd’s SoFi show included a confusing-at-the-time moment where he appeared alongside Lily-Rose Depp for a brief scripted scene. It would later appear in HBO’s “The Idol,” where the Weeknd, a.k.a. Abel Tesfaye, played a scuzzy svengali to Rose-Depp’s pop star./nThat scene was shot by “The Idol’s” director Sam Levinson. Having two separate film crews, with their own equipment and shot lists for entirely different projects, was a mind-bending undertaking during a live set with 70,000 people watching./n“The space was malleable enough that it didn’t impede our film,” Bickham said. “Sam and Abel and I met to establish that shot right before Abel takes the stage. We had one check-in to make space for both teams. That we were not buried in a cavernous tunnel of a decades old stadium was so helpful.”/nBickham is close friends with Sam Wrench, the director of “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,”  and while they didn’t compare notes before going in to shoot their respective SoFi projects, they both appreciated the rare opportunities within the space./n“There aren’t many places in the world where  you can create such scale and really allow the camera to enter the artist’s world,” Bickham said. “How do you create shots that feel massive in scale, yet have an intimacy within a film? SoFi is a venue with tremendous character, but it’s kind of a blank canvas too.”/nSoFi is too young to have much history yet. (The 2022 Super Bowl Halftime show, featuring locals Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar, paid homage to the landmarks of Compton just a few miles away.) But the venue will host 19 concerts in 2023 (the final being Travis Scott on Nov. 5). It wouldn’t be surprising if more docs emerge from this gold rush year./nCastillo-Butcher, meanwhile, plans to turn off the part of her brain that knows SoFi as an office so she can join millions of others and just enjoy the “Eras” doc’s fireworks finale./n“l’ll have to watch it a few times, but I will get caught up in the fandom,” she said. “I was there every single night in August, and I was in awe.”/nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

Three of the LP’s singles — “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space” and “Bad Blood” — topped Billboard’s Hot 100, while “Style” and “Wildest Dreams” both peaked inside the Top 10. And her world tour behind the album was a juggernaut known for surprise appearances by a wide array of celebrities including the Weeknd, Mick Jagger, Justin Timberlake, Selena Gomez, Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler, Miranda Lambert, Ricky Martin and the late  Lakers star Kobe Bryant, who presented Swift with a banner at Staples Center marking her 16 sold-out shows at the downtown arena./nNearly a decade later, though, Swift’s pop-cultural dominance has only grown: First revealed near the end of her sold-out six-show run at Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium, “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” follows the first leg of her record-breaking Eras tour and an accompanying concert film currently in its second week as the biggest movie in America. It also arrives amid her endlessly scrutinized relationship with Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs and just as her song “Cruel Summer” reached No. 1 four long years after it came out on 2019’s “Lover.”/n Movies /nThe pop phenomenon’s concert film is an occasion for screaming, singing and dancing in the aisles. It also reveals an evolving Taylor Swift, exuding confidence./nOct. 12, 2023/nGiven that each of Swift’s rerecorded albums — “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” “Red (Taylor’s Version)” and “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” — has debuted with successively higher sales-and-streaming numbers, it’s reasonable to wonder whether “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” will make the biggest splash yet — and just before the Nov. 10 announcement of Grammy nominations in which her latest set of new songs, last year’s “Midnights,” is widely expected to prevail./nLike the earlier Taylor’s Versions, the new “1989” comes with freshly recorded tracks from Swift’s so-called vault meant to entice consumers and bolster the singer’s ever-expanding lore. Here are the five vault tracks from “1989,” ranked in order from worst to best:/n5. “Slut!”/nThis month, live music’s other champion of 2023, Beyoncé, helped Swift drum up attention for the “Eras Tour” movie when she showed up for a pair-of-queens photo opp at the film’s premiere at the Grove. But if Tay and Bey have yet to formally collaborate on a song, this bleary synth-pop track about a risky romance suggests that Swift has been paying close attention to Beyoncé for years: “If I’m gonna be drunk, might as well be drunk in love,” Swift sings, quoting the lead single from Beyoncé’s self-titled 2013 LP. Strong concept, so-so execution./n4. “Is It Over Now?”/n“I think of jumping off of very tall somethings,” Swift sings in this vivid account of a relationship doomed to failure — one for which she takes some blame but without enough of the self-flagellating wit that distinguishes “Anti-Hero,” her big hit from “Midnights.” Most quotable lyric: “Your new girl is my clone.”/n3. “Say Don’t Go”/nOne of Swift’s opening acts on the 1989 tour was Haim, the L.A. sister trio who’ve continued to turn up on her albums and at her shows (and on her Instagram). With its booming retro-’80s drums and its shouted backing vocals, this throbbing pop-rock jam — which Swift co-wrote with the great Diane Warren — sounds like an outtake from Haim’s 2013 debut, “Days Are Gone.”/n2. “Now That We Don’t Talk”/nWidespread speculation about Swift’s star-studded dating life kicked into high gear with 2010’s “Speak Now,” which contains what might be the finest breakup song in her catalog in the lacerating (and precisely John Mayer-approximating) “Dear John.” But the people need to know whom she’s referring to in this hilarious take-down of a dude she’s elated to have kicked to the curb: “I don’t have to pretend I like acid rock / Or that I like to be on a mega-yacht / With important men who think important thoughts.”/n1. “Suburban Legends”/nWith the possible exception of Drake, Taylor Swift is pop’s most effective nurser of past grievances, and here — over a surging arena-disco groove that keeps accumulating emotional weight — she examines a fraught high-school reunion in one indelible image after another. Come for the guy “flush with the currency of cool”; stay for the kiss “that’s gonna screw me up forever.”/nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

This exciting revelation was made during the final U.S. stop on the current leg of her The Eras Tour./nEver since this announcement and the confirmation that the album will drop on October 27, fans have been diving back into the original tracks, streaming them with renewed enthusiasm. Now, one particular song from the album is surging on a significant Billboard chart, reaffirming that fans's love for it remains as strong as it was when it was first introduced./nThis week, Swift's single ""Style"" climbs the ranks on the Streaming Songs chart—a weekly compilation of the most-streamed tracks in the United States. The infectious tune soars from its previous position at No. 50, where it sat last time around, to No. 40, making a notable leap of 10 spots in one go. This newfound prominence marks the song's highest standing in quite some time and indicates a promising future ahead for the beloved track./n""Style"" isn't Swift’s sole representation on the Streaming Songs chart. In fact, she has several of her compositions from various albums gracing the competitive ranking. ""Style"" itself follows behind ""Cruel Summer,"" which holds at its peak position of No. 5, along with ""Anti-Hero"" at No. 23 and ""Karma"" at No. 38. Astonishingly, ""Style"" is not even the only tune from 1989 on the chart either. ""Blank Space"" also makes its presence felt at No. 41, and is also steadily gaining traction./nSince the announcement of Swift's re-recorded version of 1989, the songs from the album have witnessed a huge surge in consumption. This phenomenon has translated into immediate gains on the Spotify charts, with many tracks from the Grammy-winning album experiencing a rejuvenated gain in streaming popularity. Clearly, both ""Style"" and ""Blank Space"" have resonated as favorites among the fans, and this momentum might continue to build in the forthcoming weeks./n""Style"" was selected as the third official single from Swift's original 1989 album. The song was heavily promoted in early 2015 and eventually peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100 chart. Now, with its current resurgence, it's poised to potentially reach new heights, at least on the Streaming Songs tally, where it has thus far peaked just a few spaces above where it sits now./nIf this upward trajectory continues, it might even reappear on the Hot 100 chart, much like ""Blank Space"" has managed to do in the recent weeks./n",0,23,Discography,1

Drake leads the charge among all acts, but lately, Swift has been catching up thanks largely to the success of her many re-recorded albums. Her re-released sets have all produced a number of major wins on the Hot 100, and each year, she tacks on plenty of new smashes./nDrake does the same, but until recently, nobody was making a real play for his record. Now, he’s looking to ensure he remains the top-performing star with the most placements on the competitive list./nWhen For All The Dogs arrives, the songs featured on the title will almost certainly enjoy splashy debuts on the Hot 100.

The track opened and peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100, narrowly missing out on giving Drake another chart-topper. The hip-hop powerhouse hasn’t shared any more music from For All The Dogs since then, but that won’t stop the set from producing more hits once people can stream the title en masse./nOver on the Billboard 200, the two artists are much closer to one another. The stars are currently tied with one another for the third-most No. 1 titles, with 12 apiece. Drake will pull ahead in a few weeks with For All The Dogs, but his win might be short-lived.

30,Wesley Morris,Taylor Swift ‘Eras Tour’ Movie Review: Look What We Made Her Do,"Swift’s cultural phenomenon arrives on the big screen with lots of little revelations, along with some what-could-have-beens.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/movies/taylor-swift-eras-movie-review.html,The New York Times,entertainment,us,2023-10-13T21:12:27+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,30,"Advertisement/nSupported by/nSwift’s cultural phenomenon arrives on the big screen with lots of little revelations, along with some what-could-have-beens./nBy Wesley Morris/nWhen you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission./nWe could talk, I suppose, about all Taylor Swift’s done for the economy, friendship bracelets, seismology and Travis Kelce. But her greatest nonmusical achievement is the innocuous art she’s made of the gape. On a 50-foot screen, the various apertures of her mouth constitute a spectacle. There’s the “Who? Me?,” the “yeah I said it,” the “ouch,” the “ooooo,” the “gosh golly” and the “Sally Field wins another Oscar.” Hers is the story of “oh.”/nThat glee is a reason to be happy about the movie that’s been assembled from her live show — “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which was shot at SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles, the final stop on the tour’s first leg. “Happy” because it’s recorded what a gladdening agent Swift can be on a stage and the stamina summoned to power that agency for the better part of three hours. The movie’s about 165 minutes long, and she’s as ebullient descending into the stage, for her farewell, as she is in the opening minutes magically materializing upon it. The first words she speaks to the 70,000 people hooting for her are, “Oh, hi!,” as if SoFi were a shower we’d caught her singing in./nIn June, when Swift landed at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the pushing and screaming — by five high schoolers — to my immediate rear ceased at about the two-hour mark. I turned to check on the state of their ecstasy and found a pile of fatigue — the human version of that crumpled face emoji. Her glee had outlasted theirs, her zing had them zung. If nothing else, this movie’s a monument to that: Swift’s illusion of ease. She doesn’t work as physically hard or as loosely or hydraulically as her dancers. She’s not a Jackson. And she doesn’t sing as enormously or as exquisitely as a Streisand, Carey, Dion or Knowles-Carter. Nor is her show — produced as discrete segments devoted to nine of Swift’s 10 albums — the cultural gymnasium Madonna requires. Swift plays to her enhanced strengths: candied pitch, arresting stature, toothsome songwriting, winking, the very idea of play. Not far into things, right around “Cruel Summer,” she announces that we’ve encountered “the very first bridge of the evening.” There are more to come, because not since Lionel Richie has a major pop star so enjoyed the pleasure in the might of her bridgecraft./nIt wasn’t until this movie that Swift’s 10-minute breakup ballad “All Too Well,” which she performs alone downstage in a glittering robe and an acoustic guitar, struck me as an achievement of genuine theater. Rapt in a movie theater, I felt the song’s heart-wrung pique in a new way. Some of that comes from watching Swift’s face register the ache, tsking recrimination. The rest comes from the song pooling outward into anthem territory. Live, it’s like watching someone woodwork “American Pie” until it resembles “Purple Rain.”/n“Eras” is studded with little revelations like that. Another: the “Reputation” section of the show contains her freest, most ambitious singing and movement. That album is the first in which she approximates the mischievous, cunning, swaggy music that Beyoncé or Rihanna could make. But the kick of its first six songs is that Swift invites the dare. She spends this part of the show dressed in a serpentine unitard. She knows./nOne more aha: Swift can command a stage. I’d never thought of her as someone a camera has to take in. But anytime she’s in one of those glittering bathing suits and a pair of spangled knee-high boots, the length of her demands in-taking. She can strike a formidable pose. But early, when she points to different spots in SoFi and those sections start to roar, she jokes that that kind of power is “dangerous” before kissing her biceps, except I don’t think she’s joking. She understands her power and she’s skilled at performing the accident of having so much of it, like she can’t also believe how the country would react if she, say, started going to football games and chest-bumping folks and being associated with a thing of nearby chicken fingers. Her embodiment of lightness and blitheness and insouciance constitutes a talent. Another gape: Did I do that?/nThe show confirmed my sense that Swift can’t be serious — doesn’t want to be — for long, lest she be labeled self-serious. She’s fine with attention but less so with her own monumentality. That discomfort strikes me as the source of the Taylor-as-Godzilla imagery of “Anti-Hero,” a dirge in jam’s clothing. In concert, Swift is as committed to skipping like a cartoon first grader along the stage as she is to sashaying and skulking around it. She’d rather be running than standing still, accruing meaning. She’d rather use her body for screwball comedy than for totemism. She knows what a holy object we’ve made and seems to be trying to undercut that. These are thoughts that could occur to you live in the moment of the show itself. But now the camera permits you to savor it./nSo it’s a shame that the shots here are all over the place — the stage, the sky, too close, too far, too kinetic; only occasionally, in medium close-ups, just right. The director is Sam Wrench, and it’s unclear whether he’s making a movie or a salad. Under the circumstances, he’s done the best he probably could. For one thing, his camera operators and editors have to compete with the jumbo monitors that project what’s at the center of the stadium to its farthest reaches. Few movie screens can hold a candle to one of those — the screen at my theater wasn’t one of them, anyway. The projected image delivers a Swift who seems to be in higher resolution than the woman onstage. The breakthroughs in screen imaging have changed the concert-going experience for better and worse. They’ve democratized it, and that’s great./nYou can actually experience Swift more clearly in the upper decks than in the inner circles. The concert screens literalize her cultural magnitude. But they seem like hell on good filmmaking. Unless, no one prioritized attempting to shoot around them so that Swift isn’t being upstaged by herself. Of course, that inner-circle seat is, if not priceless (there was definitely a price tag), then certainly far more valuable since, whenever Swift makes her way to the stage’s lip, we can shove a phone in her face. That introduces a modern eyesore for a concert film: other people’s movies. The “Eras” crew has clearly aimed to keep the amateur films mostly out of the shots. But they’re there, nonetheless, as intrusive in a movie as they are at the show itself./nWhat is it we should expect from a concert movie? Cinema or fax? “Eras” is proof that an event took place and that the event was fun. There’s more it could have been, of course. “More” just opened a few weeks ago — well, reopened in the form of “Stop Making Sense,” the 1984 concert movie Jonathan Demme made from a few Talking Heads shows, also in Los Angeles. The film predates the camera phone but not the audience. You barely hear one, and he rarely cuts away to it. The film captures one man expanding into a family and the family into a kind of small choir. Maybe Swift is too big for that movie’s living-room approach. But surely there’s a more imaginative strategy to bring her to us than point-and-shoot./nI know. “Eras” wasn’t made to be art. It was made to be an index of art that got made. It was made for posterity. Oh — and for the hundreds of people in the parking lot at every Eras show who could sort of hear Swift and had to make do with seeing only each other. The movie is for them.

One commenter said it’s suspicious that Conway follows just 22 accounts, referring to Swift’s song, 22. “If you’re Taylor Swift blink twice,” another wrote. Some admitted, though, that Swift really might have nothing to do with the movie. “Imagine this isn't Taylor and she is just reading the comments so confused,” one commenter said./nConway wrote on Instagram she is an “introvert” and only recently began posting on social media because she was told to for film promotional purposes./nSwift has long been known for teasing her fans with hints and clues about future projects, in some cases directly challenging them to unlock her secrets. Earlier in her career, Swift hid decipherable messages for fans in her CD booklets by capitalizing random letters. In 2017, she said the “whole video” for “Look What You Made Me Do” is an Easter egg, and she hid the titles of future singles in the video for 2019’s “ME!” For her re-recorded albums, which contain previously unreleased songs, Swift challenges fans to unscramble song titles. Swift’s history of dropping Easter eggs has caused her fans to develop wild theories about her every move, but the singer has admitted she “trained them to be that way.” Swift is also no stranger to pen names: She co-wrote Calvin Harris and Rihanna’s hit “This Is What You Came For” under the pen name Nils Sjöberg, and her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn has writing credits on several of her songs under the name William Bowery./nThe Hollywood Reporter attempted to contact Conway and receive an advance copy of the novel last year, both of which were unsuccessful.

As the tune continues its ascent, Swift finds herself in the company of some legendary artists, matching one in particular for the first time./nThis week, “Cruel Summer” soars to new heights, landing in the No. 4 spot on the Hot 100. Just last week, the song had been at No. 6, so it enters the top five on the ranking of the most-consumed tunes in the U.S. for the first time./nNow that “Cruel Summer” has become Swift’s latest top five smash on the Hot 100, the singer ties with Mariah Carey for the second-most placements in the region among women. The two powerhouses have both sent 27 tracks into the arena, according to Billboard./nThe only woman who has scored more top fives on the Hot 100 is Madonna, and she’s not ahead by much. Swift and Carey are just one win behind the Queen of Pop at the moment./nSwift and Carey's impressive record places them side-by-side in fourth place among all artists with the most top five hits on the Hot 100. Drake stands ahead of everyone else with a remarkable 36 appearances in the top five. In an interesting twist, Swift's rise is mirrored by Drake's continued success, as he and Travis Scott's latest single, ""Meltdown,"" makes its debut at No. 3 on this week's chart, so he ups his count as well./nThe Beatles hold the second spot among artists with the most top five hits on the Hot 100. They managed to send 29 songs into the upper echelons of the chart, with most of them reaching the coveted No. 1 position./nLooking ahead, Swift's trajectory appears clear, and it’s only a matter of time before this ranking changes again. As she inches closer to Madonna's record, the possibility of Swift tying, and then passing, the superstar seem likely. She will also almost surely match and then beat The Beatles as well./nThat said, whether or not she can catch up to Drake is unclear. While names like Carey, Madonna and The Beatles haven’t added another top five hit in quite some time, Drake regularly sends songs toward the top of the tally, and he and Swift are now in a race against one another./n",0,37,Achievements,1

Since no train actually stops at SoFi, two free shuttles took passengers directly to the concert venue from a train station. One ran from the K (Crenshaw) Line’s Downtown Inglewood Station. The other ran from the C Line’s Hawthorne/Lennox Station. The shuttles will run 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. before each show, and for 90 minutes after the concerts./nBut the two shuttles were not full Thursday and the line to get on board the K Line at the Downtown Inglewood Station was nearly empty around 5 p.m., as extra accommodations went unneeded./nRows of security tape forming snaking lines before the shuttles became merely decorative as buses came and went with space inside to spare.

The couple had reserved a space there ahead of time./nWhile the train connections were a bit like alphabet soup, she is a veteran Metro user and felt confident she could find her way. “I am taking the A Line,” she said, pausing for several seconds, “to the God I don’t even know I think the Expo Line, then to the K Line, then to the shuttle that will get us to SoFi.”/nFor many Swifties, the concert is just part of the night out.

The song was never released as a single during the initial Lover promotional cycle—instead, ME! (feat. Brendan Urie) was released as its lead single, receiving some negative reviews (it didn’t make the cut for the “Eras Tour” setlist). The other songs then promoted as singles were “Lover,” “You Need To Calm Down” and “The Man.” “Cruel Summer” was met with praise from critics and fans upon its release: In 2019, the Los Angeles Times named it the best song on Lover. Some praise specifically highlighted the catchy bridge, where Swift’s voice rises to a shout, which has become a fan-favorite moment at the “Eras Tour.” Prior to promoting “Cruel Summer,” Swift had pushed “Karma,” from her 2022 album Midnights, as a single, complete with a remix featuring rapper Ice Spice released in May, and though the song peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100, it lags far behind “Cruel Summer” in daily streams./n“The weirdest, most magical thing is happening,” Swift said at a June “Eras Tour” stop, announcing “Cruel Summer” as her next single. “‘Cruel Summer’ was on the Lover album. That album came out four years ago. And I just need to let you know something. ‘Cruel Summer,’ that song was my pride and joy on that album. You have conversations before the album comes out. Everybody around weighs in on what they think should be singles. I was finally, finally about to have my favorite song become the single off of Lover, and I’m not trying to blame the global pandemic that we had, but that is something that happened that stopped Cruel Summer from ever being a single.”/n1,239,311,929. That’s how many Spotify streams “Cruel Summer” currently has, making it the most streamed song on Lover—surpassing all the songs promoted as singles four years ago. It’s Swift’s third most streamed song on Spotify, ranking ahead of some of her signature hits, like “Shake It Off” and “Style.”/n“Cruel Summer” isn’t Swift’s only years-old song to surge in popularity. Thanks to her re-recording project, updated versions of her back catalog have taken over the charts, most notably a ten-minute version of her 2012 song, “All Too Well.” The extended version of the track (subtitled “Taylor’s Version,” like all of her re-recorded songs) hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 thanks to an extensive marketing push and fan hype. The song, considered by some critics her finest work, was released in November 2021 alongside a short film starring Dylan O’Brien and Sadie Sink, a live performance on Saturday Night Live and several late night talk show appearances. All of her re-recorded albums released thus far—Fearless, Red and Speak Now—have topped the Billboard 200 albums chart.

The Hot 100 is a list of the most-consumed songs in the U.S., and his single “I Remember Everything” with Kacey Musgraves launches ahead of every other title./nIt’s not odd for a popular musician to claim the No. 1 spot on either the Hot 100 or Billboard 200, or even both at the same time, but Bryan’s titles debut in the same space…at the same time. This is relatively uncommon, and only a handful of artists have managed this specific showing. In fact, Billboard reports that this has only happened nine times in history, and Bryan is just the fifth act to do so./nAs he debuts at No. 1 on both the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 simultaneously, Bryan joins the likes of Taylor Swift, BTS, Drake, and Future in this showing. Swift was the first to do so, and she made history back in 2020 when her album Folklore and its lead single “Cardigan” launched in first place on their respective charts. Amazingly, the pop and country superstar has gone on to replicate this showing three more times, accounting for about half of all instances of this feat taking place./nDrake is the only other artist aside from Swift to debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 at the same time more than once. He did so in 2021 with his album Certified Lover Boy and its single “Way 2 Sexy” with Future and Young Thug. He then managed to do so again the following year with Honestly, Nevermind and its biggest hit, “Jimmy Cooks” with 21 Savage./nBTS was the second act to follow Swift, and they scored a No. 1 on both charts in 2020 with their short album Be and its single “Life Goes On.” Future is also a member of this club, as his album I Never Liked You launched at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2022, as did the song “Wait For U” with Tems and Drake./n",1.162414685,41,Unrelated,1

Be that as it may, body language is crucial to how the three-hour-plus performance works./nOn Friday, at the second of six Los Angeles concerts, the most significant gesture came early, between songs. Basking in the deafening roar of 70,000 fans, Swift struck a coy “Who, me?” pose and said she wanted to try something. She pointed at a section of SoFi Stadium, and the cheering from that section somehow got louder./n“I feel so powerful,” she said, kissing a bicep. But the power she was flexing wasn’t muscular. It was her ability — with the magnification of giant video screens — to connect with every member of the crowd. The choreography helped keep that connection a live wire./nI don’t just mean the dance numbers, though there are plenty of those, choreographed by Mandy Moore (“La La Land,” “So You Think You Can Dance?”). The backup dancers sometimes contributed to the spectacle. They handled the billowing floral parachutes that concealed and revealed Swift at the start. They wielded glowing orbs during “Willow,” clouds on ladders during “Lavender Haze,” umbrellas during “Midnight Rain.” Not especially imaginative, this was all just something big enough to see./nElsewhere, the dancers helped suggest the situations of the songs. The bicep kiss was a segue to “The Man,” a complaint about gender double standards that was staged as an ascent up the stairs and levels of an office set populated by chest-thumping workers. In other songs, a few dancers played roles: the boyfriend that Swift berates for emotional neglect across (and atop) a long dinner table in “Tolerate It,” or the scandalizing socialite protagonist of “The Last Great American Dynasty.”/nBut really, the concert has only one character, Swift. In “Look What You Made Me Do,” the dancers were costumed as earlier versions of her, trapped in transparent boxes like dolls. Mostly, though, they served as a friend group or party guests. A happy, diverse bunch, they did a little ballroom dancing to evoke the romantic fantasy of “Lover,” a little vogueing to give “Bejeweled” some shimmer./nAnd then they left. Which is to say, they left the audience alone with Swift, again and again, re-establishing the thrill of mass intimacy. Other pop stars use this effect, but it’s especially potent with Swift because she’s also a singer-songwriter, who can sit at a piano or tap into the iconography of a guitar-slinging truth teller./nThe most intense moments of the show were in this mode: the 10-minute extended version of “All Too Well” and the acoustic mini-set of “secret songs” that differ from night to night. This is almost pointedly not dancing, but it requires a particular physicality at which Swift excels. She has the wide stance, both confident and confiding. She looks grounded, comfortable, at home./nThat’s generally true when she isn’t dancing. She can strut or skip around the huge catwalk and stage that extend across the stadium floor without looking small. She can strike over-the-shoulder poses for the camera. She can inhabit her many sparkly costumes — rolling her hips in fringe dresses and Louboutin boots, using the flowy sleeves on her “Folklore” dress the way Stevie Nicks uses scarves./nSo does it matter that in the cafe chair burlesque routine for “Vigilante ___,” a homage to louche Bob Fosse dances, she’s imprecise and physically uncommitted to the pleasures and dangers of sex? (She caresses her body like she’s afraid to.) It doesn’t, because her fans love her anyway. And it does, because this imperfect dancing is, I think, part of her nonthreatening Everywoman image. It makes her easier to identify with./nAnd that is what the whole concert is about, the identification between Swift and the fans she continually thanks and flatters, the fans who know every word to every song. Swift told the L.A. crowd that when those fans sing her lyrics along with her, she takes that as a sign that they too have felt what she felt./nIt makes sense, then, that she moves the way anyone might move. So that anyone might imagine being her — just pointing and feeling powerful./nAdvertisement",-13.32946746,43,Tour,0

(Photo by Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift continues to control the Billboard 200 this week with her latest release, 1989 (Taylor’s Version). The set debuted atop the ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. last time around with more than 1.6 million equivalent units shifted—the largest start of her career. Now, it’s a non-mover at No. 1 with more than 200,000 more units moved./nAs fans continue to buy and stream 1989 (Taylor’s Version) in huge enough numbers to keep it at No. 1 in America, it’s not as if her older albums are done with. In fact, one of her early re-recordings is still going strong, and this frame it reaches a special milestone./nRed (Taylor’s Version) has now lived on the Billboard 200 for 104 weeks, or exactly two years. This frame, the title slips slightly, dipping from No. 23 to No. 25./nAccording to data shared by Luminate, Red (Taylor’s Version) moved another 25,000 equivalent units this week. That sum includes 6,500 pure purchases—a very strong number for a title that’s been out in the world for at least two years./nRed (Taylor’s Version) served as the second re-recording Swift released in her effort to rework her first six albums as a way to regain control over the masters in a clever manner. The set opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in November 2021 with 605,000 equivalent units moved. It marked her tenth trip to the summit at the time, but since then, she’s scored several more winners./nThe title is one of Swift’s 10 that is currently present on the Billboard 200. Amazingly, even though it’s still sitting as high as No. 25 on the chart, it’s only her seventh-highest-ranking of the bunch. Red (Taylor’s Version) is the singer’s eleventh title to spend at least two years on the Billboard 200, with many holding on for much, much longer./n",1.425907635,44,Achievements,1

They had heard rumors that Taylor Swift might be coming to Buenos Aires, and they wanted to be first in line./nThe rumors were right: Ms. Swift was coming, but it would take a while. Her concert was more than five months away./nThe tent stayed anyway, occupied by a rotating cast of 30 die-hard Swifties who worked together over 163 days to hold their spots in line for a chance to get as close as possible to their idol when she walked onstage Thursday in the first stop of her Eras Tour outside North America./n“We have been waiting for this for many years,” said Ms. Romeo, 23, who quit her job as a cashier partly to dedicate herself to waiting in line. “We didn’t expect her to come, and then she did. So it was obvious that we had to do what we had to do.”/nMs. Swift’s Eras Tour officially went global on Thursday when the pop megastar began a new phase of shows that would take her to 25 cities across South America, Asia, Australia and Europe over the next 10 months./nSince March, the North American stretch of the tour has become an economic marvel and a cultural force, cementing Ms. Swift’s status as one of the most influential, and beloved, people on the continent. Now, she is set to demonstrate that her fame and adoration go well beyond borders./nThere are few countries better to display the intense passion of her fans than Argentina. While Ms. Swift has become a certified global icon, Argentina has become known for worshiping icons with religious fervor./nConsider that Juan and Eva Perón became Argentina’s president and first lady in 1946 but are still lionized in political chants, are displayed in portraits in many Argentine homes and are the inspiration for a namesake political movement that still runs the country. Diego Maradona, the soccer star, became seen as such a deity here that tens of thousands of Argentines belong to the, yes, Church of Maradona, a legally recognized religion in its 25th year. And after Lionel Messi and the national soccer team won the World Cup last year, the crush of four million adoring fans during the victory parade forced the players to abandon their buses and fly over in a helicopter instead./n“She’s like the female Messi,” said Ms. Romeo, offering Ms. Swift about the highest praise an Argentine could nowadays. Some fans in Buenos Aires this week wore jerseys of the national soccer team with “SWIFT” on the back, while others passed out a sort of prayer card with Ms. Swift’s head superimposed over Jesus Christ’s./nSo it was no surprise that Ms. Swift’s arrival in Argentina became a national event. It received intense news coverage; Buenos Aires named her an official guest of honor; and she became a figure in next week’s presidential election after some of her fans organized against the far-right candidate, Javier Milei. Meteorologists even described forecasts for sun or rain this weekend as “dry Swifties” or “wet Swifties.” (Friday called for “wet Swifties,” so organizers rescheduled that show for Sunday.)/n“Everyone in the country knows her, and everyone knows about this show,” Renata Schyfys, 15, said at the show on Thursday, wearing at least six inches of friendship bracelets, which have become a badge of Swiftie fandom./nIn a country of 46 million people, Ms. Swift sold roughly 200,000 tickets across three sold-out shows, and yet the waiting list still had more than 2.8 million people — enough to fill Argentina’s biggest soccer arena, El Monumental, another 40 times./nThat stadium was shaking on Thursday night with near-constant, ear-piercing screams coming from the more than 70,000 fans there who repeatedly chanted, “Olé, olé, olé, olé, Taylor, Taylor.”/nEven Ms. Swift, who has seen her share of huge crowds, seemed taken aback. “I am looking out to possibly what might be one of the most epic crowds to ever exist,” she told the audience. “This is on another level.”/nLater, she removed her earpieces and motioned that she was struggling to hear over the roar of the crowd. She paused for a full two minutes, soaking in her fans’ adoration./n“I don’t know how to thank you enough for the way you’re treating me tonight,” she said. “I love you so, so much, and I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to come see you.”/nThe show on Thursday was Ms. Swift’s first major concert in South America, the first of nine this month in Argentina and Brazil. After waiting for so long, many Swifties on Thursday said they had made a sort of pilgrimage, many from across the continent./nNahuel Ochoa, a medical student wearing a homemade bedazzled jumpsuit and a glittery jacket, had taken a bus with 50 other fans from the city of San Luis, 12 hours away. Unable to get a room in Buenos Aires, where hotels were nearly sold out, he was planning to take the bus back after the show — and then return on Saturday to see Ms. Swift again./n“We have loved Taylor since we were 10 years old — we have been waiting 13 years,” Mr. Ochoa, 23, said, sitting alongside his childhood friend Andrea Garro. “Her songs reflect the majority of what we go through. It’s a form of expressing ourselves in a way that we can’t.”/nMs. Garro, 23, a law student, added that Ms. Swift’s music helped her get past a deep depression. “We feel seen,” she said./nBut there was no show of devotion greater than the more than 100 fans who camped out in shifts outside the stadium for months. After Ms. Romeo and her friends staked out their spot and attracted local news attention, other tents followed./nThe group of mostly young women set up shifts using a spreadsheet, with ideally at least two people present at the tent at all times. The 30 members of Ms. Romeo’s tent had to spend a minimum of 40 hours there a month, with each member spending about 10 to 12 nights at the tent on average. After spending the first few days sleeping with just blankets, they added a mattress./n“She has the best relationship with her fans and is the one that can achieve this sort of mania,” said Lucas Forte, 24, a member of another tent who had slept outside the stadium for five nights since September. “No one camped out for the Weeknd, for example.”/nMs. Swift herself was impressed with the effort. “I heard you guys were camping out to get good spots?” she asked the crowd on Thursday. “I actually didn’t believe it until I saw a video.”/nThe fans camping out were not holding a place to get tickets to the show. Those were all sold online. Rather, the tents were set up so they could be first in line when the doors to the show opened and the fans could sprint to the guardrails along the stage for a closer view./nEvent organizers helped make sure the fans who had camped out were first in line — yet many still ended up behind rows of people whose pricier tickets had allowed them to enter even earlier./nBut some campers eventually reached the barricade along the stage./n“I smashed my knee trying to get there,” said Atenas Astuni, 23, a member of the first-in-line tent, her voice hoarse the Friday morning after the show. “But if I had to smash my knee again to repeat exactly what happened yesterday, I would do it without hesitation.”/nJack Nicas is the Brazil bureau chief, covering Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.

The Jets were flailing after their 39-year-old would-be savior tore his Achilles’ tendon minutes into the season./nBut many millions of people tuned in anyway: America’s most breathlessly covered situationship — between Kansas City’s All-Pro tight end, Travis Kelce, and pop music’s biggest star, Taylor Swift — was playing out on prime-time television./n“They are two of the biggest media entertainment entities,” said Nora Princiotti, a football writer for The Ringer who also co-hosts a popular music podcast that often focuses on Swift./nThe game was surprisingly competitive, with the Chiefs narrowly beating the Jets, 23-20. And the telecast also offered a spectacular collision of the nation’s most-watched prime-time show and the ardent fans of a pop star at the height of her powers./nMaria Taylor, the host of NBC’s pregame show on Sunday night, opened her monologue with an unsubtle nod to a Swift song, “Enchanted.” Over the next hour, anchors called attention to a Swift look-alike, and cameras showed fans wearing Swift T-shirts./nThe network also featured a collage of photos of Swift at last week’s Chiefs-Bears game, and around 7:42 p.m., cameras showed Swift herself at MetLife Stadium./nAbout 10 minutes later, NBC aired a mash-up of TikTok videos, photos and scenes from Kelce’s podcast, unspooling football story lines as well as the week’s celebrity buzz. Then the “Sunday Night Football” broadcast officially began with mentions of Jets and Chiefs players preparing to take the field./n“Oh, and yeah, she’s here: Taylor is in the house,” the play-by-play announcer Mike Tirico said while NBC showed Swift hugging someone in a luxury suite. Tirico then added, “Hi Swifties, we’ll be with you all night.”/nGiven Swift’s mega-fame and penchant for writing songs about her romantic relationships, her dating life has long been a subject of scrutiny. But the frenzied curiosity of the past week was rare even for Swift./nFox Sports said the Chiefs-Bears game that Swift attended was the week’s most-watched telecast on any network, with 24.3 million viewers powered in part by a strong female audience. Fox cameras frequently panned to her reactions after Kelce, the game’s leading receiver, touched the ball./nOn Sunday, NBC showed Swift several times but focused primarily on the football game. Network officials had said it was important to satisfy its regular audience, even though they knew that some viewers would be mostly interested in the 12-time Grammy winner./n“We’re aware we could be reaching new eyeballs,” Rob Hyland, the coordinating producer of “Sunday Night Football,” said on Friday./nJust before Sunday night’s game began, NBC ran yet another teaser for the contest — this one narrated by the television host Carson Daly — explaining the stakes of the football matchup with at least a half-dozen call-outs to titles of Swift songs./nWhen the Chiefs quickly scored a touchdown in the first quarter, the cameras turned to Swift’s celebration, even though Kelce was not involved with the play. During the commercial break that followed, NBC aired, for a second time, a high-gloss commercial for Swift’s Eras Tour concert movie that hits theaters this month./nLater in the evening, NBC showed a “Cornelia St.” sign in Manhattan (Swift wrote a song about the street); Donna Kelce, the tight end’s mother, got more screen time with Swift; and Melissa Stark gave a sideline report about the spike in Kelce jersey sales./nThe Chiefs and a publicist for Swift did not respond to a request for comment./nBut with Swift’s Eras Tour briefly on pause, her concert movie forthcoming and Kelce’s commitment to his football podcast as his Hall of Fame-caliber career wanes, a supercharged dose of crossover publicity on national television was probably a welcome boost, even for the already famous./nKelce led the Chiefs with six receptions but had a quiet night by his standards.

Until then there’s her 2018 performance at Coachella. It was the stuff of legends. Marching bands! A Destiny’s Child reunion! So when “Homecoming” dropped on Netflix the next year, it truly felt like a gift. The film is one of intriguing contradictions, feeling both intimate and outsize at once. You see the painstaking hard work in every stunning piece of choreography and hear it in every breathtaking vocal, yet Queen Bey makes it look effortless. Mekado Murphy/nIn theaters/nWhat elevates “Stop Making Sense” — and what has made its recent 40th anniversary rerelease now in theaters such a sensation — is its formal elegance. David Byrne begins alone onstage with a tape player and, as fellow musicians gradually accrue with each song, ends as the large-suited ringleader of a rock ’n’ roll circus. The director Jonathan Demme knows he doesn’t need spectacle or special effects to transfix: He just allows each frame to fill with the charisma of a great band. Lindsay Zoladz/nAvailable to stream on Disney+ and Hulu/nIf 1970’s “Woodstock” is one of the defining concert documentaries, “Summer of Soul,” released in 2021, acts as a sort of complement and rejoinder to it. Questlove’s Oscar-winning film exuberantly unearths footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival — which took place the same summer as Woodstock — and cuts together some of the most extraordinary performances from artists like Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Gladys Knight, Nina Simone and so many more. Questlove includes interviews with participants and attendees that contextualize the sets musically and historically, but the film’s power is the ability to make you feel as if you are in the crowd even if you are just sitting on your couch. Esther Zuckerman/nAvailable to stream on Max/nThis 1970 documentary directed by the Maysles brothers and Charlotte Zwerin is known as something of a Zapruder film for the death of the ’60s, with its footage of a killing at the Rolling Stones’ free concert at Altamont Speedway a year earlier. Still, the movie’s great music gets across the promise that was lost: Mick Jagger in an Uncle Sam top hat and a long lavender scarf, hip-thrusting his way through “Jumpin’ Jack Flash.” The Flying Burrito Brothers raving up “Six Days on the Road” when it still seemed like Altamont could be “the greatest party of 1969.” And most explosively, Tina Turner, singing “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long” and giving a microphone the time of its life. David Renard/nAvailable to stream or rent on major platforms/nThe Music for the Masses tour brought the British synth band’s yearning songs — reverberating like confessional hymns in a cathedral — to the Rose Bowl and beyond in 1987-88. “Depeche Mode: 101” takes in the smokily lighted shows (with lead singer Dave Gahan in a billowing white shirt) and the bright-eyed “bus kids,” fans who went along for the ride. D.A. Pennebaker tunes into the heartbeat of Depeche Mode’s electronic sound, co-directing with Chris Hegedus and David Dawkins. Nicolas Rapold/nAvailable to rent or buy on most major platforms./nI would wager this is the only concert film, directed by Joe DeMaio, that periodically cuts away from the performance to show documentary segments about the Zapatistas, the rebel political group of southern Mexico. Tonally, it’s a turn-of-the-century time capsule: The frenetic live footage (recorded in 1999 and released in 2001) seems to have been edited by a can of Red Bull. But the band’s knockout blend of overt leftist ideology and inventive, funky rap-over-metal holds up. Look for the guitarist Tom Morello’s rhythmic tapping of the unplugged tip of his guitar cable to make music, like somebody using the board game Operation as an instrument. Gabe Cohn/nAvailable to stream on the Criterion Channel/nMichael Rapaport’s documentary about the groundbreaking rap group A Tribe Called Quest isn’t exactly a concert film per se, but it is bookended by a pair of critical tours: a 2008 run that rapper Q-Tip bitterly declares backstage is its last performance ever, and another in 2010 that sees the trio cautiously reuniting. In between is a vibrant tribute, particularly enhanced after Phife Dawg’s death in 2016, and a no-frills look at the story of a singular group that changed hip-hop, even as success distanced them from one another. Brandon Yu/nAvailable to rent or buy on most major platforms/nIf Shakira’s recent performance at the MTV Video Music Awards impressed you, this 2011 release will floor you. Singing in three languages (often while dancing vigorously) and playing multiple instruments, the Colombian megastar commands the stage with a magnetic intensity. There isn’t much artifice on display here, only Shakira surrendering her entire body to the vitality of her genre-defying, globally inspired music. Take as proof her sensational belly dancing during “Ojos Así” or her transition from tenderness to fury in the rock ballad “Inevitable.” Carlos Aguilar/nAdvertisement",1.483056428,52,Unrelated,0

54,Brooks Barnes,One Question for Taylor Swift’s Eras Concert Film: How Big Will It Be?,"The pop star’s concert film, arriving in theaters on Friday, is expected to break box office records. “The fever and scale is unprecedented,” one analyst said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/business/media/taylor-swift-movie.html,The New York Times,entertainment,us,2023-10-11T09:02:09+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,54,"Advertisement/nSupported by/nThe pop star’s concert film, arriving in theaters on Friday, is expected to break box office records. “The fever and scale is unprecedented,” one analyst said./nBy Brooks Barnes/nReporting from Los Angeles/nThe world’s biggest pop star, Taylor Swift, is about to become the world’s biggest movie star, at least for a weekend. The only question is whether turnout for her concert film will be enormous or truly colossal./nBox office analysts keep raising opening-weekend estimates for “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which will arrive in cinemas on Friday evening amid a lightning storm of free publicity. (As you may have heard, Ms. Swift has lately been spending considerable time with Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end.) The nearly three-hour film was initially expected to sell about $75 million in tickets this weekend in the United States and Canada, with analysts reaching that estimate by studying presales and moviegoer surveys. As of Tuesday, the domestic number was looking more like $125 million./nCould it reach $150 million? “Yes, it could,” said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. “The fever and scale is unprecedented.”/n“The Eras Tour,” which cost Ms. Swift roughly $15 million to make, is expected to collect an additional $60 million overseas — at a minimum — over the weekend./n“We are wonder-struck,” said Wanda Gierhart Fearing, chief marketing and content officer for the Cinemark theater chain, which has a large presence in the southern United States and Latin America. In addition to standard screenings, Cinemark and other multiplex operators have been offering private viewing parties. (That’s $800 for 40 people. Dancing encouraged, but not on seats.)/nThe domestic box office record for a concert film debut is held by “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,” which Paramount Pictures released in 2011. It collected $41 million over its first three days in North American theaters, adjusted for inflation, and ultimately $101 million in the United States and Canada and $138 million worldwide./n“Michael Jackson’s This Is It,” released by Sony Pictures in 2009, holds the record for total ticket sales. It generated $105 million over its entire North American run, and $380 million worldwide, adjusted for inflation./nBox office analysts aren’t quite sure what to expect from “The Eras Tour,” in part because it comes only nine weeks after Ms. Swift concluded the six-month, 53-show initial leg of her sold-out North American tour. The trade publication Pollstar estimated that she had sold about $14 million in tickets each night./nHas the thirst for Ms. Swift among casual fans been satisfied for the time being? To what degree did the cultural frenzy surrounding her Eras concerts pique the curiosity of a broader audience — people who would never pay hundreds of dollars to see her perform in a stadium but might shell out for movie tickets? (Most seats for the film cost $19.89, a nod to the name of Ms. Swift’s fifth album and her birth year.)/nComplicating predictions, Ms. Swift broke Hollywood norms in getting her film to theaters./nUnder the customary model, studios book movies into theaters and spend anywhere from $20 million to $100 million on marketing to turn out an audience. Theaters play movies and sell concessions. In return, studios collect as much as 70 percent of opening-weekend tickets sales, with theaters keeping the balance./nSince she produced and financed “The Eras Tour” herself, Ms. Swift cut out the middle company (a studio) and made a distribution deal directly with AMC Entertainment, the world’s largest theater operator. One reason involved marketing: Ms. Swift, with 369 million social media followers at her beck and call, barely needs to spend anything to advertise the film./nMs. Swift will keep about 57 percent of ticket revenue, with theater chains pocketing the rest, as first reported by a Puck newsletter. AMC will also receive a modest distribution fee./nBox office forecasting, however, is based on moviegoer surveys that are designed to track the effectiveness of studio marketing campaigns — older women are not being persuaded by your ads, for example, but teenage boys are in the bag. “The Eras Tour” has had some paid advertising, including a commercial during a Chiefs prime-time game this month. But most movies arrive amid an advertising bombardment./n“One of the questions involves staying power,” said Bruce Nash, founder of the Numbers, a box office tracking and analytics site. “Is ‘The Eras Tour’ going to do most of its business on opening weekend and then fall off a cliff? Or will people come back six times over the course of weeks? We have no idea.”/nMs. Swift’s distribution choice made Hollywood gnash its teeth. Studio executives had to explain to their bosses why they missed a prime moneymaking opportunity and a chance to form a relationship with Ms. Swift, who has feature film directing ambitions. (She has also tinkered with acting, including in “Cats.”) Universal Pictures, fearing competition from “The Eras Tour,” scrambled to move “The Exorcist: Believer” to an earlier date; ticket sales were soft./nStudios have also had to contend with an existential question: Does distribution for “The Eras Tour” mark the start of a paradigm shift? Are more movies going to bypass studios? Already, Beyoncé has followed Ms. Swift in making a deal with AMC to distribute her concert documentary, “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” which will arrive in theaters on Dec. 1./nAnything is possible. Mr. Nash noted that Fathom Events, an independent distributor that specializes in short-run screenings and simulcast opera performances, has found increasing success in taking faith-based projects (“The Chosen”) directly to theaters. Trafalgar Releasing found a studio-skipping hit in February with a concert film focused on BTS, the South Korean boy band./nBut most studio executives and entertainment industry analysts dismiss “The Eras Tour” as a one-off. When it comes to mobilizing a fan base, Ms. Swift, they say, is in a class by herself. Even Beyoncé has not shown the same selling power. First-day presales for “The Eras Tour” totaled an estimated $37 million, while “Renaissance” generated about $7 million./nAt the moment, theater chains aren’t thinking much beyond the weekend. The last two months have been quiet for theaters, with hits like “The Nun II” (Warner Bros.) offset by a string of duds, including “Dumb Money,” “Blue Beetle,” “The Creator” and “Expend4bles.”/nTwo major movies originally expected this fall, “Kraven the Hunter” and “Dune: Part Two,” were pushed into next year because of the actors’ strike. (Until the strike is resolved, SAG-AFTRA, as the actors’ union in known, has barred its members from engaging in any publicity efforts for films and TV shows that have already been completed.)/nTheater companies, of course, make most of their money at the concession counter, and AMC, for one, is counting on Ms. Swift’s fans to come hungry. Among other items, the chain plans to sell popcorn in collectible tubs for $20./nMarketing line: “Swifties always snack in style.”/nBrooks Barnes covers all things Hollywood.

And the worldwide popularity of the music artist could provide a big benefit for The Marvels next weekend./nGLENDALE, ARIZONA - MARCH 17: (Editorial use only and no commercial use at any time.  No use on ... [+] publication covers is permitted after August 9, 2023.) Taylor Swift performs onstage for the opening night of ""Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour"" at State Farm Stadium on March 17, 2023 in Swift City, ERAzona (Glendale, Arizona). The city of Glendale, Arizona was ceremonially renamed to Swift City for March 17-18 in honor of The Eras Tour. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nOff just $2 million from last weekend — a spectacular 88% hold — Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is on track for $250 million worldwide by the end of its historic run. No doubt the arrival of The Marvels will draw away some of the primary audience demographics for The Eras Tour, but on the other hand theaters featuring both films might benefit from Swifties deciding to make it a “double feature” night by seeing both films together, while walking out of The Marvels might have viewers flying high enough to choose a “double feature” approach by dropping in on The Eras Tour afterward./nWith The Marvels tracking to a $130-150 million worldwide opening according to recent data, any boost from Taylor Swift’s film and fans would be a welcome turn of events. Indeed, I’m surprised Marvel didn’t attempt to make a deal with Swift to help promote The Marvels by attending the premiere in LA and endorsing it, while getting theaters to promote “double feature” screenings of the films together as “Taylor Swift: The Marvels Tour” or some such marketing./nSwift is savvy and could get a lucrative deal for some opening weekend dollars, support for her own film in Marvel’s marketing for The Marvels, and maybe a promise to get her into the MCU in a prominent role. Dazzler is the common favorite answer, but I’d argue she’s a strong contender for Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Emma Frost, Magik, and any number of others as well./nBut even without overt promotional tie-ins and endorsements, fans on both sides of this equation might be inclined to feed one another’s energy at the box office this weekend, showing up in groups and wearing their respective merchandise, with plenty of overlap between the two groups and likely at least a decent number who’ve already seen both films or plan to./nSo there might be some instant synergy built into this equation that standard tracking doesn’t tell us about, although obviously this is speculation on my part and would also probably include lost audience to both films due to the competition, so the question would be which film benefits more from either and both influences./nThat said, I feel the early positive reactions to The Marvels coupled with its fast pacing and under-two-hours runtime will create a unique environment at the box office this weekend. The top two films could be — or are likely to be — women-driven releases accounting for the overwhelming majority of people at the box office this weekend. I say that because I feel pretty confident Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour will wind up in second place again this weekend due to overall stronger holds than the rest of the competition./nSo with Taylor Swift the leading contender to take the silver medal this weekend, and what that means for a box office that could be dominated by women-led audiences overall (when the total percentage of women is tallied up, particularly for the top five), I feel there’s some reason to feel hopeful that the weekend turns out better at the box office than early reports suggest. If they haven’t already, both camps — Swift and Marvel — should be looking at how promoting one another’s films would probably be helpful to boost both’s chances, even without any official coordination./nLongterm, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour could potentially add to its $250 million final tally (where I believe it will finish its run), if Swift makes another deal to return her film to theaters around Christmas if the rest of the competition is stumbling or underperforming (as I think at least one or two will, unfortunately from a box office standpoint). If that window of opportunity opens, then Swift could wind up seeing a final 2023 box office cume in the neighborhood of $300 million for The Eras Tour./nBut even without such a rerelease, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is already an incredible success and has established the groundwork for an entirely new approach to concert films and distribution. Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé will seek to replicate the success, or some degree of it depending on the details of release, when it hits theaters December 1st. The timing and epic scope of the film could help ensure Renaissance is another blockbuster concert film, proving the genre has definitely taken a major turn in prominence and potential in the theatrical marketplace./nThis could, should, and hopefully will spawn a whole new interest and approach to concert moviemaking, including more immersive experiences, exclusive experiences, live experiences, and approaches expanding the creation and use of spaces such as The Sphere in Las Vegas./nIt would be wonderful to see this sort of emergence of concerts and musical experiences as a major new part of theatrical, and in turn it would obviously have all sorts of positive influences on the expansion and technical evolution of theaters, projection, seating, sound, and how we directly or indirectly interact with the storytelling./nAnd on the flip side, it would be amazing to witness the ways music and concerts and interactive live performances evolve and turn into deeper multi-layered storytelling by necessity, a process enhanced by as well as even partially driven by specific changes to filming and distribution and platforms that the films themselves necessitate, and so on./nWhatever the future, this weekend it will be all about The Marvels, and Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour could play either a mild spoiler role or the role of booster. It will be interesting to see which way things turn out, and I’ll be back with updates on how it all plays out.

59,Nicole Sperling,Taylor Swift’s ‘Eras’ Is Easily the Biggest Concert Film Opening Ever,"The movie made an estimated $95 million in ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada, giving a big boost to theaters suffering from strike-related delays.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/business/media/taylor-swift-eras-movie-box-office.html,The New York Times,business,us,2023-10-15T16:11:04+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,59,"Advertisement/nSupported by/nThe movie made an estimated $95 million in ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada, giving a big boost to theaters suffering from strike-related delays./nBy Nicole Sperling/nWhile she wasn’t able to hit the astronomical heights predicted for her concert film, Taylor Swift is still the current hero of the movie business./nThe world’s biggest pop star has easily won the weekend box office with her concert film “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” with an estimated three-day gross of $95 million to $97 million in North American theaters./nThe PG-13-rated film, with a close to three-hour run time, has given Swifties and non-Swifties, young and old, a reason to return to the movie theaters at a time when theaters need it most. The ongoing actor’s strike prompted studios to postpone six major fall releases like “Dune: Part Two” and Sony’s “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” sequel, a loss that analysts predict could cost the movie business $1.6 billion in worldwide box office receipts./nAnd the box office in North America is still recovering from its prepandemic heights, down about 17 percent from 2019 when 16 more films were released in theaters./nThe Taylor Swift film, which cost around $15 million to make, opened in 3,855 theaters in the United States and Canada. (Ms. Swift added a preview night of screenings on Thursday in 2,700 theaters to accommodate the seemingly insatiable demand for everything Taylor. Those showings grossed $2.8 million.)/nThe film earned an additional estimated $31 million to $33 million across 94 international territories in over 4,500 theaters, putting its global receipts at $126 million to $130 million. It will expand to additional international locations in the coming weeks./nCulled from the six nights she performed at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles in early August, the film features some 40 songs and covers her past 10 albums. The whole movie takes place onstage with no behind-the-scenes or backstage footage included./nMs. Swift bypassed the traditional studio system, partnering directly with AMC Theaters to distribute the film, just nine weeks after her domestic concert tour ended. There was little traditional marketing support for the movie. Instead, Ms. Swift communicated directly with her 350 million social media followers. She will begin the international leg of her tour in February, in many of the same places where the movie is playing./nAs part of the deal with AMC, Ms. Swift earns 57 percent of ticket revenue, meaning she walked away from the weekend with around $55 million, not including her cut from international sales. With tickets costing $19.89 (in homage to her birth year) for adults and $13.13 (her favorite number) for children ages 2 to 12 and people 60 and older, the film is still a boon for theaters, which are encouraging the celebration with relaxed cellphone policies, specially licensed popcorn tubs, friendship bracelet-making stands and even some custom drinks. A theater in Boise, Idaho, is selling Taylor Swift nonalcoholic beverages, like a maple latte titled the “All Too Well,” in honor of Ms. Swift’s 10-minute ballad./n“Eras Tour” is easily the biggest concert film opening ever. The previous record-holder was the Paramount Pictures’ release in 2011 of “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,” which made $41 million over its first three days in North American theaters, adjusted for inflation, and ultimately $101 million in the United States and Canada and $138 million worldwide./n“Michael Jackson’s This Is It,” released by Sony Pictures in 2009, holds the record for total ticket sales. It generated $105 million over its entire North American run, and $380 million worldwide, adjusted for inflation./nBeyoncé made a similar deal with AMC, and her concert film “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé” will open on Dec. 1./nMany in the movie industry are now wondering how long Ms. Swift, who confirmed her ubiquitous presence by making a cameo appearance on the season premiere of “Saturday Night Live,” will keep her audience coming to the theaters./n“We’re going to assume the box office will double from here, but there’s no precedent for this; we’re in uncharted territory,” David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers, wrote in his recent analysis./nAdding to its unique nature, the film will only run on Thursdays through Sundays./nElizabeth Frank, the executive vice president in charge of programming at AMC, said in a statement on Sunday that because of “tremendous recommendations and fans buying tickets to see this concert film several times,” she expected the film would play “to big audiences for weeks to come.”/nThe next big film to open is Martin Scorsese’s three-hour epic “Killers of a Flower Moon,” which will debut in over 3,000 theaters next weekend. Yet, the western thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone isn’t likely to see its audience overlap much with “Eras,” which, according to exit polls, skewed 78 percent female. The next likely blockbuster on the docket is Marvel Studios’ “The Marvels” starring Brie Larson. That doesn’t open until Nov. 10./nNicole Sperling is a media and entertainment reporter, covering Hollywood and the burgeoning streaming business. She joined The Times in 2019.

Then came the internet./nBy Madison Malone Kircher/nEverything has changed for Bryan West./nGannett, the largest newspaper chain in the United States, announced on Monday that Mr. West would fill a much-coveted job as the company’s first-ever Taylor Swift reporter, covering all things related to the international pop sensation for USA Today and Gannett’s network of more than 200 other papers across the country./nBut before Mr. West, 35, had the chance to file his first story on his new beat, he was getting criticism from two sides: journalism watchdogs and Ms. Swift’s fans./nThe objections started rolling in shortly after Variety broke the news of his hiring on Monday. The article included an interview with Mr. West, which provided newsroom ethicists and Swifties alike with grounds for complaint./nMr. West, who was formerly a TV news reporter in Phoenix, raised hackles by describing himself as “a fan of Taylor.” That remark caused some journalists to question whether or not he could be unbiased when it came to his new beat. At the same time, the singer’s fans debated whether he was a big enough Swiftie to capture their beloved star. Some people in both camps said the job was better suited to a woman./nIn the Variety interview, Mr. West likened himself to a sports reporter in making the case that he could maintain his neutrality. “I would say this position’s no different than being a sports journalist who’s a fan of the home team,” he said. “I just came from Phoenix, and all of the anchors there were wearing Diamondbacks gear; they want the Diamondbacks to win.”/nThat remark did not sit well with a number of sportswriters, including Frankie de la Cretaz, a Boston-based sports and culture journalist./n“Any sports journalist will tell you the No. 1 rule of sports journalism is no cheering in the press box,” Mx. de la Cretaz, 38, said. “It’s one of the hallmarks of the profession. It’s one of the first things you learn. The idea, of course, being that if you are a fan of the team, that you can’t be an unbiased reporter.”/n“I don’t know that I necessarily think that’s true,” they continued, “but I think the fact that he is making that comparison shows to me a fundamental misunderstanding of what the role of a sports journalist is.”/nBenjamin Goggin, an editor at NBC News, criticized the hiring of Mr. West on X, writing that Gannett had given the job to “a full stan, rather than someone who is capable of being critical of one of the most powerful people in all of pop culture.”/n“Haters gonna hate,” Lark-Marie Antón, Gannett’s chief communications officer, wrote in an email, replying to the criticism from journalists. The spokeswoman added Mr. West’s credentials “made him the best candidate for this role.” (Mr. West, who is now based in Nashville, at a Gannett daily, The Tennessean, declined to be interviewed for this article.)/nApril Glick Pulito, a Swift fan who works in political communications, posted lyrics from a Taylor Swift song in response to the hiring: “I’m so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man?,” Ms. Pulito, 35, wrote on X, quoting “The Man,” which reimagines the singer’s life had she been born a man./n“It wasn’t a statement on the chops of this reporter,” Ms. Pulito said in an interview. “He seems extremely qualified. But as someone who works in communications, I think the optics of the choice are kind of undeniable.” She would have preferred to see the role go to a female applicant, “someone so many Taylor fans could look up to and see themselves in,” she said./nThe Gannett spokeswoman said the company “does not discriminate.”/nIn a year when seemingly anything having to do with the singer has drawn media scrutiny, Gannett’s announcement that it planned to hire a dedicated Taylor Swift reporter generated plenty of headlines and online comments./nThe chosen candidate, the company said when it launched the search in September, would “identify why the pop star’s influence only expands” and “what her fan base stands for in pop culture.” (The company also announced a search for a similar role to cover Beyoncé.)/nAs part of his application, Mr. West submitted a five-minute video listing the reasons he should be hired. The first was his journalism experience. Mr. West previously worked as a broadcast reporter and producer at an NBC affiliate in Phoenix and said he had won several awards./nHis second reason was that he had met Ms. Swift. The opportunity to meet her arose after he reported several stories about Ms. Swift while working in Phoenix, he said. Mr. West included a photo of him with the singer in the video./nIn his application, Mr. West added that, though he might be a fan, he was able to report on Ms. Swift without bias. He listed three songs he “can’t stand” as evidence, including the track “It’s Nice to Have a Friend.”/nInitially, Variety quoted Mr. West as having named the song as “It’s Good to Have a Friend,” a mistake on the publication’s part, which alarmed a number of Swifties, who inferred that he wasn’t up to the task./nMr. West also noted that he was five years sober. “I’ll never fail a drug test,” he said in his video application. On his personal website, Mr. West posted an essay that goes into detail about leading Phoenix police officers on a car chase and serving jail time for a drunken-driving charge in 2018. “Bryan has been forthcoming disclosing his personal journey,” the Gannett spokeswoman wrote in an email./nLauren Lipman, 32, was one of the applicants who didn’t get the job. Ms. Lipman, a Los Angeles-based content creator, has made a career out of posting videos predominantly about Ms. Swift. In September, Ms. Lipman received an email from a Gannett recruiter to discuss the role further, but ultimately was not called for additional interviews. (Gannett declined to comment on Ms. Lipman’s application process.)/nWhile she was disappointed to lose out on the role, Ms. Lipman wished Mr. West the best of luck. “I’m bummed, but I’m honestly, truly so excited that this position even exists. Like, go, Bryan,” she said./nThough critical of Mr. West’s reference to how sports journalists go about their jobs, Mx. de la Cretaz said they had sympathy for Gannett’s splashy hire./n“This is a brutal fan base, and I don’t think there was ever going to be any winning for whoever they hired into this role,” Mx. de la Cretaz said. “Either he doesn’t get respect from the general public because he’s a fan and seen as biased or he doesn’t get respect from the fandom itself because he’s not the right kind of fan.”/nBill Grueskin, a professor and former dean at the Columbia Journalism School, said that Mr. West’s passion for his subject could yield fine reporting. He also threw some cold water on Mr. West’s critics within the field./n“I think expecting journalists to completely suspend any kind of personal liking for a pop star or a baseball team is probably unworkable,” he said. “The key is kind of how you go about covering it.”/nGannett has yet to announce who will be covering the Beyoncé beat./nMadison Malone Kircher is a reporter for The Times. She writes about the internet for the Styles desk.

[+] on November 28, 2015 in Sydney, Australia.  (Photo by Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images)/nFans only need to wait about a month and a half before they get a new album from Taylor Swift. The global superstar is planning on dropping the re-recorded edition of 1989, now titled 1989 (Taylor’s Version), on October 27. As that date looms, it’s worth wondering which of the tunes from the set will become hits again, or perhaps for the first time. One track is already earning the spotlight, and it might become another major win for the singer./nSwift formally announced 1989 (Taylor’s Version) at the last stop in America (for now) on her The Eras Tour several weeks ago. She told the crowd at SoFi Stadium, and thus the rest of the world, that the re-recorded album was coming in a part of the show when she plays two tunes that aren’t normally featured in the setlist. This moment mixes things up and makes the shows interesting for Swift and the audience. She chose to reveal the upcoming set and then play a tune from the original 1989, “New Romantics.” Now, that cut may have another shot at becoming huge./n“New Romantics” was released as the seventh and final single from 1989. It was originally only featured on the deluxe version of the album, and it wasn’t promoted heavily, as Swift had already been pushing the pop album for years by that point. The tune performed only alright, only rising to No. 46 on the Hot 100, failing to even break into the top 40 region./nIn the years since then, “New Romantics” has become a fan favorite. It is regularly singled out by many die-hard supporters of Swift as a beloved 1989 composition that never got what it deserved. Now, Swift has the chance to change that and potentially score another hit with the upbeat and catchy cut./nThe fact that “New Romantics” will forever be associated with the incredibly exciting reveal of 1989 (Taylor’s Version) might be enough for it to rise even higher on the Hot 100 when it’s released as “New Romantics (Taylor’s Version).” It now holds an even more special place in the hearts of fans than it did a month ago, and millions will forever associate it with that thrilling moment when Swift revealed the cover and release date of 1989 (Taylor’s Version)./nThere is plenty of precedence to suggest that many of the songs on 1989 (Taylor’s Version) might outperform their predecessors. A number of cuts originally released on earlier albums, now re-recorded and re-titled, have gone on to peak higher than the first takes./nFor example, “All Too Well” was a medium-sized chart win for the singer more than a decade ago from her album Red. It was always beloved by fans and critics alike, but wasn’t a huge hit during its initial run. When it was re-released with Red (Taylor’s Version) as an extended cut, its lore made it a No. 1 smash on the Hot 100./nRecent electronically produced pop hits from Swift like “Cruel Summer” and even the “From The Vault” cut from Red (Taylor’s Version) “Message in a Bottle” both proved their popularity when they hit the Hot 100 as well. There is a desire for that kind of radio-ready pop sound that she dabbles in from time to time, and “New Romantics” ranks as among the best examples of that style when it comes to Swift’s back catalog./nThere’s no word yet on what Swift plans on doling out as a single from 1989 (Taylor’s Version), or if she’s going that route at all. If she does push “New Romantics” as a single again, it will almost surely rise higher than it did the first time around./nIf she doesn’t do so, “New Romantics” may still debut and peak in a loftier spot than the original take. Interest in all things Swift, especially this re-recordings project, is at an all-time high. Pair that with a seemingly never-ending love for 1989 and its songs, and it's a recipe for success for all the tracks on the album, including some fan favorites./n",4.822051946,61,Discography,0

This summer, she and Taylor Swift seemed to prove it./nBoth Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” and Ms. Swift’s “Eras” tours have become cultural phenomena that have swept across social media and are poised to shatter real-world records. “Eras” could top $1 billion in sales, making it the first concert in history to cross that mark. Some estimates suggest that Beyoncé’s world tour could gross even more than that by the time it wraps in October./nOpen this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS./nIt is the latest — and some economists think final — iteration of the “revenge spending” trend that took hold after the pandemic, in which people shifted their spending away from goods and toward experiences. Taylor Swift and Beyoncé fans have been shelling out on everything from secondhand tickets that cost more than a flight to Europe to fancy fingernails to match the singers’ wardrobe./nWhile event spending overall is still just recovering to prepandemic levels, the marquee concerts this summer are spurring a lot of consumption./nThe survey company QuestionPro estimates that Ms. Swift’s concert could generate some $4.6 billion in economic activity in North America alone, taking into account both stadium capacity and people’s reported spending plans on things like tickets, merchandise and travel. That would be roughly on par with the revenues the Beijing Olympics generated in 2008, after adjusting for inflation. Beyoncé’s shows are expected to spur $4.5 billion in spending, based on a separate QuestionPro survey./nIt isn’t just tickets that have motivated people to open their wallets. They are staying in hotel rooms, buying elaborate outfits, spending on flashy manicures and attending sideline parties that are generating business and boosting spending in host cities./nShade Hotel, in Manhattan Beach, Calif., held a Taylor Swift pre-party where guests sported costumes, wore Swift-themed temporary tattoos and sipped on a signature “Lavender Haze” cocktail, a reference to one of the most popular songs on her latest album. Both the hotel and its neighbors reported surging demand that pushed up room rates and sold out many properties./nBoxie Studio in Los Angeles, which offers small photo studios of carefully curated backdrops for social media, was selling tickets that allowed visitors to film TikToks or snap Instagram shots in rooms that mirrored Taylor Swift music video sets. Props included the red scarf made famous by the song “All Too Well” and an “I love you” sign like the one that a lovelorn Ms. Swift flashed at her next-door neighbor in one 2009 music video./nKnock-on effects from the concerts have drawn the attention of national economic authorities: Sweden’s statistics agency said that Beyoncé’s tour helped to fuel inflation there, and a Federal Reserve survey of business contacts reported that Swifties had bolstered hotel revenues in the Philadelphia region./nWhile concert-related spending has not been concentrated enough to show up clearly in national data in the United States, some think it could help to slightly improve the odds of a gentle cool-down instead of an abrupt stop to economic activity. The events are keeping consumers active during a summer when shrinking savings might have otherwise slowed their spending./n“I think Taylor Swift is great for the soft landing,” said Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School. /n“The Beyoncé tour, the Eras tour, are the latest instance of that phenomenon,” he said — and possibly the tail end, as consumers exhaust pandemic savings and return to more normal patterns. “It might be that Taylor Swift and Beyoncé timed their tours perfectly.”/nThe concerts have become a big boost for local tourism, as the Fed report hinted. Airbnb reported that Cincinnati was the platform’s top trending destination for July 4 weekend travel — beating out places like Mykonos island in Greece and the Amalfi Coast in Italy. The Ohio city hosted Ms. Swift that weekend./nThe shows have also driven broader consumer spending in cities like New York, where searches for lounges, aestheticians and nail technicians in the week leading up to Beyoncé’s performance in East Rutherford, N.J., saw triple-digit percentage increases compared to the year before, according to an analysis by Yelp. Concertgoers were also booking their hair and nail appointments weeks out./nRaven Voorhees, the owner of Free Edge Beauty Studio in Brooklyn, said she spent the month of July doing nails for clients attending Beyoncé concerts in cities like Philadelphia, Nashville and East Rutherford. Her clients requested nails that aligned with the theme of the Renaissance tour: lots of silver, metallic, gold and sparkle./n“It’s boosting business,” Ms. Voorhees said. “We’re talking about someone who’s paying about $60 max for her service to now $150 because she’s doing a new set, she’s getting the works, all of the nail art and then, even after that, having to come back and having to do it again.”/n Tara Lewis, who analyzes Yelp’s data around the “Beyoncé bump,” said she had seen “pops in every city” which gives her confidence that Beyoncé is the reason behind the lift./nAmerica’s hot concert summer has been enabled, in large part, by a hot job market. Unemployment is low and wages are rising, which is helping people afford big purchases like tickets and pricey hotel rooms./nIn a survey fielded for The New York Times, QuestionPro found that about 50 percent of Taylor Swift fans used regular income to buy tickets and outfits, while 9 percent used savings built up during the pandemic. A bigger share used savings amassed before or after the public health crisis or relied on family help. Just a small share — 4 percent — borrowed money to afford the tickets./nBeyoncé fans also funded tickets heavily out of their income, and spent $1,800 on average for the concert./nMany companies have figured out how to capitalize on the hype. Ahead of Beyoncé’s New Jersey appearance, Circle Line Cruise — a New York staple known for ferrying tourists around Manhattan — transformed into a dance floor where boat riders learned the Renaissance concert choreography. The 78-year-old cruise line has been trying to find ways to attract new customers and give locals a reason to step on board, said Alexis Melendez, Circle Line’s marketing director./nThe event, which took place the Thursday before Beyoncé’s MetLife performances, sold out. The three-level cruise ship held about 300 people who had paid $25 for the two-hour ride where attendees grooved to a D.J. playing Beyoncé’s thirty-year discography and followed directions from the dance instructor Byron Freeman./nCircle Line doubled the amount of bartenders, who were making $16 Beyoncé themed cocktails with names like “Alien Supermarg” and “Rum the World.”/nIn Los Angeles, companies also seized on Taylor Swift’s concerts to host branded activities. Truly LA, a venue showcasing the hard seltzer brand, hosted a friendship-bracelet making event on the sidelines of Taylor Swift concerts./nSwifties wear and trade the jewelry as a reference to a lyric in a song from Ms. Swift’s latest album, in which she instructs listeners to “make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it.” The events, which took place on Aug. 2 and Aug. 3, also encouraged attendees to trade their bracelets while listening to Ms. Swift and consuming specialty seltzer drinks./nTara Vasquez, 39, stood outside of the Beyoncé show in late July in sparkling bejeweled eye make up, explaining that she has “a credit card for Beyoncé.” She has gone to shows in each Beyoncé tour dating back to Destiny’s Child, she said./n“Beyoncé is a splurge because she understands me; We grew up together,” she said./n“Beyoncé says show up, and we show up,” she said. The artist has not released a visual album with Renaissance like she had for her previous albums, but Ms. Vasquez said: “We are the visual.”/n“Beyoncé got a lot of money out of me: At this point, I’m going to claim her as a dependent on my taxes,” Kalen Allen, 27, said outside of the MetLife stadium as he prepared to see Renaissance for the second night in a row. Professionally styled in a red and black ensemble, he estimated that he was spending $15,000 across multiple shows in multiple cities./nBibi Peterson, 16, was attending Taylor Swift’s concerts in Los Angeles three times — including on Aug. 4 with her grandmother, brother and other family members. Her outfit cost her only about $25 in materials from Amazon, she estimated, because her grandmother sewed it.

Despite his three touchdown passes, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wasn’t the star of the show. In fact, it wasn’t any of the players on the field./nIt was Taylor Swift who captured the attention of the cameras, announcers and seemingly everyone else with a pulse. Swift, who was sitting in a suite with the mother of Chiefs star Travis Kelce, captivated the audience with nothing but her presence. /nIn the weeks prior to the game, rumors started to circulate that Kelce and Swift were dating. Swift’s appearance at the game all but confirmed those rumors. /nIt’s fun to see the birth of a relationship, especially when the two people involved are some of the most popular figures in their respective fields. However, the social media posts and news headlines that took over the news cycle for the past week have gotten very old, very quickly./nWhat was an exciting merger of stars has turned into this nonstop production of content that uses the same one-liners to poke fun at the newest power couple. And the media loves it — they can’t get enough. /nThe new couple has gotten so much attention that it seems like some of the most prominent news outlets are prioritizing pushing out material that has any and all information about Kelce and Swift. /nThere are actual newsworthy events that are getting pushed to the side in favor of the duo. News about the couple has become so commonplace that it’s become more of a nuisance than entertainment. /nThis trend is indicative of the modern state of media and media consumers across the country. Rather than focusing on important events, trivial and inconsequential headlines tend to dominate the headlines. /nThis is highlighted by Gannett’s — one of the largest newspaper chains in the United States — decision to hire a reporter specifically to cover Swift. Whereas publications typically have a team of reporters dedicated to covering topics like local news, sports or entertainment, there will now be a reporter at publications such as USA Today who will only focus on Swift. /nThe relationship has also begun to feel commercialized and seems to be used to promote the products of the two superstars. Following Swift being spotted with Kelce, Kelce’s jersey sales skyrocketed — increasing by nearly 400%. /nSwift, who has a movie based on her Eras Tour in the works and a new re-recorded album coming out later this year, is also unlikely to suffer financially for this latest media stunt. /nKelce and Swift are also complicit in this. While some may think that they deserve some privacy as a couple, regardless of their stardom, neither has tried to hide from the attention. /nOn his podcast, New Heights, with his brother Jason Kelce, Travis was not afraid to talk about Swift’s appearance at the game. The fact that Kelce is openly discussing the topic on a platform available to the masses shows that the couple doesn’t mind exposing private details about their relationship. /nIt’s tough to feel sympathetic for a couple whose combined net worth is more money than most people can fathom. It’s even tougher to feel sympathetic when they themselves are indulging the public’s fascination with their private life. /nSwift was also spotted supporting Kelce again in New York as Kelce and the Chiefs faced off against the New York Jets on Sunday night. To celebrate her appearance at the game, NBC aired a monologue from “The Voice” host Carson Daly explaining what all the media hype is about. /nDaly did not forget to make as many references to Swift’s music as he possibly could./nWhile the relationship is certainly interesting and worthy of being talked about, there is a limit on how much we should be talking about it — and we’ve reached that point. /nThis editorial was written by Opinion C0-Editor Brett Abrams/nComments are closed.",-3.496700467,69,Dating,0
70,Mikael Wood,"Counting Crows' Adam Duritz on Taylor Swift, Bob Saget and trying to hit that high note in 'Mr. Jones'",The singer-songwriter expounds on his mental health struggles and his friendship with the late Bob Saget: 'I’m never gonna get over this one.',https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-09-06/adam-duritz-counting-crows-bob-saget-taylor-swift,latimes,general,us,2023-09-06T17:59:27+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,70,"In September 1993, Adam Duritz and his Bay Area folk-rock band, Counting Crows, released their debut album, “August and Everything After,” which went on to sell 7 million copies, spawned an inescapable radio smash in “Mr. Jones” and turned the dreadlocked Duritz into one of Hollywood’s most enthusiastic daters of actors (including, as the story goes, two “Friends” cast members in Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox)./nThree decades later, Duritz is still attracting famous and beautiful women./nOn a recent evening, Counting Crows played to a full house at the Troubadour as a means of drumming up excitement for a North American tour that circles back to Inglewood’s YouTube Theater for a show Wednesday night. Among those gathered to hear “Mr. Jones,” “A Long December,” “Round Here” and the rest was Cindy Crawford, whom the next morning Duritz insisted he doesn’t actually know./n“A million people came backstage and said, ‘Cindy Crawford’s at your show!’” the singer, 59, recalled with a laugh in an interview at his West Hollywood hotel. “I was like, ‘Huh, cool.’”/nFor the current tour, Counting Crows — with a lineup of original members, longtime players and newer recruits — are joined by the veteran emo act Dashboard Confessional, whose Chris Carrabba has become a close friend of Duritz’s in New York, where they both live. In May, Duritz and his girlfriend, filmmaker Zoe Mintz, went to see Taylor Swift’s Eras tour at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium with Carrabba and his wife./nDuritz’s verdict? “I was floored,” he said./nYou sound surprised.Chris knows her really well, and I was a big fan when she started, but I hadn’t listened to her for about 10 years. My girlfriend is obsessed and she got us tickets and she made me a playlist — I couldn’t believe how good the “Folklore” and “Evermore” stuff was. A lot of big shows don’t interest me because it just seems like it’s people plus dancers plus whatever. But this was a work of art — like some combination of Broadway show and Universal theme ride./nI noticed at the Troubadour that you had a music stand with a binder on it. I assume it had song lyrics, but you never once looked at it.I’ve always had a binder with lyrics sitting at the back of the stage under the piano — just there if I need to look for something. Of course, it’s essentially useless because if I do need to find a lyric, I’m not gonna be able to get under the piano, flip through the binder and find it in time. But after COVID — I mean, two years was the longest I’d gone without playing a gig since I was a kid. And when we got into rehearsals for that tour, I was like, “F— hell, I got a lot of lyrics.” You know, “Palisades Park,” that’s like 10 minutes long. I’m like, “How did I write all this s—? Why did I write all this s—?” So I was just nervous that I wasn’t gonna remember stuff after those two years./n Music /nParrotheads know: Jimmy Buffett was not just a brand, he was a gifted singer-songwriter with a keen understanding of middle age and the American dream./nSept. 2, 2023/nLast night you let the audience take over for the chorus of “Mr. Jones.” What are you thinking in those moments?There’s something so galvanizing about an audience singing your song. But “Mr. Jones” — that’s a really high note. I often let the first one go to the audience, but there’s a part of me that thinks: I’m 59 now. They probably think I can’t hit that note anymore. I’m gonna sing the rest of ’em myself. But last night I had no voice — I’m just getting over a chest infection. I knew I wasn’t gonna hit it./nSo the haters were right.In this case, absolutely./nI went back and read some old Counting Crows reviews in The Times. There’s one of a gig you played in Irvine in 1997 that says, “Duritz is one of the few who can make Jackson Browne and Morrissey seem cheery by comparison.”I’m assuming that wasn’t a great review./nIt was not. But does that description square with how you thought of yourself at that time?Well, I had a pretty severe mental illness that I wasn’t talking about publicly back then. I spent a lot of time depressed, and clearly the writer got that. But it’s a weird thing as an artist to have your life judged solely by people who don’t know you — and with no sympathy, only ridicule. I got myself locked up at the UCLA Medical Center for a little bit [in 2001] because I was having some troubles and just needed to settle things down because I didn’t feel safe. And the day I checked in, Mariah Carey checked out, and I remember the media circus that went on with her and how people made fun of her. That stuck in my head./nHow you feeling these days?Mental illness isn’t like breaking your leg. It’s closer to a handicap than it is to an injury. But at least if you realize what it is, you can spot it when it’s going on. You can go, OK, I’m not crazy — my mind just does this when this happens. And you don’t feel like you’re losing touch with reality. I started to feel safe talking about it around 2008, when we released “Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings,” because I didn’t feel like I was circling the drain anymore. But I’m not a spokesperson for s—. I don’t really feel the responsibility to be everyone’s flag-bearer for mental illness./n Music /nIn his weird and luscious signature song, Gary Wright, who died Monday at age 80, captured a vision of tomorrow haunted by the memory of yesterday./nSept. 5, 2023/nYou worked at the Viper Room when you moved to L.A. Why was a well-known rock star tending bar?When I got home to North Berkeley from the end of the “August” touring — this is like January of ’95 — that first week was kind of a nightmare. There were kids literally camped out on my lawn. I knew [Viper Room owners] Sal [Jenco] and Johnny [Depp], and I got a phone call from them where they started to invite me to something. Then they’re like, “Whoa, what’s wrong?” I explained what was going on and they put me on hold. I’m sure I’ve fictionalized this somewhat, but in my memory they came back five minutes later and said, “OK, you have a reservation on the 7 o’clock flight from Oakland to Burbank. Someone will pick you up at the airport, and we got you a room at the Bel Age. It’s Kate Moss’ 21st birthday — the Viper Room is closed for the night and we’re having a party. You gotta get out of Berkeley.” So I did, and I kind of never went home again. Stayed at the Bel Age for a while, then got a bungalow at the Sunset Marquis. Eventually Shannon, one of the bartenders, found me this house to rent. I’d go to the Viper every night and hang out. They were the only people I knew, really. At some point, Shannon had to go to the bathroom or something and she’s like, “Can you handle this?”/nDid you know how to make drinks?I learned./nSurely people knew who you were.Which is why it was all the better to be on the other side of the bar. I’m kind of shy, and it gave me something to do. People would come and talk to me and I didn’t have to be wandering around by myself in a crowd. I met girls and I met Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs and Tom Petty and the Hughes Brothers. Everyone that was doing something interesting in L.A. was there./nYet you left L.A. in the early 2000s for New York.I came here from the Bay Area because the struggling artist’s town that I came from wasn’t happy with my success. And L.A. is a working artist’s town. I felt like somebody normal when I got here. But it kind of changed when reality TV came in. There was a culture of famous-for-being-famous that got really tiresome to me. I went to New York and just found myself having more interesting conversations. Mary-Louise Parker is one of my best friends since we were young, and she and Billy Crudup were together then. One night Billy and I went to see Noël Coward’s “Private Lives.” Alan Rickman and Lindsay Duncan were in it. And after the show, we went backstage and had drinks in Alan’s dressing room, then we all went out to dinner and Rosemary Harris came by the table at one point. It was this incredible experience with these older British actors who were really smart and cool, and I just thought, “If I moved to New York, I could have conversations like this.”/nWhereas here you could hang out with the cast of “Laguna Beach.”Or, like, “That ’70s Show.” Who are actually really nice people. Well, the ones that aren’t in jail./nCounting Crows’ first few albums came out on David Geffen’s label. Ever meet him?Yeah, sure — he was great. After the band blew up, I was summoned out to his house. Got in the car, drove out to PCH, count up to 20,000 or 30,000 or whatever the address was. I ring the doorbell on this wall and eventually this butler guy opens the door: “Oh, Mr. Duritz, please come in.” All at once I see the bright greens of the lawn and the blue of the ocean, and there’s Geffen standing at the end of this long pathway. He greets me and we sit on this patio off to the side of the house and they bring lunch to us, which is like a seared tuna salad. I remember this so vividly because each vegetable in the salad was like the greatest vegetable that had ever been. I’m thinking, “Does he have specialized farming servants who pick each individual tomato?” Just an unreal explosion of salad-ness./nWhat’d you talk about?All kinds of stuff. He told me about leaving New York to drive up to Woodstock with Joni [Mitchell], then realizing the traffic was too much but she’s gonna write a song anyways. He told me about working with Jackson [Browne] early on. You know what really struck me? This is a guy who’s done a lot of great s— in his career. But in his mind the greatest thing he ever did was the Eagles. I like the Eagles, but I wouldn’t put them at the top. I’m a Flying Burrito Brothers guy, a Gram Parsons guy. But the Eagles sold a gazillion albums and made more money than all the other acts put together. And that was his greatest accomplishment because for him it’s not just a music thing but a business thing. It was his idea: “You guys aren’t gonna make it on your own — you should make a band together.” It’s like deciding you should do personal computers and starting Apple./nYou were close with Bob Saget, who died last year. What was the essence of your friendship?I met Bob because my goddaughter’s godmother [Lori Loughlin] was on “Full House.” They’d all come to the shows early on. Everyone who knew Bob thought they were Bob’s best friend. He made you feel that way when you were with him, like you were the most important person in the world. It’s weird: I’ve had people in my life die before, but I’m never gonna get over this one. I’ll be in the middle of something and I’ll just wanna talk to him and realize I’m not going to. It’s kind of devastating./nYou’ve got other friends in comedy. Ever try stand-up?I could never do it. It’s the most death-defying performance art there is. I’m in awe at the speed at which those guys’ minds work. I’m a smart guy, but I got nothing on that./nAt the show last night you had a Badfinger T-shirt on. Now you’re wearing a Sunflower Bean shirt. How much thought do you put into your choice of band shirt?Last night I was going between a bright-red Big Star shirt, the Badfinger one and a Bowie shirt with the art from “Space Oddity.” I went with what looked good with my pink shoes./nDo you have a ton of band shirts?I don’t have anything else. My biggest bummer about getting on the plane to come here was that my girlfriend bought me a Taylor Swift “Midnights” shirt that just was a little too tight, so I didn’t bring it. I gotta lose a little more weight before I can wear it./nIt’s good to have a goal.It’s literally what I’m working towards: to wear the Tay-Tay shirt./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

[+] Monday, Aug. 7, 2023. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift recently made headlines after displaying an extraordinary gesture of generosity, one which others in the entertainment industry—and beyond—could learn from./nIn the middle of her The Eras Tour, which just wrapped its first U.S. leg and is headed to Central America very soon, Swift gave everyone who works on the venture a bonus. But these weren't your typical bonuses. She reportedly handed out an astonishing $55 million in gifts, including $100,000 for each truck driver who brings the production from city to city. That’s a “life-changing” sum for people who may make that much in a year, and some from her touring crew spoke out thanking her publicly./nIn another part of the entertainment world, times are especially tough for creative people. Both movies and TV shows are almost completely halted because writers and actors are on strike against the major studios and streaming companies. Those who actually write and star in the shows and films that entertain the world are asking for better treatment, including a say in how AI is used, more money and fair compensation through residuals, among other things./nOn the other side, the big shots in the business are not willing to give in on many points, leaving the money unevenly distributed. They have their reasons as well, but ultimately, the situation is not looking good, and those in power are not winning the PR wars, as they come out appearing to be the bad guy—and if you ask many in Los Angeles, it’s because they are./nSome folks in the movie and TV industries argue that there just isn't enough money to go around, which makes it hard to pay actors and writers more, even if they're struggling to make ends meet. The argument often comes down to the wealthiest people—like top actors, big directors and executives at companies like Netflix
NFLX
 and Disney—being seen as greedy, with some of them worth hundreds of millions, while writers are struggling to pay their rent./nA CEO who brought home tens of millions and who runs a conglomerate with billions complaining that there simply isn’t enough money to pay writers a few extra dollars isn’t a great way to win over the masses and come out of the situation looking benevolent./nThis is where Swift's actions can teach those in power a lesson. She's at the very top of the music world, the most successful artist in the world, and one of the bestselling of all time and the driving force behind The Eras Tour. While she's a main reason for its success, she also knows it's not all about her./nSwift realizes that her current success is thanks to a lot of people working hard behind the scenes. But she didn't just say thank you. She showed her appreciation in the most practical way possible: with money. She recognized how much everyone's efforts contributed to the tour's incredible production values, rave reviews and historic box office sums, and, considering the immense revenue, decided to share the wealth instead of taking it all for herself./nSwift's The Eras Tour is expected to earn over $1 billion in ticket sales by the time it’s all done, with a large chunk of that—maybe half—going right to her. And it should! People aren’t paying to see a road hand or a truck driver, but she’s very aware of their importance./nSharing some of that wealth, as she did with her crew, seems like a no-brainer. Big CEOs and executives at companies like Netflix could do something similar, giving up a small part of their earnings to make sure everything runs smoothly and the final product is top-notch. This doesn't have to be a big ask. In fact, it seems to be the fairest way to reward talent and ensure things work well./nThose who have the power to resolve the Hollywood strike might want to consider what Swift has done. Her generous actions not only made everyone happy and earned her some well-deserved good will among millions, but those bonuses will surely continue to ensure that her money-printing venture goes well from here on out./nWhile $55 million is a huge sum of money, it is also only a relatively small figure compared to what The Eras Tour is bringing in. In fact, it may be only 10% of what she earns, or maybe 5% (or less!) of the trek’s total box office pull. Could a similar move help put thousands of actors and writers back to work and bring an unfortunate dispute to an end? It's something worth thinking about./n",2.802585093,74,Social impact,1

The set will almost certainly hit No. 1, giving the singer yet another leader on the ranking of the top-consumed albums in the U.S. Chances are some, if not all, of the tunes featured on the full-length will also reach the Hot 100, and there are a handful that deserve this second moment of attention./n1989 was a blockbuster release, producing a number of major hit singles. Three tracks went to No. 1 on the Hot 100, and several others broke into the top 10. While no one can say that the title didn't earn its due, there are several tunes on 1989 that might not have received all the love they could have the first time around. Now, fans have a second shot at propelling certain cuts toward the top of the tally./nThroughout her re-recordings project, several songs originally featured on older Swift albums have performed better after they were re-released, as they had become fan favorites in the years in between when they first arrived and when the singer doled them out again. So, why shouldn't the same happen for some of her 1989 tracks?/n""Style"" is one of the most memorable songs from 1989, and it was also one of the biggest hits as well. While ""Style"" did break into the top 10 on the Hot 100, it has gained even more of a following in the years since its heyday. Like tunes such as ""All Too Well,"" it would be great to see this cut hit a new high, perhaps even reaching No. 1...though that seems like a longshot./nThe final single from 1989, ""New Romantics,"" was not promoted as heavily as the six official cuts that preceded it. Originally featured as a bonus cut on the album, ""New Romantics"" failed to break into the top 40 on the Hot 100, which is very surprising for a single from the star. Swift played the tune immediately after announcing 1989 (Taylor's Version), so it now holds a very special place in the hearts of millions of Swifties. Turning it into a top 40 hit after all these years would be an incredible moment for the star and her followers./nThree songs from 1989 only missed the Hot 100 by a few spaces when they were first releases, settling for what's called the Bubbling Under Hot 100, which is essentially a 25-spot extension of the main ranking. So far, one of those tracks, ""This Love,"" has been released as a re-recording. ""This Love (Taylor's Version)"" finally reached the main chart after nearly a decade, peaking at No. 50. Now, it's time for the new takes on both ""All You Had to Do Was Stay"" and ""How You Get the Girl"" to do the same./nOf course, there are many other tracks from 1989, as well as a handful of new ones that have been added to 1989 (Taylor's Version), that will also likely hit the Hot 100 after the set has enjoyed a full tracking week. And fans of the singer all have their own favorites that they're hoping to push up the charts as well. How each tune performs will be announced by Billboard in a few days, but chances are most of the tracks on the title will make it to the Hot 100, even if they didn’t muster that performance the first time around./n",2.911578104,75,Discography,1

/n/nI’ve witnessed my longtime friend Lori Totten, of Brea, and her soon-to-be 19-year-old daughter Tiffany go to extraordinary lengths to join the millions of fans that scored tickets to see Swift out on her The Eras Tour. I was with Lori on a trip to Boston in 2019, sitting at an Italian restaurant and waiting for our dinner, when she manically tried to purchase tickets on her phone to Swift’s Lover Fest, the ill-fated 2020 outing in support of Swift’s seventh studio album, “Lover.” That would have played off as the first big concert at the all-new SoFi Stadium that year had it not been for the COVID-19 pandemic./nI just also happened to be with her and two of our girlfriends on a trip to Big Bear when Swift dropped her latest album, “Midnights,” last year. We stayed up to listen to the album through and through in our cozy cabin as the clock struck midnight./nWhen The Eras Tour went on sale last year and the overwhelming amount of fans crashed the Ticketmaster website, Lori and her longtime friend Andrea Ramos of Yorba Linda were both frantically attempting to score tickets to any and every show. By some divine stroke of luck — and hours and hours with no bathroom breaks — Ramos was able to pick up tickets for the Totten ladies, herself, and her 18-year-old daughter Emma, to Swift’s concert on May 5 in Nashville, Tennessee. After more stress and haggling, the two now-very-savvy ticket-buying women were finally able to secure tickets to a show closer to home and bought passes to see Swift at SoFi Stadium on the first night of the tour on Thursday, Aug. 3, too. The Totten’s are also going to the shows on Aug. 7-9 and Ramos women are headed to Aug. 7 and 9, too./nSo why all of the trouble and headaches just to see this one artist on tour?/nI joined Lori, Andrea, Tiffany and Emma on their ride to see Swift in Inglewood on Aug. 3 to find out that it wasn’t just about the music, there was much more to it./n“I just love what a phenomenal role model Taylor is for my kid,” Andrea said as we cruised down the 91 Freeway on the way to the show. “When ‘Reputation’ came out, Emma started having a stronger voice.

Not to mention Taylor is just kind, generous and a great businesswoman.”/nEmma and Tiffany have known each other since about the age of three and grew up dancing competitively — even one year dressing up as Swifties with blonde bob wigs and dancing to Swift’s music./n“Aw, we are each other’s longest friend,” Emma realizes as the two, who are cozied in the back of the vehicle adjusting their “Folklore” and “Midnights” themed outfits and pondering aloud which secret songs Swift will play later that evening. (Spoiler alert: It was “Maroon” and “I Can See You (Taylor’s Version)”.)/n“I have a bracelet that says ‘I heart Mama Swift’ and I just think Taylor’s mom has to be such a great person to have raised such a great daughter,” Andrea said, referring to Swift’s mother, also named Andrea, who has become a rock star herself at her daughter’s shows, as she walks the venues to meet fans./n“I mean, the two of us are raising daughters, too, and it’s not easy,” she added./nI asked the young women why they liked Swift’s music and was met with a loud “Pffttt” and a laugh from Emma, the kind of response only a teenager could deliver without uttering, “Duh! My mom’s friend” at me./n“There are too many things, I can’t even name,” Tiffany offered./nAnd I very much believe she feels that way./nFor their mothers, it has become something special that they can share with their daughters./n“It’s something that Tiffany and I can bond over,” Lori said. “She has her music and I have mine, but this is our music. I also love that Taylor is so great with her fans and the music just makes me feel good.”/nFor Andrea, this is her final summer at home with Emma for now, who is heading to Indiana State University next year. As luck would have it, the day we were headed to Inglewood, Swift announced additional dates for The Eras Tour in 2024. And she’s hitting Indianapolis, not far from Emma’s new college, in November./n“We’re going to try to get tickets,” Andrea assures. “I just like that I have this time with Emma. I get to experience this with her.”/nLori is the first to admit she’s gone a little overboard this year with The Eras Tour, especially with her outfits. Since she’s going to four shows in Inglewood, she has a different outfit for each evening, all inspired by Swift’s costuming in her music videos or on previous tours. She did give my friends and me a fashion show the week before of each outfit, stuff she purchased off of Poshmark and Etsy and went to work bedazzling and glittering herself to make the looks just right. She did this for herself as well as for Tiffany and she laugh-cringes when she shares the outfits for four Southern California dates and the early stop in Nashville cost over a grand. She and Tiffany also made dozens of Swiftie friendship bracelets, each one with a Swift saying and song titles or lyrics, dates and more that meant something to them./nAnd because they’re both cat ladies, just like Swift, Lori made tiny little friendship bracelets for cats to give fellow cat-loving Swifties./n“It’s crazy how much those little beads cost,” she said with a laugh./nSome may think it’s insane to indulge so much in a silly little concert, but as these women put the final touches on their outfits and drew on glittery 13s on the backs of their hands (Swift’s favorite number), I watched them laugh, smile, hug and at time squeal in delight as they met other Swifties on the way up to the Stadium./nIt was almost like a scene from the new “Barbie” movie — instead of the normal “Hi, Barbie!” greeting inside Barbieland, it was “Hi, Swiftie” in Taylorland. They took pictures, traded bracelets with other fans and danced to the Swift songs that were being played outside the venue in anticipation for the big event./nThey scream-cried-sang and danced through the entire show and took lots of pictures and videos to post on social media. And, of course, they picked up more merch./n“It’s totally worth it,” Lori said of their Eras Tour experience.",0,77,Social impact,1

Kelce appeared in the first sketch of the night — after Pete Davidson’s subdued opening monologue about the escalating war between Israel and Hamas — in an “NFL Sunday” segment about the sports world’s descent into Taylormania and pop culture’s new obsession with the NFL star. /nThis weekend’s box-office queen also appeared in front of the camera later in the episode to introduce musical guest and new pal Ice Spice. The clip, posted on “SNL’s” Instagram account, got Kelce’s seal of approval in the form of a “like” from the football star, who goes by @killatrav on the platform./nThe TV hits came together on the spot, long after the show had run through dress rehearsals for the episode, Variety reported, which could explain why there was little talking in each cameo. /n“The second [Kelce] walked in, they mentioned the sketch and he said he was happy to join,” the insider told the trade outlet. “They were happy to jump into some parts of the show when asked.”/n Movies /nA juggernaut opening weekend — historic for a concert film — will be a much-needed shot in the arm for an industry hobbled by strikes./nOct. 15, 2023/nNow back to the hand-holding, which apparently happened both inside and outside the studio and at the after-party./nPage Six reported that Kelce and the “Shake It Off” hitmaker were getting “handsy” during the show and were seen kissing at the premiere’s after-party at Catch Steak in the Meatpacking District. This after the two were photographed hand-in-hand on their way to the event. TMZ also obtained footage of the couple holding hands and hugging at the haunt./n“Travis and Taylor seemed to really be enjoying the night, and each other, even kissing throughout the night,” an insider told Page Six. “Everyone was in a great mood and having a great time. [Taylor] was seen chatting it up with the night’s musical guest, Ice Spice, and her friends.”/nThe colliding superstars, whose respective fame has collectively gone supernova, arrived at the party around 2:20 a.m. and eventually left the restaurant together around 4 a.m., Page Six said. /n Music /nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s rumored relationship has taken pop culture by storm.

Kelce apparently left to attend the Philadelphia Eagles game against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., where he supported his older brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce. After that, the younger Kelce returned to the city to have dinner with Swift and gave shutterbugs plenty of content  when he held her hand in front of the cameras./nThe singer-songwriter and the tight end were spotted walking hand in hand while leaving the Waverly Inn restaurant, according to People./nThe fanfare over the pair on Monday inspired Heinz and Hidden Valley to capitalize on the Swift-Kelce obsession, with the food companies announcing a meme-inspired limited-edition sauce./n“In honor of #Traylor, Heinz (Arrowhead Stadium’s supplier of both Ketchup AND Ranch) is creating and releasing 100 (13+87 because Taylor + Travis = 100?) bottles of Limited-Edition ‘Ketchup and Seemingly Ranch’ sauce,” a spokesperson told the “Today” show, referring to a viral moment from Swift’s appearance at a Sept. 24 Chiefs game./n“At Hidden Valley Ranch, we’re all about trendy, lighthearted fun. Seeing as we’re the Original Ranch, with Seemingly Ranch trending, we knew we needed to join in on the ‘seemingly us’ chatter!” a spokesperson for Hidden Valley added. /n Entertainment & Arts /nSince Swift was spotted watching Travis Kelce at Sunday’s Chiefs game, many have wondered what it means for the NFL.

The movie is built around her Los Angeles stops on her historic trek, which has now taken her to Mexico and will continue around the globe for the next year or so. The movie is on track to be a box office smash, but those future ticket numbers only tell part of the story when it comes to how much money Swift will make from the project./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is already pacing for a massive debut at the box office, with some industry projections placing its first weekend’s figure at $100 million or more. Remember, that number only reflects the first few days the movie is out in the world. The title could run for a few weekends, or perhaps months, and by the time all is said and done and it leaves theaters, there’s no telling how many more millions it might bring in./nIt’s also not entirely clear how much Swift is set to earn from Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. She and her team clearly led the charge of creating, filming and selling the title to a distributor, as they didn’t go through more traditional channels. How her deal was structured was never made public, but the star of the show is surely going to earn millions from the theatrical run./nOnce Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is done playing in theaters, it will find its way to the digital world, though what exactly that second life will look like in is unclear. According to a report published by Puck, the streaming rights to the movie have yet to be acquired, but many of the top platforms are likely making offers to the singer, clamoring to get an exclusive on what is about to become the most successful concert movie ever./nSwift has a history of selling her documentaries and concert films to streaming platforms. She’s worked with a number in the past, with some of her movies appearing on Netflix
NFLX
, Apple
AAPL
 and Disney+. The singer has also recently been synching some of her new songs in Amazon Prime Video shows, so that company is probably competing for this movie as well./nSwift apparently doesn’t have a preference when it comes to working with the major streamers, and she is surely accepting propositions from many of the entertainment giants./nWhat Swift has been paid for any of her past films has never been made public, but each project likely earned her millions. Fellow pop stars like Billie Eilish and Rihanna have reportedly earned more than $20 million for their docs, and Swift is even more popular, so it’s safe to guess that her payday for each of her docs was close to that sum./nAfter Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour wraps its historic box office run, there will be a clamoring among fans to know when they can see it again. This movie is the rare sort that may be big enough to convince some to sign up for a streaming platform they don’t already pay for, and that makes it incredibly valuable to any of them. The mere association with Swift is also worth paying handsomely for as well./nAfter earning millions of dollars in traditional movie theaters, Swift could earn millions more, if not tens of millions, when she sells the rights to Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. She might forgo such a plan, instead selling the film digitally and on DVD, but going with a streaming site will likely be easier and a clean, simple paycheck./nWhich company will win out, and when it might hit streaming platforms, is yet to be announced, but the deal will only add to the hundreds of millions Swift is set to take home from the tour itself, with this movie being another way she can become much richer thanks to this effort./n",0,83,Filmography,1

Our reporters debate the merits of the Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce era in pop culture,A sports reporter and an entertainment reporter sound off on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce and why their rumored relationship has taken pop culture by storm.,https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-09-28/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-reporters-experts-discuss,latimes,general,us,2023-09-28T23:30:48+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,84,"In case you haven’t heard, football fans are in their Swiftie era, and pop music fans are in their Travis Kelce era amid widespread rumors that the “Speak Now” artist and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end are an item./nMemes, TikTok videos, Instagram reels and timelines dissecting every inch of the celebrities’ rumored love story — from a viral photo of Swift wrapping her arm around Kelce’s neck (gasp!) to the musician’s choice of sauces (ketchup and “seemingly ranch”) while eating chicken fingers at Sunday’s Chiefs game — have dominated the news and social media./nAnd with Swift reportedly planning to make an encore appearance this weekend at the Jets vs. Chiefs game in New Jersey, there’s no telling what fresh Traylor content (Tayvis content?) awaits us. That’s why we, an entertainment reporter and a sports reporter, have gotten together to analyze this game of love. (Sigh, look what you made us do.)/nBut before we unpack some recent events that have unfolded in the Tayvis universe, let’s review some history./n Entertainment & Arts /nSince Swift was spotted watching Travis Kelce at Sunday’s Chiefs game, many have wondered what it means for the NFL. But what about Kansas City?/nSept. 28, 2023/nIt all started in July, when Kelce lamented on his “New Heights” podcast that he wasn’t able to meet Swift while attending one of her Eras tour concerts at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. “I was a little bit hurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” he said at the time./nSince then, cheeky remarks from Kelce’s older brother Jason and his Chiefs teammates (“Please, everybody, stop asking my brother about ... my love life,” the younger Kelce jokingly pleaded last week) have fueled the fantasy that the “Lavender Haze” hitmaker and the two-time Super Bowl champion will end up together./nThat fantasy came one step closer to reality on Sunday when Swift accepted Kelce’s invitation to watch him play at the same Arrowhead Stadium she recently rocked. The Grammy winner was spotted cheering enthusiastically for the home team alongside  the jock’s mother, Donna Kelce./n“Shout out to Taylor for pulling up, that was pretty ballsy,” Travis Kelce said Wednesday on his podcast. “It was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her.”/n“She looked amazing,” he added. “Everybody was talking about her in a great light and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course.”/nNow let’s kick off that discussion. /n Entertainment & Arts /nKansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce opens up about Taylor Swift watching him play Sunday. ‘It was definitely a game I’ll remember,’ he said./nSept. 27, 2023/nChristi Carras, entertainment reporter: So, Chuck, how does it feel to see Taylor Swift putting Travis Kelce on the map?/nChuck Schilken, sports reporter: Christi, I think you need to calm down (hahahaha! just wanted to get my favorite Taylor Swift song title in here right off the bat). But yeah, I actually have some thoughts on this apparent trend of football fans being triggered by that question./nCarras: LOL. Shake it off, Chuck! But also, say more. (We are of course referring to the TikTok trend in which women ask the male football fans in their life about Taylor Swift putting Travis Kelce “on the map,” causing their gullible targets to lose their minds.)/nSchilken: While the phrase “on the map” is kind of vague, overall it’s actually a pretty accurate statement. All football fans know who Travis Kelce is — two-time Super Bowl champion, three Super Bowl appearances, eight Pro Bowls, already considered a future Hall of Famer. And while he’s definitely known by some in wider circles (hosted “Saturday Night Live,” had his own dating show, apparently has his autograph tattooed somewhere on Post Malone), Kelce wasn’t close to being a household name before this. /n Sports /nPop star Post Malone challenged the Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce to beer pong and ended up with their autographs tattooed on his body./nJuly 14, 2020/nSo any football fan who flies off the handle at a non- or casual football fan suggesting Swift put Kelce “on the map” is basically behaving in the same way many people accuse Swifties of behaving whenever a slight toward their “Anti-Hero” is perceived. Swift has absolutely elevated Kelce several stratospheres in terms of mainstream recognition./nCarras: To your point, I have to admit that as a non-football fan I did not know who Travis Kelce was until this month. You also bring up an interesting comparison between Swifties and football stans. Many would argue — and have argued — that pop music enthusiasts (particularly young women and girls) are often judged harshly for obsessing over their idols, while sports fans don’t receive the same level of scrutiny for obsessing over their favorite teams or players. So it’s fascinating to see how this unexpected crossover has seemingly bridged those two worlds. /nThough I will say that I’m sure there were already tons of people in the middle of the Taylor Swift/football fan Venn diagram before this whole thing even started. What do you make of this moment that appears to have taken over every corner of the internet, from Swiftie circles to the NFL’s official TikTok?/nSchilken: I am honestly kind of surprised at how much the NFL and its fans are embracing this. Sports fans are notorious for worrying that any positive development in players’ lives will become a dreaded “distraction.” But on Sunday everyone seemed to enjoy the circus, with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and coach Andy Reid making jokes about it to reporters. (Even New England Patriots coach/super-grouch Bill Belichick chimed in from a distance). /n Music /nCultural dominance. History-making album sales. Sold-out stadiums. Add them up, and Taylor Swift’s current moment has little precedent in pop-music history./nAug. 1, 2023/nBUT! I can only imagine a completely different scenario if Kelce had a bad game or if the Chiefs, a team with Super Bowl aspirations again this season, had lost or struggled against a horrible Chicago Bears team — it would be like a flashback to the “Jessica  Jinx” or “Carrie  Curse” labels given to Tony Romo’s high-profile romances with Jessica Simpson and Carrie Underwood during his playing days with the Dallas Cowboys./nCarras: Ouch! Hoping for Swift’s sake that society has evolved past that misogynistic nonsense. I too have been overwhelmed by the amount of pro-Travis Kelce content I’ve been seeing on my feed — from fancams of him dancing in the end zone, to the tune of Swift’s “Cruel Summer,” to slow-motion videos of him allegedly gazing lovingly at Swift in the stands. /nEven the NFL got in on the fun with a hilarious TikTok breaking down the romance rumors and incorporating some pretty clever Swift puns. I feel like I’m getting Travis Kelce-pilled and, honestly, I’m not mad about it? I went back and watched a bunch of clips from his “Saturday Night Live” episode — he has a winning smile and great comedic timing! And I hear he’s pretty good at sports too. So I can see the appeal./nSchilken: Well for me I guess it’s a little different. I did know who Taylor Swift was long before this (as did every other football fan — they are lying if they tell you otherwise). The only songs I know are from the radio and there are a few I really like. But I was also suffering from a bit of Taylor fatigue after this everything-Eras summer. And to be honest, I was even starting to get tired of Travis Kelce, as he and his brother Jason (the Philadelphia Eagles center) and their parents seemed to be the subject of every feature story going into this year’s Super Bowl (which, yes, was dubbed the Kelce Bowl by many) and Travis’ profile had continued to rise all offseason, even before all this. /n Sports /nTravis and Jason Kelce are on opposing sides for the Chiefs and Eagles in the 2023 Super Bowl, and their father understands their competitive nature./nFeb. 3, 2023/nBoth Kelce brothers are very outgoing and have great personalities and without a doubt have their sights set on being the next Manning brothers when their playing careers are over. So I’m sure Travis is glad Swifties approve of him. But I will admit to being a little more than slightly annoyed this week when my feed is full of nothing but Taylor-Travis “news” when I just want to read about football./nCarras: That’s funny — this is the first time I’m hearing the term “Kelce Bowl.” Most people in my orbit referred to this year’s Super Bowl as “the Rihanna concert” (and what a concert it was!). But I can definitely understand the fatigue. I guess most of the countless headlines I’ve seen have focused on their rumored relationship. So I’m sorry but I have to ask, in your professional sports-journalist opinion, do you think Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are actually dating?/nSchilken: YES!!!! I mean, if they’re just a couple of buddies trying to punk everyone for a few laughs, they’ve really put way too much effort into it at this point. Plus, some of Travis’ comments in his podcast with his brother Jason on Wednesday — “What’s real is that it is my personal life and I want to respect both of our lives” — really sound like he’s talking about something more than just a casual friendship. /nWhat do you think?/nCarras: I am dying at the level of enthusiasm behind that response. You make some good points — the “personal life” comment definitely made my ears perk up too. But I have to say I am a little skeptical. ... I think there’s a decent chance that this Super Bowl champion invited his pop star crush to come watch him play from his VIP suite, and Swift just figured, why not? Sounds like fun. He’s team captain, and she’s on the bleachers. But who knows? Maybe there is something more to it than that./n Music /nThe film was shot during Swift’s record-breaking six-night stand at SoFi Stadium and will open in theaters on Oct. 13./nAug. 31, 2023/nI will say that Kelce would be a bit of a departure from her recent dating habits — and not just because he’s a pro athlete. She recently got out of a long, relatively low-key relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, who kept details of their romance pretty private. So the fact that Kelce is constantly getting asked about her on his podcast and in  interviews — not to mention the NFL milking this moment for all it’s worth and capitalizing on her stardom — that’s a lot of variables for someone as visible as Swift to weigh when considering whether to pursue a relationship with someone in the public eye. /nI personally like the idea of them just being two buds supporting each other’s work, but I know a lot of people suspect it’s all just a big PR stunt. What are your thoughts on that theory?/nSchilken: Well if it’s a PR stunt, the only one I can see really getting anything out of it is Kelce, just because it has raised his profile in a way that will make him super marketable now and much more recognizable when he’s  pursuing his post-NFL projects. I don’t really think the NFL is necessarily milking it — they seem to be doing all right for themselves and I think are just having fun with all this. /nAnd if it is a PR stunt, then I guess it’s like you said and Taylor is just having fun, because I really can’t think of any other way she benefits from this. But I also know she is very good to her fans and can’t imagine she’d lead them on about something this important. That would be cruel — and it’s not even summer anymore./nCarras: OK, OK. I know the NFL isn’t exactly a small local business in need of extra support, but the league is definitely benefiting from all this attention, and it knows it. My colleague Alexandra Del Rosario reported this week that Kansas City ticket sales and Travis Kelce jersey sales have increased significantly amid all the Traylor (Tayvis?) excitement, and much of the buzz I’ve seen about Swift attending Sunday’s game has been filtered through official NFL channels. Heck, a prominent NFL announcer made a “Blank Space” joke before Swift was even spotted at one of Kelce’s games./n Music /nTaylor Swift cheered on her rumored beau, Travis Kelce, alongside his mom, Donna Kelce, at the Chiefs game in Kansas City on Sunday./nSept. 24, 2023/nBut I digress (steps down from soap box). I agree that Swift doesn’t really have much to gain from this from a publicity standpoint — but I’m sure her team will nonetheless enjoy any bump in preorders for her upcoming album, “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” and box-office revenue for her Eras tour concert movie, both debuting next month. /nI actually did put out a request to a music data analytics firm because I’m curious whether Swift’s streaming numbers have noticeably spiked in recent weeks. While we await the official results, it’s kind of fun to guess which Swift tracks have been streamed the most in this moment. What do you think the standouts will be?/nSchilken: Hmmm. I would think Chiefs fans who are not super familiar with Swift’s catalog might be scanning the list to see if there’s anything that might provide some insight into what their beloved tight end might be experiencing at this moment of (alleged) blossoming romance. /nSince Taylor does have a song simply called “Love Story” (in multiple versions, no less), that might be a good place to start, maybe followed by “You Belong With Me” and “Lover.” And then, the Kansas City fans might look for some breakup songs (“I Knew You Were Trouble” and “We Are Never, Ever Getting Back Together” seem like obvious choices) just to see how that might go for their guy if the (alleged) relationship doesn’t work out./nBut I know you have a much greater knowledge of her music than I do. What do you think the top picks might be and do you have any recommendations for curious Chiefs fans who might not be all that familiar with her work?/n Sports /nBianka Bryant, daughter of Kobe and Vanessa, gets ‘22’ hat from Taylor Swift as Eras tour stops at SoFi Stadium for six nights. The Bryants are famously Swifties./nAug. 4, 2023/nCarras: All great picks! I have seen “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me” referenced a lot recently (Swift falls in love with a football player in the music video for the latter), so I think you’re probably right on target there. A slightly deeper cut from her early career, the sentimental ballad “Fifteen,” has also gained some traction because of the lyric “In your life you’ll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team.” /nAnd of course, “Cruel Summer” — one of the opening numbers from her sold-out Eras tour — has been having somewhat of a renaissance and has been the soundtrack of many a Travis Kelce TikTok floating around the internet. So I wouldn’t be surprised if that one got a streaming boost as well./nAs far as recommendations go,  her catalog is full of so many bops that it’s hard to choose. However, the thought of a whole stadium of Kansas City fans belting the lyrics to the 10-minute version of “All Too Well” (a la Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own” becoming the unexpected anthem of the Boston Red Sox) and exchanging friendship bracelets is so entertaining that I’m inclined to leverage this opportunity to manifest it. Perhaps my wildest dreams will come true at this Sunday’s game — isn’t Swift rumored to be planning to attend?/nSchilken: Yes, she is. But it’s a road game for the Chiefs, so Swift’s love story (sorry, I’m at the point in my Taylor knowledge where I need to start recycling song titles) with home fans in Kansas City will have to be put on hold. That’s not to say, of course, that New York Jets fans and the “Sunday Night Football” camera operators aren’t going to be thrilled to have the pop icon in their presence at MetLife Stadium. And maybe NBC will have better luck than Fox, which reportedly tried and failed to get Swift’s permission to use her music during the Chiefs-Bears game./nCarras: Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling 22 — er, I mean I’m certainly planning on tuning in to find out./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

The film, which will showcase Swift's massively successful The Eras Tour, is expected to be a box office smash. In fact, predictions already place its opening weekend pull at $100 million or more. All that money will surely make Swift happy, but that might not be the end of the rewards coming to her for the movie./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour may one earn the star of the picture the Best Music Film Grammy. The superstar has already won a dozen Grammys, but she's never competed in this specific field, and her latest movie may change that... though she'll have to wait a while before earning that nomination./nBest Music Film was introduced in the '80s by the Recording Academy to ""honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position."" In the past, the prize has gone to a mix of concert films and documentaries about music and musicians, and Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour should be considered a frontrunner... when it's actually eligible./nTo be eligible for consideration in the Best Music Film category, any concert and/or performance films or music documentaries must be released in theaters, be put up for sale to the general public, or air on TV (or in today's world, streaming platforms) within the eligibility window, or some combination of those. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is hitting theaters across America, so that immediately makes it eligible, though fans shouldn't expect it to count among Swift's upcoming nominations./nThe cutoff date for the 2024 Grammys was September 15, 2023, so that means that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour won't be able to compete at the upcoming ceremony. Instead, it will be eligible a year later, when it will likely be a serious contender for the Best Music Film award. By then, the movie may have also made its way to streaming platforms, though Swift and her team have remained mum on that subject./nSwift is expected to be one of the top nominees at the 2024 Grammys, even if she can't go out for Best Music Film. She has several albums and many singles that are eligible for consideration, and she's likely to dominate not only the top categories but also the pop and perhaps country fields as well.

AFP PHOTO/  ROBYN BECK (Photo by ROBYN BECK / AFP) (Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)/nFor several months now, Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” has ranked as one of the biggest songs in America. The tune quickly broke into the top 10 on the Hot 100 after it was officially released as a single, but it hasn’t quite worked its way to the peak position. With a slew of new releases vying for attention and more major drops coming soon, can Swift compete and send her electro tune to the No. 1 spot?/nThis week, “Cruel Summer” ranks at No. 5 on the Hot 100, earning another turn inside the top 10. The track has thus far climbed as high as No. 3. Now, it’s dipped in its standing from the period prior, and both Swift and her legion of followers may have to settle for it being a top 10 win and not a No. 1, as it looks like claiming the throne is a dream that increasingly seems less and less likely to happen./nFor the past several weeks, splashy No. 1 debuts have kept “Cruel Summer” from ruling. First, country newcomer Oliver Anthony started his breakout smash “Rich Men North of Richmond” atop the Hot 100 in a surprise move. The cut went viral almost immediately after being released, and it earned a pair of frames in charge of the ranking./nThen, when it seemed like “Cruel Summer” might have a shot at climbing to a new peak position on the Hot 100, it was beaten again by another new leader. Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves earn their first No. 1 on the chart this frame, with “I Remember Everything.” That cut also starts in first place at the same time Bryan’s self-titled album rules the Billboard 200./nIt’s worth mentioning that other tracks appeared ahead of “Cruel Summer” in both of these instances, but the attention paid to both Anthony and Bryan and Musgraves’s hits did not help Swift’s cause to claim another No. 1 on the Hot 100./nNext week, it looks like Doja Cat will dominate the Hot 100 with her single “Paint the Town Red.” This turn, the cut rises from No. 5 to No. 3 in just its fourth frame on the chart. As the release date for her new album Scarlet nears, fans are supporting the rapper and singer in droves, and she may be on her way to another leader very soon./nFollowing Cat’s likely ruling, there are a handful of albums that could produce new No. 1s on the Hot 100, or at least top 10s whose debuts might result in “Cruel Summer” falling again. Olivia Rodrigo’s album Guts is out now, and it will likely make a huge impact on the Hot 100 next week, perhaps even sending several cuts into the highest tier on the chart./nLater this month, both Cat and Drake have full-lengths set to drop, and of the two, the latter star could easily claim another No. 1 hit, as he often does when he has a full collection to share. His album For All The Dogs has already produced a No. 2-peaking single with “Search & Rescue,” and there’s no telling what he has coming soon./nAt this point, it still remains entirely possible that “Cruel Summer” will find its way to the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100, though its chances may be dwindling. If the song was sitting at No. 2, it might have a better shot at the penthouse, but the fact that it’s slowly working its way down the chart isn’t a good sign for its future./n“Cruel Summer” is finding it difficult to compete with new releases from superstar and viral entrants that can’t be beaten. If Swift pulls out all the stops and gives the world more reasons to stream and buy the cut, it might have a shot, but there’s a real chance it won’t ever make it to No. 1./n",1.457078434,86,Achievements,0

Or blow off labor solidarity in favor of fans who have in some cases traveled thousands of miles and spent thousands of hard-earned dollars to see their idol?/nThe mere thought of a postponement stokes terror in the hearts of parents whose teenagers would melt down faster than ice in the desert if their coveted tickets were suddenly just bar-coded promises of future fun./nBut this week, more than four dozen state and local politicians, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, who is running to be our next governor, sent an open letter to Taylor asking her to “stand with hotel workers” and postpone her L.A. dates. /nIt’s an ask that Swift can’t just shake off, because hot labor summer has been as fiery as her Eras tour, which may end up being the highest-grossing concert tour in history. Across the country, workers are unionizing and striking, fed up with income inequality and lives of scraping by — as they should be. No one should work full time and still be forced to live in their car, or even on the streets. No one should end the month at a food bank because their paychecks don’t feed their families. /n Entertainment & Arts /nNot a lover of $100 parking spaces? There are plenty of ways to get to Taylor Swift’s concerts at SoFi Stadium by train or bus./nJuly 31, 2023/nSince July 20, the housekeepers, cooks, front desk clerks and other workers of Unite Here Local 11 have been striking against about 60 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Like their striking union sisters and brothers at SAG-AFTRA, they want wages and benefits that keep up with the cost of living. And like their striking siblings, they’ve had little luck convincing bosses to make progress at the bargaining table. /nIt’s easy to see this letter to Swift as nothing more than a political ploy to grab headlines, and in one way it is. Here we are talking about it. /nBut it’s also smart strategy. Strikes are about pressure, economic and social, and the juggernaut of these Swift concerts is unprecedented, even by L.A. standards. /nMedia reports said the dancing and sound from her Seattle show set off the equivalent of a magnitude 2.3 earthquake. And according to some estimates, the tour could generate nearly $4.6 billion in consumer spending in the United States alone, with Swift pulling in $13 million a night just for herself. /nWith that kind of force, Swift has the power to change the course of the strike, even without canceling a show. /nIf the striking workers can get her attention, and her sympathy, imagine the power of Swift visiting a picket line for a photo op, or bringing strikers up on stage with her? That’s hundreds of millions of fans who suddenly have no doubt the strikers are in the right. /n“When you sit on the sideline and say nothing, I think that’s the worst thing you can possibly do,” Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer (D-Los Angeles) told me Wednesday. He’s one of the politicians who signed the letter, and a longtime member of Service Employees International Union 721. /n“Everyone needs to take to the streets and say we need to do the right thing,” he said. /nEven Swift./nWhich is why they asked, and why they think she’ll answer. /nIn her early years, Swift was staunchly apolitical, fearful, she has said, of Dixie Chicks-style blowback if she stepped out of line in her country music world. /nBut her world has grown and so has she, and in more recent times she’s become an outspoken powerhouse who can sway public opinion with a single word to her hundreds of millions of fans. /nIn 2020, she took on Donald Trump during the unrest after the murder of George Floyd. Trump tweeted about wanting to send military troops into Minneapolis. /nSwift shot back via Twitter, where she has 93 million followers. /n“After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? ‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’??? We will vote you out in November,” she wrote. /nMore recently during her Chicago concert, she spoke out against the wave of anti-LGBTQ+ laws that have been passed across the nation./n“Right now and in recent years, there have been so many harmful pieces of legislation that have put people in the LGBTQ and queer community at risk. It’s painful for everyone. Every ally, every loved one, every person in these communities,” Swift reportedly told the crowd. /n Entertainment & Arts /nParking! Public transit! Fan chants! Friendship bracelets! Everything you need to know before you see Taylor Swift at SoFi Stadium for the L.A. stops of her Eras tour./nAug. 4, 2023/nSwift isn’t blind to the struggles of the working class, either. Just this week, she reportedly gave $55 million in bonuses to nearly everyone toiling on her tour — including a reported $100,000 to each of the truck drivers hauling her gear from town to town. /nThe owner of one of those trucking companies called it a “life-changing sum of money” for the men and women who have spent the last 24 weeks on the road with Swift, and of course, it is. And it doesn’t hurt the cash came with a handwritten note from the megastar to each of those workers. /nAnd let’s not forget she’s fought the man on her own behalf. For the past few years, Swift has been rerecording her old albums because she doesn’t own the masters to those songs. She signed a bad contract when she was a teenager, giving ownership of them to the label./nLater, the rights to those recordings were purchased by music manager Scooter Braun, with whom Swift has had an epic feud to regain control of her music. Her victory came with deciding to rerecord her early works, giving her complete ownership of the new material and him the proverbial middle finger. So you know she’s a brawler, and believes in fair compensation, even if it requires a fight. /nSo fear not, Swifties.

(Photo by John Medina/Getty Images)/nThe first leg of Taylor Swift's highly anticipated The Eras Tour came to a thrilling close as the superstar took to the stage this past week, not just to perform her chart-topping hits, but to make a monumental announcement. Amidst the roar of the crowd, Swift confirmed what fans had eagerly anticipated: her iconic album 1989 will soon be reborn as 1989 (Taylor’s Version)./nThis re-recording and re-release project, the latest in a series from the singer-songwriter, immediately became a trending topic all around the world. With a late October street date looming, there are plenty of signs that point to 1989 (Taylor’s Version) potentially becoming Swift's most monumental re-release yet./n1989 already holds a special place in Swift’s discographies as one of her most significant albums. In terms of units moved, the title ranks second in her catalog, boasting an impressive nine million equivalent units in the U.S. While Fearless has achieved the coveted milestone of 10-times platinum, commonly referred to as diamond status, 1989 holds its own unique claim to fame./nThe set marked Swift's transformation from country favorite into a veritable pop sensation, a genre she has dominated ever since. The album's irresistibly catchy melodies and chart-topping singles solidified its status as an indelible pop culture cornerstone, and fans can’t wait to hear it again./nAt the heart of 1989’s success lies a trio of smash singles that all reached No. 1 on the Hot 100. Swift's infectious hits, ""Shake It Off,"" ""Blank Space"" and the collaboration ""Bad Blood"" with Kendrick Lamar, dominated the airwaves and left their mark in music history. Additional singles like ""Wildest Dreams"" and ""Style"" also reached echelons of the top 10./n1989 secured five top 10 hits back when doing so meant more than it does today. Now, many artists debut tracks inside the region, only to see them disappear. This phenomenon wasn’t frequently seen nearly a decade ago. It is worth noting that while Swift's album Midnights boasts the most top 10 hits of any album in history (10 at one time, no less), many of these entries had fleeting stays in the upper ranks of the charts—a contrast to the remaining popularity of 1989./nThe anticipation surrounding the re-recording of 1989 is warranted given the album's extraordinary string of hits. The enduring allure of these favorites is evident in their continuous streaming and radio play. 1989 sounds like a compilation of Swift's greatest hits, it’s so packed with winners. With Swift breathing new life into these beloved tracks through reimagined versions, it is only logical to anticipate that 1989 (Taylor’s Version) will become a monumental success, potentially outshining its predecessors./nSwift's re-recordings project has thus far proven to be an unmitigated triumph. Each re-released album, including Fearless (Taylor’s Version), Red (Taylor’s Version) and Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), have all confidently seized the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart. These releases have exhibited a pattern of continuous growth, with each subsequent debut amassing larger and larger streaming and sales figures./nWith Swift's confirmation that 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is coming in a few months, and the idea that not only will she reinvigorate some of the biggest singles of this generation, but also deliver previously unheard tracks as well, anticipation is at an all-time high. As the release date approaches, the set’s debut promises to be huge, potentially cementing 1989 (Taylor’s Version) as the crowning jewel in Swift's re-recording endeavor—a fitting homage to the album that propelled her into the stratosphere of pop music./n",1.380511029,90,Achievements,0
91,Yahoo Movies,"'Reptile' director Grant Singer talks Benicio Del Toro, working with the 'incredible' Taylor Swift and why he'd 'love' to helm NSync's next music video","Filmmaker breaks down his new Netflix thriller, which reunites Del Toro and Alicia Silverstone, as well as his signature music videos with Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and The Weeknd.",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/grant-singer-reptile-benicio-del-toro-taylor-swift-justin-timberlake-nsync-140049660.html,sports,general,us,2023-09-29T14:01:49+00:00,FALSE,TRUE,91,"Attention '90s kids: The new Netflix thriller Reptile features a very important Excess Baggage reunion that reteams Benicio del Toro and Alicia Silverstone for the very first time since that 1997 Blockbuster staple. And for that reason alone, you've got to — in the words of another song from that late-'90s era — praise first-time feature filmmaker Grant Singer like you should. But the music video director-turned-narrative filmmaker tells Yahoo Entertainment that he can't take all the credit for bringing Del Toro and Silverstone back together as, respectively, small-town detective Tom Nichols and his wife, Judy./n""Benicio and I were talking about who could play Judy, and he mentioned Alicia,"" recalls Singer, who was 17 when Excess Baggage drove into theaters. ""Having worked with her and known her for so long, he was aware she could inhabit the role in a really interesting way. Alicia brings such a vulnerability and strength to that relationship — she's really the emotional anchor of the film.""/nMeanwhile, Del Toro brings the heat... and we mean that in the Michael Mann sense. Tom is a former Philadelphia cop who left his previous job after an investigation into his corrupt partner. Freshly relocated to New England, he gets tangled in another web of deceit that originates with the murder of a local real estate agent — potentially by her partner, played by Justin Timberlake — and stretches back into Tom's new department. Eventually, the world-weary cop who just wants to stay neutral has to pick a side, even if it means upending the quiet life he promised Judy./n""We wanted to evoke the feeling of being deceived, and play with this idea of the hunter being the hunted,"" Singer says of the inspiration for Reptile, which he co-wrote with Benjamin Brewer and Del Toro. Additional inspiration was provided by films like Serpico and The Conversation, not to mention the work of another one-time music video auteur, David Fincher, whom Singer calls ""one of my favorite living directors.""/n""But I'll be honest — I was just trying to do me,"" he adds. ""This is my first film, so I was approaching it as: 'What do I want to do? What is my style?' I think it's ultimately about this balance between formalism, where things are very graphic and composed, but also the feeling that you're within a scene and the camera becomes invisible.""/nReptile arrives on Netflix after premiering at the recently concluded Toronto International Film Festival, which Singer attended without his cast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike. But Timberlake made some noise just as the festival was winding down, announcing his own long-awaited reunion with the NSync crew, which released their first album the same year that Del Toro and Silverstone loaded up their car with Excess Baggage. And Singer says he'll happily helm any music videos that the boy band might decide to do in the future./n""If they hit me up, I'd love to do it,"" Singer enthuses. ""I'm so grateful to have collaborated with Justin on Reptile. You can tell once you meet him why he's one of the world's greatest entertainers. He responded to my vision for the movie, and brought a lot of his own ideas. And that's all you can ask for as a director.""/n(Coincidentally, NSync dropped its new single, ""Better Place,"" on Friday — listen here.)/nWhile he hasn't directed an NSync video (at least, not yet), we spoke with Singer about some of his past collaborations with such major artists as The Weeknd and Taylor Swift, and why he has no plans to retire from the music video game, even if Reptile becomes Netflix's next viral sensation./nSinger's first major music video collab was with Sky Ferreira, who parlayed early MySpace fame into a successful singing and acting career. The duo made six videos within the span of a single year, including ""Lost in My Bedroom"" off of her EP Ghost. The evocative three-minute piece plays like a long lost found footage clip from the late '90s, when The Blair Witch Project was all the rage./n""Sky and I had been roommates in L.A. and we talked about making a lot of videos for that album cycle,"" Singer recalls now. ""'Lost in My Bedroom' was shot at another friend's house with no budget. I took a VHS camcorder and over there, and we shot a bunch of stuff in the middle of the night. And then I used this really cool technique of where we processed the footage through a TV screen and looped it back. It had this very surreal feel./n""That era of making music videos was very much about making stuff with friends and having fun,"" Singer continues. ""We were making things for the sake of making them. Looking back, those were some of the happiest times of my life because it was coming from such an innocent place.""/nThe year after his Fierra series exploded in a big way, Singer directed an explosive trilogy of videos based on three songs featured on The Weeknd's blockbuster sophomore studio album, Beauty Behind the Madness. And if you notice certain recurring scenes and characters — specifically Rick Wilder as a devilish figure — in all three, that's definitely by design./n""Story is too strong a word, but there were linked themes and ideas we were playing with in those videos,"" Singer says of how he and The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, conceptualized the series. ""Things like the idea of the self and the idea of the devil. We wanted to let the imagery and feeling speak for themselves. Abel and I have a very similar taste in films, and we were always talking about movies during those videos. We made them within five months of each other — it was like bam bam bam.""/nAnd, for the record, Singer says that he was a fan of Tesfaye's controversial HBO series The Idol, which was canceled after one wild season. ""I was so happy for him,"" the director says. ""I love to see him act, because he's a phenomenal actor and a great person, so I'm glad to see that he made a TV show.""/nNobody puts Lil Wayne in a corner. When the rapper appeared alongside Ariana Grande in the video for their Dangerous Woman track, he mostly directed himself. That was certainly the case for the final scene of the video where Wayne blows a puff of smoke in Grande's face mid-lyric and she starts cracking up./n""That was a spontaneous moment,"" Singer confirms with a laugh. ""When Lil Wayne comes on set, you just let him do his thing! Then you get out of the way, film it and call it a day.""/nEven when he's working with two major recording artists at the heights of their careers, Singer says that he approaches the task of directing the same way. ""For me, it's always about having conversations where we articulate our ideas,"" he explains. ""When you have two people like that on set together, it's still just a conversation. I wouldn't come over and give a note or direction unless I felt like I had an idea. It's all very informal — like three friends talking about ideas.""/nSpeaking of superstar pairings, Singer was behind the camera when Taylor Swift and Zayn Malik took a walk on the dark side — Fifty Shades Darker to be exact. The duo recorded the chart-topping single for the trilogy-capping Fifty Shades installment. It was another smashing success for Swift, just ahead of her Reputation era./nAnd Singer found that Swift more than lived up to her reputation as a creative dynamo. ""I don't have enough nice things to say about her,"" he raves. ""Taylor's one of the sweetest and inspiring artists, and so down to Earth for being the biggest celebrity on the planet. I'm so grateful she called me to do that video.""/nAnd Swift plans to add ""feature filmmaker"" to her résumé as well. The singer — whose upcoming concert film, The Eras Tour, is on track to break box-office records — struck a deal with Searchlight to helm a narrative feature from a screenplay that she wrote. (Swift previously directed the short film, ""All Too Well,"" which screened at TIFF's 2022 edition.) ""She's going to be a phenomenal director,"" Singer says. ""Taylor's a once in a generation talent, and I can't wait to see the movie she makes.""/nAfter the lush visuals of ""I Don't Wanna Live Forever,"" Singer embraced simplicity for his first collaboration with breakout New Zealand singer, Lorde. The director pulled out a 16mm camera and headed to L.A.'s MacArthur Park neighborhood with his star in tow. ""We wanted the video to feel timeless and that area almost looks like an artifact from the past,"" he says. ""It's not specific to L.A., either — it could be Ohio or somewhere in the Northeast.""/nThe grainy 16mm visuals added to the video's timeless aesthetic, not to mention the saturated green colors that permeate the frame. ""I also love the amber light in that video,"" Singer recalls. ""There are these shades of color that feel very painterly. 16mm film oozes feeling — it's a little more pink and a little bit rougher and that felt like a nice counterpoint.""/nSinger may be the credited director on the video for Sam Smith's haunting ballad, but he credits the non-binary English singer with originating the idea of a mannequin head being the main character. ""That was entirely their concept,"" the filmmaker says. ""I can't take credit for it — all I did was execute it.""/nPart of that execution was finding the right visual references for the storefront, references that included vintage photographs and famous paintings like Edward Hopper's Nighthawks. ""Above all, I wanted that video to do justice to the song,"" Singer notes. ""Sam's song is so moving and emotional and a little bit harrowing, so the video needed to be that as well. I approach directing through feeling and emotion, and specifically with that one I was trying to capture a very particular feeling.""/n""To Die For"" was also the last music video that Singer directed before he turned his attention to Reptile. But he vows that it's not his final word on the form. ""I took some time off to make this movie, but I'd like to make more music videos for sure."" And Singer found a way to acknowledge his music video past in his feature filmmaking present by casting Sky Ferreira in a small Reptile role./n""The first day of shooting was a scene with Sky and Benicio,"" he says, proudly. ""I put her in the movie because I started my career making music videos with her. It was great to see how far we've both come.""/nReptile is currently streaming on Netflix. ",0,91,Unrelated,1

""Taylor Swift's Asylum Seekers ... A movie concert promotes post-Madonna, post-Obama mind control.""/nYou can read it all for yourself, but here's one excerpt that's getting mocked ... ""The Swift circus doesn’t replace the thrill of originality and profundity that accompanied the advent of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Supremes, the Jackson Five, which Gen Z knows nothing about. Instead, Swift specializes in degraded girl-pop -- teenage solipsism, the silliness that kids will ideally outgrow. Yet her songs corrupt puppy love into jejune sophistication.""/nHe then compares the movie's director, Sam Wrench, to Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl ... namely, making Taylor's concerts far more grand/aesthetically pleasing than they actually are in person, the way Riefenstahl did for Hitler -- at least that seems to be White's POV./nNot just this, but White actually tries to juxtapose Swfities innocently dancing in theaters to mass shooter James Holmes, intimating a connection by writing ... ""The teens in TikTok clips who pitifully bounce and sing along with the film’s pre-recorded concert are the flip side of those nerds and sociopaths who lined up for 'The Dark Knight Rises' in Aurora, Colo.""/nIf that sounds unhinged, that's because it is ... that's certainly how Twitter feels about it, anyway. They're unloading on White's hyperbole over something as benign as a concert film./nHe ends his scorched-earth review this way ... ""Boomer parents may want to let them have their fun — same as toying with matches and playing in the traffic. But here’s a frightening fact of the Swifties pheenom: These kids seem ready for a leader, anxious for totalitarianism. It will take a counterrevolution to repair Swift’s moral, aesthetic, and political damage.""/nFWIW, White is very much a man apart here ... 'cause just about every other film critic (big and small) has praised the 'Eras' movie for being what it is -- a wholesome, good time./nAlso ... her flick is poised to be the top dog (yet again) at the box office this weekend. 🤷🏽‍♂️",2.610058038,92,Filmography,-1

[+] Monday, Aug. 7, 2023.  (Allen J.

Movie studios invest significant time and money into promoting their films, carefully selecting the perfect launch dates to maximize box office success. But sometimes, even the best-laid plans can be upended by a juggernaut./nWhen global superstar Taylor Swift suddenly announced her upcoming concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in late August, it sent shockwaves through the industry. One little concert film started a domino effect of release date changes in a shift that is rarely seen in the business./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is an eagerly anticipated concert film that documents Swift's ongoing tour of the same name. Filmed during three shows at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in August 2023, the upcoming cinematic experience promises to be a huge win for the singer. What truly set the industry abuzz, however, was Swift's surprise announcement of the tour itself later that same month./nSwift's surprise tour announcement caught both studios and exhibitors off guard. Her unexpected move led to a sudden realization that several films were slated for release on or around the concert film's debut date, October 13, 2023. With Swift's immense popularity and the anticipation surrounding The Eras Tour—both on and off screen—studios knew that competing with her was a high-risk gamble. Consequently, they had to make some tough decisions./nIn response to the impending release of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, a number of major studios took swift action to avoid direct competition with the Grammy winner with their upcoming releases./nUniversal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions made the bold move to move up the release of The Exorcist—a reboot of the ‘70s classic—by one week, so it is now scheduled to hit theaters on October 6, 2023. This strategic decision allows the film to potentially capitalize on the Halloween season without clashing with Swift's concert film...at least not at first./nBut it wasn't just The Exorcist that shifted gears. Several other films changed their release dates to steer clear of Swift's cinematic juggernaut. All of the following films have also been moved from their original October 13 release so as not to face direct competition with the singer and her Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour:/n/n/nThe decision to alter release dates for these movies was not a simple one. In fact, it comes with significant financial and logistical challenges. Movie studios invest substantial resources in marketing and promotional campaigns tailored to their original release dates. Changing those dates could mean reworking advertising strategies and renegotiating partnerships or perhaps even creating additional content to maintain audience interest. All of these adjustments can incur unexpected expenses that impact a film's budget./nFurthermore, while some films managed to find alternative windows to release, they may still face the lingering impact of Swift's concert film. Even with a shift in release dates, they risk sharing the spotlight with a cultural phenomenon like Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour./nSwift's fan base is known for its unwavering dedication, and the film's release is likely to generate a massive wave of enthusiasm. Movies that debut shortly after Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour may find it challenging to compete for attention and box office success, as the fervor surrounding the singer’s film continues to resonate with audiences./n",0.595496868,98,Filmography,1

[+] Monday, Aug. 7, 2023.  (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nIn a thrilling finale to her the U.S. leg of her The Eras Tour, Taylor Swift gave her fans the long-awaited revelation they wanted. The pop icon chose last night to officially announce her next addition to the re-recording series: 1989 (Taylor’s Version)./nSwift's announcement electrified the atmosphere at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, leaving fans ecstatic over the news that the album is slated for release on October 27. Immediately after saying so in front of thousands, Swift took to social media to further tantalize her followers and provide a sneak peek into what lies ahead./nIn a carefully crafted Instagram post, Swift not only confirmed the impending release of 1989 (Taylor’s Version), but also shared a few key details about the project. Similar to her previous re-recorded albums, this upcoming release will feature a treasure trove of never-before-heard tracks. Swift's journey down memory lane has led her to unearth a collection of songs that were either written or recorded during the original album sessions but remained hidden from the world. These unreleased gems, affectionately dubbed ""From The Vault"" tracks, are among the most exciting facets of the re-recording process./nSwift's social media update provided a glimpse into the forthcoming album's unknown tunes. She revealed that 1989 (Taylor’s Version) will include five ""From The Vault"" songs, in addition to the beloved tracks from the original album. About these cuts, Swift said in the caption, ""the 5 From The Vault tracks are so insane. I can’t believe they were ever left behind.""/nWhile details about these tracks remain sparse at the moment, their potential for chart success is high. The combination of Swift's artistry, the nostalgia still felt for 1989 and its many hits as well as the aura of anticipation surrounding these unreleased tunes sets the stage for yet another triumphant chapter in her career./n1989 was a monumental triumph in Swift's time in the spotlight, solidifying her status as a global superstar. The album's extraordinary commercial success had led to it earning a nine-times platinum certification, and soon it may become her second diamond-seller. The album's singles, however, were the true driving force behind its enduring impact./nThe 1989 era saw Swift dominate the charts with three No. 1 singles on the Hot 100. It is one of only a handful of albums to send that many cuts to the summit, even to this day. Iconic tracks such as ""Shake It Off,"" ""Blank Space"" and ""Bad Blood"" featuring Kendrick Lamar, reigned supreme for a time./nSwift's subsequent albums have yet to match this impressive feat, as none of them have produced more than one Hot 100 No. 1. Among her leaders, ""Shake It Off"" stands as Swift's crowning achievement and biggest hit yet, as it has been certified diamond with over 10 million equivalent units moved in the U.S. ""Blank Space"" also emerged as a standout hit, as it has been certified eight-times platinum, tying as her second-most-certified single./nThe album's tracks have collectively amassed over 36 million equivalent units in the U.S. alone. Collaborating with super producers and renowned hitmakers such as Max Martin, Ryan Tedder, and Jack Antonoff, Swift meticulously crafted a masterpiece that seamlessly bridged her transition from country to the pop realm. This transformation culminated in numerous Grammy wins and solidified her status as a musical icon./nEach track on 1989 held the potential for standalone success as singles, and if she’d wanted to, she likely could have continued promoting the set for years. The original album did spin off half a dozen charting hits, and fans wanted more. Now, with the inclusion of the ""From The Vault"" tracks, the album's legacy is set to grow once more./nThe consistency of sound and thematic resonance throughout 1989 suggest that it’s likely that these five “From The Vault” songs are in the same vein. They could sound and feel similar, which immediately sets them up for success. Imagine another “Shake It Off” or “Style”? They could follow the surprising chart ascent of current single “Cruel Summer” which is also another electro-pop favorite that came several years later, inspired by some of the wins on 1989./nSwift's own excitement, reflected in her Instagram post, serves as a poignant reminder that these unreleased possible smashes possess the power to become hits in their own right. Nothing Swift says in social captions is a coincidence, so if she’s hinting that they could be huge, the world needs to prepare for them./n",-0.290581615,102,Tour,1

This album serves as a slight reimagining of her pop blockbuster 1989, which first captured the world's attention back in 2014. With an impressive seven singles under its belt, 1989 is undoubtedly one of Swift's most beloved and commercial successful releases./nWhen it comes to measuring the success of individual songs from 1989, there are many ways to measure one track against another. One easy way to do so is by delving into the consumption patterns of Americans and seeing what they’ve bought and streamed the most./nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the organization responsible for awarding gold and platinum certifications to songs and albums based on consumption in the U.S., provides valuable insight into which tracks have made the biggest impact./nTopping the list of Swift's 1989 hits, according to RIAA certifications, is the album's lead single, ""Shake It Off."" The infectious anthem stands as Swift's sole diamond-certified hit, an accolade achieved when a track or album surpasses 10 million equivalent units in the United States./nFollowing closely behind is the chart-topping sensation ""Blank Space,"" which has earned an impressive eight-times platinum certification, signifying eight million equivalent units sold. Swift's ""Bad Blood,"" another Hot 100 chart-topper, is not far from “Shake It Off,” as it boasts a six-times platinum certification after moving six million equivalent units./nTwo other singles from 1989, ""Wildest Dreams"" and ""Style,"" have also reached multi-platinum status. ""Wildest Dreams"" has shifted four million equivalent units, while ""Style"" is inching closer to matching that figure, currently comfortably resting at triple platinum status./nTurning to non-single tracks from the album, two songs have earned platinum honors from the RIAA: the album opener ""Welcome to New York"" and the enchanting ""This Love,"" both of which have moved at least one million equivalent units. Sixth official single ""Out of the Woods"" is also a platinum hit for the singer—one of dozens from her discography./nFour additional songs from 1989 have received gold certifications for surpassing the 500,000 equivalent unit mark. These include ""All You Had to Do Was Stay,"" ""How You Get the Girl,"" ""I Know Places"" and ""New Romantics.""/nInterestingly, four songs from the album, including those featured on the deluxe edition, have yet to secure any certification from the RIAA.

The 29-year-old had fashioned flowery butterfly wings from a tapestry, with some sewing help from her mother-in-law, meant to emulate the Nashville mural Swift posed in front of in 2019 to promote her “Lover” album. (Don’t worry, she said, she’d take off the wings during the show so as not to block anyone’s view.)/nA Swiftie from the beginning — Walsh saw the rising star perform when Swift was a teenager at Stagecoach’s Country Music Festival in 2008 —  she said it was one of Swift’s more recent songs that had spoken to her most deeply. /n“I actually lost my husband to cancer in January 2022, so the song ‘Bigger Than the Whole Sky’ really means a lot to me,” Walsh said. “Just because it’s talking about all the possibilities that are honestly never going to get to happen./n“I just think that song speaks a lot about grief,” she said, “and things you’re missing out on when you deal [with] and go through loss.” /nBrian Rush, 36, came to the show from Koreatown with his partner of five years, Justin Thai, who turned Rush on to Swift’s music./nThe couple decided Saturday morning to splurge on floor seats, spending $3,000 to see Swift up close and (kinda) personal. /nAlthough he was dressed in a combination of “Red”- and “Lover”-era outfits — mixing Swift’s “A lot going on at the moment” T-shirt with a tie-dyed “Lover”-themed button-down — he said he’d found her “Reputation” album most powerful. /n“How she came back, in a sense, from all the negativity and everything like that,” Rush said. “We all go through that in life, when people have something to say about us.”/nMichelle Ascencio, 36, drove up for the Saturday show from Tijuana, excited to take a trip down memory lane through all the Swift eras, each of which takes her her back to a specific time in her life. Swift’s debut album reminds her of college dance parties with her girlfriends, she said, while later albums follow her adult life. /nBut it’s “Folklore” that makes her emotional. /n“When I listen to ‘Folklore,’ when I hear ‘the 1’ start playing in my head, it transports me back into time to during the pandemic,” Ascencio said of the album released in 2020. /n“There weren’t a lot of endorphins during that time; we were still in the middle of the pandemic — and I just get chills just thinking about how much joy that album brought me,” she said. “What, like, a breath of fresh air it was to hear Taylor Swift do something new./n“So ‘Folklore’ for me holds a special place because it brought me joy in a time where there wasn’t a lot [of that] going on.”/nMollie Alkazian has been a longtime Swiftie, but it wasn’t until the “Lover” album came out in 2019 that she really started to connect with the artist’s music on a personal level. She attended Saturday’s concert with friend and fellow Thousand Oaks resident Emma Jakl./n“The whole ‘Lover’ album was my first glance at her being older; she was growing up like we were,” said Alkazian, who was dressed in a “Lover”-style pink outfit complete with jewels and butterflies in her hair./nAlkazian, at 28, is a few years younger than the 33-year-old Swift, but the 2019 album’s songs about true love brought home their shared experience — “I like boys, too,” she said, laughing./nSisters Megan and Robin Vo, 23 and 25, wore contrasting white and black outfits inspired by Selena Gomez’s surprise performance with Swift on the 1989 album tour./nTheir father died around the time of the release of Swift’s second album, 2008’s “Fearless.” Since then, the sisters have scored their lives with the music of their favorite artist./n“It helped me through all my middle school crushes and heartbreak,” Robin said, naming ‘You Belong With Me’ as a particularly memorable song, mentioning her then-crush, Daniel. “And she just gets it. She knows what heartbreak is at every stage in life.”/n“‘Midnights’ helped us through med school,” Megan said, nodding to her friend and classmate Liam Bell. “We grew up with her, she grew up with us, she’s been there through every stage in life.”/nStart your day right/nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

[+] Movie World Premiere at AMC The Grove 14 on October 11, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by John Shearer/Getty Images for TAS)/nTaylor Swift's latest movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, is currently gracing theaters and is well on its way to redefining box office success for concert films. While the title is already generating positive reviews and substantial earnings, the payday for Swift is merely another addition to her long line of massively successful current commercial ventures./nIn its opening weekend alone, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour has the potential to rake in an impressive $200 million globally at the box office. But this is just the beginning. By the time the film concludes its theatrical run, it could earn millions more, potentially exceeding another $100 million. Swift and her team reportedly take home over 50% of the box office grosses, which means that the singer stands to earn well over $100 million from this movie./nFor most musicians—even the most prominent names in the industry—the prospect of earning a nine-figure paycheck for a single project would be a dream come true and a game-changer. While Swift undoubtedly appreciates the financial rewards, this particular success pales in comparison to the tour that shares its name./nThe Eras Tour is still in its early stages, and Swift has a long road ahead before she wraps up the venture. With plans to visit several more countries before the end of 2023 and dates scheduled almost until the close of 2024, Swift's earnings from this tour are expected to be bigger than anything anyone’s seen before./nAccording to a report by the Washington Post, Swift might pocket as much as 85% of the box office grosses for her tour, and when merchandise sales are factored in, her income per night soars even higher./nThe enormity of The Eras Tour is exemplified by the projections that it could bring in more than $2 billion by the conclusion of her North American dates, as reported by CNN. This is just one segment of the global tour, and she has many more shows left outside of the continent. The same Washington Post article states that Swift's total earnings from The Eras Tour could surpass $4 billion by the time it concludes./nIn comparison, while Swift is poised to achieve one of the top-grossing movies in the U.S. in 2023, the earnings from the film will still represent only a fraction of her total income that’s connected to The Eras Tour. Swift might earn more than 20 times the amount from the actual The Eras Tour than from its accompanying blockbuster movie. These figures may be speculative at this stage, but the underlying message remains clear: the Grammy-winning artist is on track to secure one of the most significant paydays in not only her career but in the entire entertainment industry./n",-2.253278949,110,Tour,1

The biggest and most popular stars are often applauded for leveraging their platforms to influence public opinion and drive change./nTaylor Swift stayed out of politics for a long time, but her tune has changed. Now, following a move by the superstar to get out the vote, one of the most prominent Democrats in the country is praising the singer for her efforts./nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom headed to Simi Valley earlier this week to appear via media at the Republican’s latest debate. While speaking with TMZ, the Democratic politician and likely one-day presidential candidate lauded Swift’s influence, stating that it could play a significant role in the upcoming 2024 presidential election./n""Taylor Swift stands tall and unique,"" remarked Governor Newsom in an interview with the celebrity-focused outlet. ""What she was able to accomplish in getting young people activated to consider that they have a voice and they should have a voice in the next election, I think it's profoundly powerful.""/nNewsom went on to further praise the “Anti-Hero” chart-topper, adding, ""I think she's using her celebrity for good.""/nNewsom is referring to Swift’s recent push to get her millions of Instagram followers to sign up to vote. On National Voter Registration Day, the Grammy winner took to her social media account to urge her fans, affectionately known as Swifities, to register to take part in the upcoming election. To do so, she shared a link to Vote.org, a non-profit voting registration platform and organization she has partnered with in the past./n""I've been so lucky to see so many of you guys at my U.S. shows recently,"" Swift's statement read. ""I've heard you raise your voices, and I know how powerful they are. Make sure you're ready to use them in our elections this year!"" It was a simple message, but one that resulted in a massive spike in visits to the website. The Wrap reports that the organization saw a more than 1,200% jump in traffic following her post./nDuring the short chat with TMZ, Newsom also noted that not everyone shares this sentiment of Swift’s move to get young people to take part in the democratic process. ""Republicans are critical of her encouraging people to register to vote,” he stated, adding, “which says everything you need to know about the voter suppression going on in the Republican party.""/nSwift's engagement in the political space is not a recent development. In recent years, she has become increasingly vocal about her political beliefs, endorsing candidates and advocating for issues that matter to her. For the first decade or so of her career, she steered clear of such topics, but eventually she felt the need to speak up, and since then has supported a handful of Democrat candidates./n",2.287775384,111,Social impact,1

Politicians asked her to postpone her concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers. Scalped tickets were going for $3,000 and up. And there were way, way too many friendship bracelets to count./nThese days, the center of an otherwise splintered music world can only be Taylor Swift./nThe pop superstar’s tour, which is now finishing its initial North American leg with six nights at SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles, has been both a business and a cultural juggernaut. Swift’s catalog of generation-defining hits and canny marketing sense have helped her achieve a level of white-hot demand and media saturation not seen since the 1980s heyday of Michael Jackson and Madonna — a dominance that the entertainment business had largely accepted as impossible to replicate in the fragmented 21st century./n“The only thing I can compare it to is the phenomenon of Beatlemania,” said Billy Joel, who attended Swift’s show in Tampa, Fla., with his wife and young daughters./nIn a summer of tours by stars like Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Morgan Wallen and Drake, Swift’s stands apart, in numbers and in media noise. Although Swift, 33, and her promoters do not publicly report box-office figures, the trade publication Pollstar estimated that she has been selling about $14 million in tickets each night. By the end of the full world tour, which is booked with 146 stadium dates well into 2024, Swift’s sales could reach $1.4 billion or more — exceeding Elton John’s $939 million for his multiyear farewell tour, the current record-holder./nSwift has now had more No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 over the course of her career than any other woman, surpassing Barbra Streisand. With the tour lifting Swift’s entire body of work, she has placed 10 albums on that chart this year and is the first living artist since the trumpeter and bandleader Herb Alpert in 1966 to have four titles in the Top 10 at the same time./n“It’s a pretty amazing feat,” Alpert, 88, said in a phone interview. “With the way radio is these days, and the way music is distributed, with streaming, I didn’t think anyone in this era could do it.”/nBut how did a concert tour become so much more: fodder for gossip columns, the subject of weather reports, a boon for friendship-bracelet beads — the unofficial currency of Swiftie fandom — and the reason nobody could get a hotel room in Cincinnati at the end of June?/n“She is the best C.E.O., and best chief marketing officer, in the history of music,” said Nathan Hubbard, a longtime music and ticketing executive who co-hosts a Swift podcast. “She is following people like Bono, Jay-Z and Madonna, who were acutely aware of their brands. But of all of them, Taylor is the first one to be natively online.”/nSwifties have chronicled the stream of celebrity fans who have turned up each night: Julia Roberts, the New York Jets’ new quarterback Aaron Rodgers, even Flavor Flav of Public Enemy. But Swift has also made each show a news event by adding two “surprise songs,” often with headline-grabbing guests. On the July day that she put out a music video featuring Taylor Lautner, an ex-boyfriend, the actor backflipped across the stage in Kansas City, Mo., and paid Swift effusive tribute — “not just for the singer you are,” Lautner said, “but for the human you are.” The crowd registered its approval with an earsplitting roar./nThe Taylorpalooza extends to every level of the news media, which began the coverage cycle by chronicling Swift’s ticketing fiasco last November, when fans — and scalpers’ bots — crushed Ticketmaster’s systems, leading to a heated Senate Judiciary hearing. Since then, seemingly no nugget of Swift news has escaped coverage, from the stars in the stands to oddities like a Seattle concert that, according to one researcher, shook the ground with an intensity equivalent to a 2.3-magnitude earthquake./nMusic critics have portrayed the Eras Tour as showing Swift at the top of her game as a media-savvy, big-tent talent, a pop star with a knack for grand spectacle as well as the polished artistry of a classic songwriter./nShania Twain, the country-pop star whose career in some ways prefigured Swift’s, caught the Las Vegas stop of the Eras Tour, a 44-plus song production that goes as long as three and a half hours. She praised Swift’s “beautiful balance” of high-tech stagecraft and intimate performance segments. “I have to applaud her,” Twain said in a telephone interview. “As a performer, I know that work that goes into it.”/nThe power of Swift’s fan army — and fear of crossing the star, or even appearing to — has kept nearly all of the press about the tour sunny. Though some fans (and parents) balked at the ticket prices and challenges of securing seats, most frustration was directed squarely at Ticketmaster, not Swift. After a few weeks of headlines romantically linking Swift with a frontman some fans considered to be problematic, reports spread in the celebrity pages that they had split. (Swift’s representatives declined to comment for this article.)/nFor fans, the shows are a pilgrimage, and a rediscovery of the joys of mass gatherings. Flights are packed with Swifties, and travelers trade stories and compare outfits — drawn from looks associated with Swift “eras” — in stadium corridors and parking lots. In Kansas City, the comedian Nikki Glaser was attending her eighth show, a commitment that she estimated has cost her $25,000./n“This year I decided not to freeze my eggs,” Glaser said. “I’m going to put that money toward the thing I love most in the world, which is Taylor Swift.”/nBefore Eras, Swift hadn’t been on tour since 2018. And her catalog has grown by seven No. 1 albums since then, fueled in part by three rerecorded “Taylor’s Versions” of her first LPs — a project hailed by Swift’s fans as a crusade to regain control of her music, though it is also an act of revenge after the sale of Swift’s former record label, a move that, she said, “stripped me of my life’s work.”/n“Folklore” and “Evermore” expanded her palate into fantastical indie-folk and brought new collaborators into the fold: Aaron Dessner from the band the National and Justin Vernon, a.k.a. Bon Iver, rock-world figures who helped attract new listeners./nThe other major tour this year that is enticing fans to book transcontinental flights, and to show up costumed and in rapture, is also by a woman: Beyoncé, 41, whose Renaissance tour is a fantasia of disco and retrofuturism. Like Swift, she is also a trailblazing artist-entrepreneur, maintaining tight control over her career and fostering a rich connection with fans online. Together with Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” a critique of the patriarchy told in hot pink, they are signs of powerful women ruling the discourse of pop culture./nBut in music, at least, the scale and success of Swift’s tour is without equal. Later this month, after completing 53 shows in the United States, she will kick off an international itinerary of at least 78 more before returning to North America next fall. Beyoncé’s full tour has 56 dates; Springsteen’s, 90. (Recently, Harry Styles wrapped a 173-date tour in arenas and stadiums, grossing about $590 million.)/nOutside Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, fans posed for selfies and shared their ticketing ordeals. Esmeralda Tinoco and Sami Cytron, 24-year-old former sorority sisters, said they had paid $645 for two seats. A stone’s throw away, Karlee Patrick and Emily DeGruson, both 18 and dressed as a pair in angel/devil costumes after a line in Swift’s “Cruel Summer,” sat “Taylorgating” at the edge of the parking lot; they said they had paid $100 for parking but couldn’t afford tickets./nAs Swift’s opening acts finished, the crowd rushed in. Glaser, the comedian, later said that of the eight shows she had been to, her favorites were the ones where she had brought her mother — and converted her to Swiftie fandom./n“Everyone is in love with her,” Glaser said her mom told her after one show in Texas. “Now I get it.”/nBen Sisario covers the music industry.

With 1,287,000 sales in the United States, it was the biggest start for any album in more than a decade, and affirmed Swift as a megaselling force./nSince then, Swift has scored eight more No. 1 albums. But incredibly, she has now topped the first-week total of her original “1989” with a remake of the same LP. It starts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with the equivalent of 1,653,000 sales in the United States — the biggest opening sales week of Swift’s career — and 3.5 million around the world, according to Republic Records, her label. It is the biggest debut for any album since Adele’s “25” eight years ago, which started with nearly 3.4 million in the U.S., a number that remains unsurpassed./n“1989 (Taylor’s Version)” is Swift’s 13th No. 1 album, and her sixth to have more than a million sales in a single week — more than any other artist since at least 1991, when Billboard’s charts were first based on reliable sales data. It also caps an extraordinary year for the pop star, who has saturated nearly every corner of popular culture./nThe new “1989” is Swift’s third title to reach No. 1 in 2023, after an expanded version of her last studio album, “Midnights” (2022), returned to the top spot in June; “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version),” the last installment in her project to rerecord her first six studio albums — an effort to reclaim her music after the sale of her former record label — arrived in July. Her Eras Tour has been a record-breaking phenomenon, expected to gross well over $1 billion in ticket sales by its finale next year. Her movie “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” released last month, easily became the biggest concert film of all time. And let’s not even get into how Swift has lifted N.F.L. television ratings./nWhen the original “1989” came out, it was not available on streaming services. Swift was then one of a number of prominent holdouts who kept her music off the new format, over concerns about its financial model. Since then, of course, streaming has taken over the music business, and Swift has long since made her music available on all major platforms. But “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” still outperformed the original in old-fashioned sales, thanks in part to her canny marketing of collectible physical media — a strategy now widely used across the pop world, but perhaps most effectively by Swift, the rapper Travis Scott and an array of K-pop acts./nOf the 1,653,000 “equivalent album units” attributed to the new “1989” — a composite number that Billboard and its data partner, Luminate, use to reconcile sales and streams — 1,359,000 were for sales of albums, surpassing the total for the original “1989.” The new album sold 693,000 copies on vinyl, the largest week of sales for that format since at least 1991. It also surpasses Swift’s own vinyl record of 575,000 for “Midnights,” a year ago./n“1989 (Taylor’s Version)” sold 554,000 copies on CD, the biggest weekly number on that format since Adele’s “25.” According to Billboard, the new “1989” was available in 15 versions on physical formats, including five colored vinyl variants, eight CDs and two cassettes./nIn addition, “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” had 375 million streams, the most in a single week for any of Swift’s four rerecorded albums./nAlso this week, the K-pop ensemble Seventeen opens at No. 2 with “Seventeenth Heaven,” an eight-track release that the group calls its 11th “mini-album,” which sold 98,000 copies on CD. Drake’s “For All the Dogs” is No. 3, Bad Bunny’s “Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana” is No. 4 and Morgan Wallen’s “One Thing at a Time” holds at No. 5./nBen Sisario covers the music industry.

I think the Internet right now is going insane.”/nAnd it did, especially after Mahomes hit Kelce for a third-quarter touchdown to make it 41-0 and Swift was seeing shouting a profanity in excitement./nIn July, Kelce appeared on the New Heights podcast to say he had made a bracelet for Swift and hoped to give it to her in person when she performed at Arrowhead, but the singer was on vocal rest and wasn’t taking visitors./nNow he got to showcase his skills in front of her on his home turf./nSwift’s Eras Tour resumes Oct. 18 in Miami, while Kelce and the Chiefs next play at the Jets next Sunday night in a nationally televised game./n",0,114,Dating,0

[+] on December 10, 2015 in Melbourne, Australia.  (Photo by Graham Denholm/Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift recently announced her upcoming re-recording, 1989 (Taylor’s Version), much to the delight of her massive fan base. The singer revealed the album cover and release date, October 27, during a momentous performance during her ongoing The Eras Tour. Since this much-anticipated revelation, fans across the country have flocked to revisit the original 1989, propelling its iconic songs to dominate Spotify's charts./n14 tracks from the original 1989 have swiftly surged onto Spotify's list of the most-streamed songs in the U.S. This remarkable presence marks a substantial increase from the prior day, when legions of Swifties eagerly anticipated the thrilling announcement had already started streaming the familiar cuts from the album./nNearly every gem from the 1989 era makes its presence felt on the chart, with numerous tracks either making their debut or reaching previously unknown heights. The numbers reported below are as of Friday, August 11./nSix 1989 tracks soar to new peaks following the announcement. Spearheading this resurgence is “Style” which rises 20 spots to settle at a new peak of No. 8. ""Blank Space"" comes next and isn’t far behind, surging an impressive 25 places to settle at No. 12, narrowly missing the coveted top 10 nearly a decade after its initial release./nOther chart-climbing hits include ""Shake It Off,"" which ascends a staggering 117 positions to land at No. 34. ""Out of the Woods"" ventures to a noteworthy new peak of No. 41, while ""Bad Blood"" shoots to No. 57. ""Wildest Dreams"" reappears at No. 63, and the anthem ""Welcome to New York"" achieves its best chart position yet at No. 82./nImmediately after announcing 1989 (Taylor’s Version), Swift performed the song ""New Romantics,"" a bonus track on the original 1989. That attention has helped the tune score an impressive debut on the Spotify U.S. chart, starting at No. 31. This win represents the highest-ranking new entry from the superstar, but it is far from the only one./nAn array of fellow 1989-era melodies, including ""All You Had to Do Was Stay,"" ""I Wish You Would,"" ""Clean,"" ""How You Get the Girl,"" ""I Know Places,"" ""Wonderland"" and ""You Are in Love,"" all claim their rightful spots on the chart for the first time. These tracks, spurred by the excitement of the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) announcement, have enjoyed a meteoric resurgence in popularity, hitting the tally for the first time, as their heyday was largely before the ranking was popular./nThe sheer magnitude of the news and the excitement felt by Swift’s fanbase have also breathed new life into a familiar tune. The re-released version of ""Wildest Dreams,"" aptly renamed ""Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version),"" had previously graced this prestigious ranking, and its return at No. 151 reflects the insatiable energy surrounding Swift's announcement./nBeyond the dozen-plus streaming sensations from 1989, Swift's presence is felt all across Spotify's 200-spot chart. In fact, that album doesn’t even make up half of the tunes she has on the tally./n""Cruel Summer"" holds at its No. 2 position, proving itself to still be a streaming giant. A collection of beloved hits spanning multiple albums—including Lover, Reputation, Fearless (Taylor’s Version), and the recent Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)—all find space as well, ranking as among the most-streamed in America./n",1.283791639,115,Discography,1

On the album chart, Bad Bunny debuts at the top./nBy Ben Sisario/nFour years ago, Taylor Swift included the song “Cruel Summer” on her album “Lover.” It became a fan favorite, and had been in line to be released as a single in 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic changed all plans. “That is something that happened that stopped ‘Cruel Summer’ from ever being a single,” the singer said a few months ago./nBut this year, Swift played the song on her record-breaking Eras Tour, and it was belatedly given the proper promotional push. After breaking into the Top 10 in July, “Cruel Summer” has finally made it to No. 1, becoming Swift’s 10th track to top Billboard’s Hot 100 chart./nOver the last week, Swift went all out to promote it. She discounted the track for digital sales and released an EP containing a remix and a live version, “so we can all shriek it in the comfort of our homes and cars,” as she announced on social media./nLast week, “Cruel Summer” had nearly 19 million streams in the United States, sold 41,000 downloads — up from around 2,500 the week before — and had 78 million “airplay audience impressions,” a measurement of a song’s popularity at radio, according to the tracking service Luminate./nOn this week’s album chart, Bad Bunny sailed to the top with his latest album, “Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana” (“Nobody Knows What Will Happen Tomorrow”), which the Puerto Rican superstar released on Oct. 13 with just a few days’ notice. The album, his third to reach No. 1, opened with the equivalent of 184,000 sales in the United States, including 240 million streams and 7,500 download sales, according to Luminate./nBad Bunny, who was the host and musical guest on “Saturday Night Live” over the weekend, released “Un Verano Sin Ti” last year — a surprise, like “Nadie Sabe” — and it went on to top the Billboard album chart 13 times; he was also the world’s top touring artist in 2022./nBad Bunny’s success bumps Drake to second place after one week at No. 1 with “For All the Dogs.” Also this week, the K-pop quintet Tomorrow X Together opens at No. 3 with “The Name Chapter: Freefall,” which sold 106,000 copies as a complete package and drew about 12 million clicks on streaming services./nZach Bryan’s self-titled LP is No. 4, and “Set It Off” by Offset, of the Atlanta rap trio Migos, opens in fifth place./nBen Sisario covers the music industry.

122,Calum Marsh,How Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour Was Turned Into a Movie,Movies like “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” rely on savvy tricks and sophisticated techniques to capture a semblance of the live experience.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/movies/transforming-concerts-into-films.html,The New York Times,entertainment,us,2023-10-13T09:02:46+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,122,"Advertisement/nSupported by/nMovies like “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” rely on savvy tricks and sophisticated techniques to capture a semblance of the live experience./nBy Calum Marsh/nTaylor Swift’s globe-spanning Eras Tour is one of the musical events of the year, drawing record-breaking crowds and making headlines the world over since it kicked off in Glendale, Ariz., in March. Rabid demand has made procuring a ticket notoriously difficult, if not practically impossible. But starting Friday, Swifties will have a more accessible opportunity to catch a glimpse of the live phenomenon, when the concert film “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is released by AMC Theaters — a moviegoing event that is widely expected to be a box office smash./nFilmed over three nights in August at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., and directed by Sam Wrench, “The Eras Tour,” like most concert films, aims to capture some of the magic of seeing the artist perform live. “The main thing we’re trying to do is provide the theatrical audience with the best seat in the house,” John Ross, the rerecording mixer on “The Eras Tour” and a veteran of many other hit concert films, including Jonathan Demme’s “Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids,” said by phone. “If you were to attend a concert and get the premium seat, that’s my job, to convey that image sonically and situationally.”/nBut capturing a live performance is not as straightforward as simply setting up some cameras and microphones and recording what transpires onstage. The demands of a film are incredibly complicated, and faithfully reproducing the look and sound of a concert for the screen is an arduous and painstaking process for the filmmakers and their crews. It’s a delicate proposition — a proposition some filmmakers believe is inherently doomed./n“The idea itself, to film a concert, is a bad idea,” said Jonas Akerlund, a film and music video director who made the concert movies “On the Run Tour: Beyoncé and Jay-Z Live” and “Taylor Swift: The 1989 World Tour Live.”/nHe explained, “It will never, ever be as good as the live experience. It’s basically like trying to film fireworks — everybody knows that seeing it live is not the same as seeing it on a TV screen.” But, Akerlund added, the concert film can have value, if looked at in a different way. “You can make it an equally good experience, but it has to be a filmic or cinematic experience rather than trying to compete with the live experience.”/nThe secret to cinematic merit, he said, is having the time and means to shoot it like a proper movie. That means hiring upward of 40 camera operators; shooting over multiple nights; deploying drones, Spidercams and GoPros; and setting aside a separate dress rehearsal day, when the artist plays without a crowd to shoot extra footage, like close-ups that might not have been possible during the live show. All of the footage is assembled in the editing room “with the precision of a four-minute music video” to create the illusion that what you’re seeing was unfolding in real time. “I guess it’s cheating a little bit,” Akerlund said./nThese kinds of cheats are common and, to hear filmmakers tell it, necessary. When the “Crazy Rich Asians” director Jon M. Chu made “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,” he shot the performance and the audience on separate nights, then edited them together because that, paradoxically, made the audience’s reaction feel more authentic. “I always love concert films where it feels like the audience is really there,” he said. But because of the cameras, the sound recording equipment and the lighting, “audiences don’t react as big” as they would on an ordinary night. “You try to emulate what it feels like,” he said./nOne of the most surprising things about the making of concert films is just how much tends to be emulated, even simulated, rather than merely captured as is. The actual sound of music being played live in an arena can’t merely be taped: “just a recording of the room would be useless,” Ross said. Instead, dozens of microphones — sometimes more than 100 for larger sites — record the vocals, instruments and crowd on separate tracks, and a rerecording mixer carefully blends them together, adding reverb and echo to simulate the sound of the space./nIn other words, the tone of the room is essentially applied like a filter to the raw sounds recorded from the artist onstage. This filter, known as impulse response, takes readings from actual physical places, then “synthetically reproduces the sound of a real space like a club or stadium,” said Jake Davis, the lead mix engineer at SeisMic Sound, an audio facility in Nashville that specializes in concert films./nMixers like Jake and his father, Tom Davis, the SeisMic founder, have a lot of control over the sound in a concert film, and making adjustments is a large part of their job. Some are minor refinements. Others are more like corrections: They make the concert film sound more like what the artist wanted than what necessarily occurred on the night it was filmed. “When you lock something down for a DVD or for streaming or whatever it is, once it’s done, it lives forever,” Tom Davis said. “It never goes away. So you kind of want it to be as good as it can be.”/nMixers can blend parts of a song recorded on one night with parts from another night to create the best combined version. They can fix an errant flat note in a guitar solo by manipulating it in postproduction, or they can ask an artist to rerecord a weak vocal in a studio, layering it into the mix so that it sounds as if it had been delivered live. “We copy, cut and paste, like you do on a word processor,” Davis said. “If there was a little clam in the first chorus, but he did it fine in the second chorus in the same part, we can cut and paste that. We can do vocal maintenance. We can fix a little pitch issue, or bend a note a little bit.”/nAlthough sound mixers record the crowd with a bevy of microphones hidden around the arena, it’s possible — and indeed, common — to exaggerate the sound of that audience, to artificially give the cheering fans some extra kick. “It’s kind of a dirty secret,” Davis said. “But the sound of the real audience is weak. It’s not enough. You end up adding to it, pumping it up. There’s something psychological to hearing other humans having a good time and reacting — it’s like a sitcom and a laugh track.” Jake Davis said that the ideal balance is to “start with the real reaction” and then simply “make it bigger and more obvious.”/nOf course, part of the appeal of a live show, even on film, is the impression of reality, and a sense of truth is critical. “The goal of the mix is to enhance the energy of the performance that exists as it went down in the best way possible,” Jake Davis said. “You maintain some element of rawness while taking out things that are distracting, the nuances of a wrong note or a background singer being a little bit off.”/nWhile the film version strives to be “as good as it can be for the rest of history,” he said, “there’s a fine line between correcting something a little bit and making it perfect, because it’s not going to be perfect live.” It’s a bit like touching up a portrait in Photoshop: it’s tempting to clear blemishes, but too much airbrushing can make you look fake./nPaul Dugdale, the director of “Shawn Mendes: Live in Concert” and “Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour,” said that while some live shows might lend themselves to “maximum authenticity” as an approach, other huge pop concerts don’t emphasize the authentic in the same way. “For shows that are quite theatrical, there’s a level of artifice — they’ve got screens, they’ve got pyrotechnics, they’ve got costumes, all that kind of stuff,” he said. “For someone like Taylor, I think that allows you to explore further in terms of camera angles and putting the audience in different positions.”/nA Swift concert, Dugdale pointed out, can last more than three hours, which affords the director more latitude in how to approach the film formally. “You can create texture just like the live show has texture,” he said. “Sometimes you can go heavy-handed with the director’s hand, and sometimes you can completely let go of the steering wheel and let the artist take over.”/nDespite the high level of difficulty, the job for filmmakers and sound engineers is quite thankless. The best concert films will, to the unwitting viewer, seem like nothing more than filmed concerts — the filmmaking itself remains invisible./n“The goal is that you don’t want people thinking about the fact that this was worked on or changed at all from what it was live,” Jake Davis told me. “You just want the audience to be immersed in the experience and to accept that it’s happening in front of them — to feel like they’re there.” /nBut Dugdale noted that however much he tries to plan out a concert shoot, the live aspect will always prove unpredictable. “Making these films, you can be as prepared as you can possibly be, but in the end you have to hold on for dear life and see how it turns out.”/nAdvertisement",0,122,Filmography,0

He said on the New Heights podcast he'd made a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it to give to Swift after seeing an Era's Tour performance, but never got to give it to her. The speculation only grew last week when Kelce told The Pat McAfee Show he'd invited her to a game. Commentators had fun with the rumors last weekend, the week before she made her Arrowhead Stadium appearance, with NFL Network anchor Rich Eisen joking Kelce “proves to be the anti-hero” and “never goes out of style.” Fans took her appearance as confirmation of the dating rumors—Swift watched from a suite alongside Kelce’s mom, Donna, and appeared to yell “let’s f*cking go” after Kelce scored a touchdown. After the game, Swift and Kelce were seen driving away together in his convertible, reportedly headed to a restaurant Kelce rented out for a private party after the game./nIn the time since the Swift appearance, fans, brands, Kansas City landmarks and even the NFL itself have jumped on the bandwagon.

The NFL changed the bio on its official X account to ""NFL (Taylor's Version).” Several memes have gone viral of Swift fans admitting they’re now interested in football for the first time, and the jacket named for Swift’s “1989” album that Kelce was seen wearing after the game has since sold out. A new TikTok trend has gone viral that sees Swifties asking their boyfriends, “Isn’t it crazy that Taylor Swift put Travis Kelce on the map?” Kelce has won two Super Bowls and been named first-team All-Pro four times./n400%.

In a somewhat wishy-washy answer -- she appears to say, that's not the case./nWhen asked if her single, ""vampire,"" was aimed at Taylor, she says ... ""I mean, I never want to say who any of my songs are about. I’ve never done that before in my career and probably won’t. I think it’s better to not pigeonhole a song to being about this one thing.""/nOlivia adds, ""I was very surprised when people thought that.""

""'Cause I've made some real big mistakes / But you make the worst one look fine / I should've known it was strange / You only come out at night / I used to think I was smart / But you made me look so naive / The way you sold me for parts / As you sunk your teeth into me, oh / Bloodsucker, famef***er/ Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire.""/nWaiting for your permission to load TikTok Post./nMany took these lines to be referencing the plagiarism scandal Olivia found herself in after her first album, 'Sour,' got released. As you know, she ended up having to pay both Taylor and Paramore royalties after they flagged similarities in a couple of her songs to her team./nAs it turns out ... the amount she had to shell out for those two songs amounted to 50%, according to The Guardian. Many felt Olivia was done dirty in that whole saga, and those same people believed she was expressing her frustration to TayTay in that new single./nLike we said, it certainly seems like Olivia is distancing herself from that characterization -- but the fact she doesn't firmly stamp it out in clear terms is ... interesting, to say the least./nOlivia reflected on that chapter, saying ... ""I was so green as to how the music industry worked, the litigious side … I feel like now I know so much more about the industry and I just feel … better equipped in that regard. It wasn’t something I thought about too much.""/nEven here, there's a tone of resentment over the fact she was gouged by well-established artists, way bigger than her at the time.

By the time Swift’s picture is done in theaters, it will surely rank as the most successful performance release ever./nWhat competition does Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour face on its way to making history in this manner?/nCurrently, the record for the highest-grossing concert movie of all time belongs to Michael Jackson's This Is It. Released in the wake of his untimely passing, the concert film and documentary provided an intimate look at the legendary artist's preparations for a tour that was set to be his final trek. By the time it concluded its theatrical run, This Is It had amassed an astounding $261 million at the box office./nThis Is It stands as the only concert movie to break the $100 million mark at the box office, a feat that has yet to be surpassed. However, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour set new records by raking in at least $100 million in advance ticket sales, so Jackson’s milestone is about to be officially beaten./nIn the second spot for highest-grossing concert films is Justin Bieber's Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, which was released in 2011. The young pop star’s movie earned just over $99 million worldwide, coming very close to that $100 million milestone./nMiley Cyrus, who was also known as Hannah Montana at the time, lands in third place with Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert. The 2008 release brought in a little under $71 million at the box office, setting a record until Jackson's This Is It surpassed it several times over the following year./nRounding out the top five in the musical concert film category are One Direction: This Is Us, with $68 million in box office earnings, and Katy Perry: Part of Me, which grossed $32.7 million./nAn honorary mention goes to K-pop sensation BTS, whose BTS Permission to Dance on Stage - Seoul: Live Viewing also achieved box office success. That title missed out on tying Perry’s total by just $100,000./nThis ranking changes when comedy performances are taken into account. Films featuring comedians such as Eddie Murphy, Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac, along with the legendary Richard Pryor, have also proven to be box office hits. While these films aren't traditional concerts, they are categorized as performance films and sometimes included in rankings alongside musical concert films./nAs Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour continues its impressive theatrical run, projections suggest that it could make as much as $200 million in its opening weekend. By the time it departs from theaters, the total earnings may grow by tens of millions of dollars, if not another $100 million./n",8.986541474,135,Filmography,1

The Brazilian pop star Anitta delivered one of the event’s most solid one-liners — “I want to thank myself because I worked so hard,” she said in an acceptance speech — which she also proved onstage, performing both a solo medley and a collaboration with the K-pop group Tomorrow X Together. At the end of the night, the following five moments stood out./nOne of pop-rap’s most unpredictable voices turned out the night’s most polished and high-concept performance, capturing the anxiety of return to office in a look perhaps best described as “business sexual” while surrounded by dancers doused in ghoulish red paint. The audience looked confused and a little terrified as Doja Cat glided around the stage nailing her marks, the calm in an increasingly hectic storm./nOlivia Rodrigo’s “Vampire” video dramatizes an awards show performance gone wrong, and though it has 54 million YouTube views, none of those evidently came from V.M.A.s audience members like Selena Gomez, who looked stricken when Rodrigo partly recreated the clip Tuesday night. After the song’s first section, lights seemingly burst onstage and a curtain fell as a “stagehand” ushered the singer away — only to return seconds later grinning and performing another song from her new album, “Guts,” the bouncy “Get Him Back!”/nCardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s first televised performance of their hit “WAP” came at the 2021 Grammys, and their salacious choreography caught the attention of over 1,000 viewers who complained to the Federal Communications Commission, Rolling Stone reported. The duo reunited last week with a fresh collaboration called “Bongos,” and played it relatively safer on the V.M.A.s stage. The censors caught most of the profanities and the audience camera caught one of the night’s many shots of Swift dancing along./nPerforming a mega medley to celebrate receiving the video vanguard award, the Colombian pop star didn’t appear to be doing much live singing, but her lengthy number included plenty of choreography, hair flipping, microphone stand tossing, guitar playing, a quick wardrobe adjustment, crowd surfing and a lift bringing her high above the crowd. But a truly eye-grabbing moment came halfway through, when she wielded two knives, dramatically running one across her torso before tossing them aside./nThe Grammys went big with a tribute to 50 years of hip-hop earlier this year, but MTV’s celebration of rap’s anniversary had some highlights, too: After Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Slick Rick and Doug E.

Her most recent re-recording, Speak Now (Taylor's Version), debuted with 507,000 copies sold this summer.

(Photo by Sarah Morris/FilmMagic)/nLater this week, Taylor Swift will officially descend onto theaters around the world with her concert movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The film is apparently a showing of a date (or more likely, several) on her The Eras Tour, which is on its way to becoming the highest-grossing trek of all time. Everyone is focused on this exciting new project from the superstar, but not much has been heard about another movie she’s attached to–one that was supposed to see her trying out some new skills./nIn December 2022, it was revealed that Swift had written an original script for a narrative full-length feature, the first of her career. The singer had reportedly signed with Searchlight Pictures to work on her movie, which is a good partner, as the company has been behind some major critical darlings, like Best Picture winners The Shape of Water and Nomadland./nSwift reportedly not only wrote the movie, the title of which was never shared publicly, but she aims to direct it as well. The superstar has spent years directing her own music videos to much success and acclaim, and she is looking to have her talents in that department taken seriously in another field./nIt was major news when this story broke in late 2022, but in the months since then, nothing has been heard about this project. Swift has been incredibly busy throughout 2023, as she’s been traveling the country (and then parts of Central America) on her The Eras Tour. The trek has been immensely popular and a commercial juggernaut, and she has dates lined up into next November./nOn top of her historic tour, Swift has also released a re-recorded album, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), which included a new music video and which went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. As if that wasn’t enough music for fans, she has another one coming at the end of the month, 1989 (Taylor’s Version)./nIt’s unclear if Swift has found time in between tour dates and studio sessions to work on her movie. She likely has to do a lot of rewrites on her script, which are common in the movie industry. Even if it was 100% finished, a director needs to set aside a lot of time for meetings, calls, casting, and more–all the things associated with making a film. It seems impossible that she’s been able to do much of that work in 2023, as she’s simply been too busy./nSo far, it appears that no updates have been given about this Swift movie. Whether that’s because all the work is actually happening behind the scenes, or perhaps because nothing has changed in the past several months, is unclear. It’s interesting that as the promise of her own movie seems to fade further and further into the past, the Grammy winner is about to dominate the global box office./n",4.647625671,140,Filmography,1

I love her because she’s getting young people out to vote so I don’t want her to be stuck with this idiot.”/nBut this didn’t sway anyone onto her side. Instead, Alyssa Farah Griffin, who noted that Travis’ comments were “not appropriate,” asked Joy to give the athlete some “grace” considering his generation was first to be introduced to social media through their teen and adult lives — frequenting the platforms before it became obvious not to post certain things, she dished:/n“We documented everything. … You gotta give people a little grace and hope that the way he treats women now is reflective of how he is as an adult.”/nHis tweets definitely aren’t great, but at least they’re not racist, homophobic, and whatnot!

[+] 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)/nTaylor Swift has been experimenting with her promotional efforts throughout 2023, releasing several singles simultaneously from different albums. Surprisingly, this risky marketing strategy has paid off beautifully, as she accomplishes a feat that only a few musicians have achieved on one of Billboard's competitive radio charts./nThis frame, Swift secures three spots inside the top 10 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, a weekly ranking that highlights tracks reaching the largest radio audience among stations labeling themselves as adult contemporary. Essentially, the chart showcases the most popular songs fitting that genre description based on their radio airplay./nInterestingly, Swift's highest-ranking hit on the Adult Contemporary chart is the oldest among her selections. ""Anti-Hero"" maintains its No. 2 position, a remarkable feat for a track that has spent a considerable time on the tally. Released in late 2022, the song swiftly climbed to No. 1, marking another major success for Swift. Now, it’s just one rung shy of ruling again./nThis week, ""Anti-Hero"" misses out on another turn at the No. 1 spot to Miley Cyrus's ""Flowers,"" which has dominated the tally for an impressive 21 weeks. Both songs stand as relatively old contenders on the chart in terms of radio rankings./nLifting to a new high this week, ""Cruel Summer"" rises to No. 8 on the Adult Contemporary chart, up from No. 9 in the previous period. The electro-pop track hails from Swift's 2019 album Lover, and its unexpected success as a radio hit, long after its initial release, is worthy or highlighting./nJust two positions further down the Adult Contemporary chart, another Swift song makes an appearance. ""Karma,"" the singer's third official single from Midnights, keeps at the No. 10 position, continuing its presence in the top 10. Interestingly, while the song was initially released as a duet with rapper Ice Spice, it's the original solo version that charts on the Adult Contemporary tally. The tune previously climbed as high as No. 9./nAchieving a top 10 position on any of Billboard's radio charts is no easy feat for any artist. Garnering multiple wins from an album is impressive, and accomplishing this simultaneously underscores a star's status. While Swift's trio of concurrent placements within the highly competitive region might not be unprecedented, it's a milestone that only the industry's biggest players can manage. Such a feat also requires a unique set of circumstances, as stiff competition can challenge even the most prominent musicians./n",3.847312268,146,Achievements,1

Many suggested online that since it was being released in theaters, it was eligible, with some opining that it might end up in the running in the Best Documentary Feature field...but it turns out that competing for the biggest prize in the movie world isn’t quite so easy./nAccording to the rules set down by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the organization that hands out the Oscars each year (and pointed out by The Wrap), Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour already appears to be ineligible for at least most of the awards given out./nOne section of the guidelines the focuses on what can be entered for contention and what can’t stipulates that, “Works that are essentially promotional or instructional are not eligible, nor are works that are essentially unfiltered records of performances.” This makes it pretty clear that Swift won’t be winning any gold for this film, at least not in most categories./nIt’s been well-known that Swift has been working toward an Oscar nomination for many years. She’s appeared in films, though never earned enough praise to be seriously in the running for an acting prize. In 2022, she hit the ground running to shake hands and meet voters in an attempt to snag a nomination for her music video All Too Well: The Short Film, which she directed. She was hoping to land in the Best Live Action Short Film category, but she didn’t end up a nominee./nSwift has also been attempting to collect a Best Original Song Oscar nomination for quite some time, but somehow, she has failed to do so. She has been up for the same prize at the Golden Globes on four separate occasions, but none of those nods have translated to the Academy Awards. The superstar is already a 12-time Grammy winner and 46-time nominee, and she’s also won an Emmy./nWhile Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour won’t earn Taylor Swift an Oscar nomination—or at least that’s how it seems—it’s sure to make her an even richer woman. The movie reportedly brought in at least $26 million in ticket sales on the first day of pre-sales, and it’s just getting started.

Thankfully, the set is coming soon, as the album is scheduled to drop on October 27. One thing seems almost certain: 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is poised to claim the coveted No. 1 spot on the prestigious Billboard 200 chart./nThroughout her career, Swift has exhibited an extraordinary track record of chart-topping success on the Billboard 200. Since her second album, Fearless, debuted atop the tally in 2008, every subsequent musical endeavor she has shared with the world has soared to No. 1 on this all-encompassing ranking of album consumption in the U.S./nSwift has already amassed an impressive collection of 12 chart-toppers, a feat that includes her recent re-releases of re-recordings.

The elite club of artists who have achieved this feat includes iconic names like Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Elton John, Garth Brooks, and even the cast of the beloved TV show Glee./nSwift is no chart supremacy and in fact, she previously achieved the distinction of securing three No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 in a single year. Her historic run unfolded in 2021, when her album Evermore kicked off the year as the first No. 1. Throughout the remainder of the year, her re-recorded versions of Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and Red (Taylor’s Version) both ascended to the summit as well./nAs the world eagerly awaits the debut of 1989 (Taylor’s Version), the question of its eventual impact looms large, and the album's potential to make a monumental splash upon its release is undeniable. With Swift's history of blockbuster numbers, the possibility of a debut with more than half a million units, and even potentially nearing the million mark, is well within reach./nThe certainty of 1989 (Taylor’s Version) opening at the summit of the charts is nearly beyond dispute (as nothing is certain until it happens), so now her fans only need to wait to see the final number of just how huge the reworked pop opus will be./n",0.174015013,154,Achievements,1

Fine, go ahead and rent a limo./nBut if money really means nothing to you, well, you can take a Taylor Swift helicopter shuttle, just $2,499 for – let’s double check this, wow, OK – a one-way trip./nAds for IEX Helicopters’ Eras Tour shuttles started popping up on Instagram recently, promising “the swiftest ride” to the shows, because nothing – not congressional hearings, not news stories, not advertisements – can mention Taylor Swift without making at least one (usually) bad Swift-related pun./nHere, we’ll show you how anyone can force a Swift reference into an otherwise ordinary news story:/nThe shuttles are available from any airport in Los Angeles and Orange County. Just as Taylor sang, “Flew me to places I’d never been,” in her hit “I Knew You Were Trouble,” your helicopter pilot will do the same, dropping you off at Hawthorne Airport three miles south of SoFi./nSorry, but you asked. Didn’t you?/nYou do get to bring six or seven people on the flight, and the price includes a $250 car-service voucher for the ride from Hawthorne Airport up Crenshaw Boulevard to SoFi./nAs for the one-way pricing of the shuttles, Ben Villalobos of IEX Helicopters said that mostly allows flexibility in flyers’ plans. Though if you do want to helicopter home from the show that’s fine too – it’s just an additional $2,499 for the return flight./n“Quite a lot of guests like to fly one way to the venue and then book an SUV through us for their return journey, as they may like to spend some time in L.A. after the show at one of the many great evening time venues,” he said in an email to answer a few questions about the shuttles./nIEX Helicopters has been flying passengers from the greater Los Angeles area to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio for a few years now, Villalobos said. About 200 people each year take that 45-minute helicopter ride to the desert for the festival, he said./nEarlier this year, IEX also added a shuttle service to Day Trip, the electronic dance music festival by the Queen Mary in Long Beach, Villalobos said./nBy Tuesday afternoon, IEX had nine inquiries from customers seeking helicopter shuttle rides, Villalobos said. As the six-night stand of Swift shows begins, he says that number should go up.",0,156,Unrelated,0

Find Out
/n/nKayla Nicole was once in the spotlight as Travis Kelce‘s girlfriend, but she’s now making headlines as his ex. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end is rumored to now be dating Taylor Swift, and she’s been spotted attending some of his games over the last few weeks. Before Taylor, Kayla was also a supportive girlfriend who would attend many of Travis’ games since the start of their romance, and she also publicly gushed over his success on Instagram./nKayla recently got attention when she unfollowed her former friend Brittany Mahomes, who is Travis’ teammate Patrick Mahomes‘ wife, as well as Patrick’s brother, Jackson Mahomes, on Instagram. The action came just days after Taylor and Brittany were spotted having dinner with friends and on the same day they were spotted sitting together during the Chiefs game on October 1. Kayla has not publicly given a reason for the unfollows, but many suspect Travis’ alleged romance with the “Midnight Rain” crooner could have something to do with it./nFind out more about Kayla and her romantic history with Travis below./nTravis and Kayla first got together in May 2017. Throughout their relationship, they walked high-profile red carpets together, including the ESPY Awards and Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Sports Awards. Kayla was also by Travis’ side when he celebrated his 2020 Super Bowl win at the Chiefs victory parade. However, by the beginning of August 2020, fans noticed the two had unfollowed each other on Instagram. Days later, Travis confirmed that he and Kayla had split. At the beginning of December 2020, Travis did a Q&A, and confirmed they had gotten back together when he referred to Kayla as his “girlfriend” during the chat. Days later, she posted a video of herself celebrating a Chiefs win on Instagram. Travis and Kayla ended their relationship for good in August 2022./nWhen Travis and Kayla broke up in August, there was speculation that the reason for the split was because he had cheated. However, he took to Twitter to deny allegations of infidelity, and there was no evidence that he had been unfaithful. “This is fake news…a lie,” Travis tweeted and subsequently deleted.. “And not why Kayla and I broke up. Take all your hatred somewhere else, please.”/n/nA post shared by Kayla Nicole (@iamkaylanicole)/n/nKayla works as an on-camera host, while also dabbling in some modeling. She has reported for outlets including BET, NBA, HotNewHipHop and more. Additionally, she’s worked as a reporter for the Los Angeles Lakers and has interviewed various celebrities, as seen in her video reel./nThe gorgeous gals were very close throughout the time Kayla was dating Travis. They regularly attended Chiefs games at Arrowhead Stadium together and posed for many photos together. Kayla also accompanied Brittany for her pre-wedding, including her bridal shower, before she tied the knot with Patrick in 2022. They went wedding dress shopping, and Kayla was one of the select few to come on her eight-person bachelorette weekend in February 2022./n/nA post shared by Kayla Nicole (@iamkaylanicole)/n/nKayla is also very into fitness and started her own fitness brand called Strong Is Sexy. She sometimes shares videos of her workouts to her YouTube and Instagram pages and says that the brand is meant to “refresh sexy from the inside out.” Kayla’s personal Instagram has more than 700,000 followers and her Strong Is Sexy page once had more than 50,000. She started Strong Is Sexy in 2020, but it’s unclear if she’s still actively involved with it./nAs of now, it appears that the sports journalist isn’t romantically linked with anyone. Since she is enjoying the single life, Kayla uses her platform to promote positivity./n

In part because I try to avoid reflexive sexism and patronizing the young whenever I can, but mostly because I was thinking less about the sport and more about the town./nWas Kansas City having its breakthrough moment at last? /nMy son has been telling me that KC was about to become the next San Francisco — OK, Austin — ever since he moved there a year ago. With a population hovering around 500,000 (2 million  in the wider metro area), Kansas City may be small, but as my son assures me on an almost daily basis, it is bristling with artists, writers, musicians, entrepreneurs, sports teams, political activism and, of course, the best BBQ east and west of the Missouri River./nAs images of the star cheering the Chiefs from a box at Arrowhead Stadium flew across social and then legacy media, I wondered if maybe, just maybe, he was right./nI mean, Taylor wouldn’t date a Chief if Kansas City wasn’t cool. So would the woman who just boosted local economies all across the country with her record-breaking concert tour soon be sprinkling her pixie dust on the Paris of the Plains? /nCould their nascent relationship last long enough for Taylor to be spotted strolling at the Plaza or picking up fresh produce at the River Market? Would she and Kelce be caught canoodling amid the biker merch at Blip Roasters in the West Bottoms, brewery-hopping in the Crossroads or debating sauces at Arthur Bryant’s?/nLook at what she did for ketchup and “seemingly ranch.”  Just days after a viral tweet showed her eating chicken tenders with said condiments (not quite avant-garde choices, admittedly), Heinz announced  a new “ketchup and seemingly ranch” product. /n“It’s a new Era for Heinz. Introducing Ketchup and Seemingly Ranch,” the company wrote on its Instagram. “Limited-edition bottles coming soon.”/nA mere rumor that Swift was making a post-game visit to Free State Brewing Co. in nearby Lawrence, Kan., sent fans flocking. (She was not there.) /n Music /nCultural dominance. History-making album sales. Sold-out stadiums. Add them up, and Taylor Swift’s current moment has little precedent in pop-music history./nAug. 1, 2023/nEven if Travis and Taylor don’t wind up together forever & always, maybe KC could at least get its own lyric, right? /nThe city certainly has endless poetic possibilities. Straddling the Missouri River and the state border, it is a city of bridges that is often at odds with itself — abortion is legal in Kansas, for instance, not so much in Missouri. Surrounded by farmland, sitting smack dab in the middle of the country, it faces the same struggles —with racism, housing instability, addiction and economic disparity — that every American city does and many of those — drought, dwindling agriculture and manufacturing jobs — more associated with rural America./nFar from being a flyover city, however, it also has a brand new $1.5 billion-dollar  terminal at the Kansas City International Airport, which brings the absurd scene in “Ted Lasso” in which Ted’s son apparently flies nonstop from London to KC a bit closer to reality — and makes it possible for visitors to eat BBQ literally the moment they get off the plane./nThis year, Kansas City hosted the NFL draft; next year it will open the first stadium built specifically for a pro women’s soccer team in the country. By 2025, 3.5 miles of track will be added to the Kansas City streetcar route, stretching it from the riverfront through popular city destinations to the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In 2026, KC will be one of 16 host cities for the World Cup./nOld stockyards and abandoned red-brick storehouses are gradually filling with hipster bars and coffee shops, galleries and artisanal-everything shops. The riverfront is lined with new apartment buildings and condominiums, and construction just began on the abandoned Rock Island Bridge, which will become an event space filled with restaurants and bars./n And now, perhaps, regular swarms of Swifties. /nTo be fair, Kansas City already has one shining star: Patrick Mahomes. Earlier this year, the Washington Post’s Annie Gowen crowned Mahomes “The King of KC,” noting that the Chiefs quarterback has already had a huge impact on the city, not just by leading the home team to three Super Bowls and two victories but also by investing in Kansas City, literally and figurative. /nHe has stakes in the Kansas City Royals as well as the city’s professional soccer teams, the Current (women’s) and Sporting Kansas City (men’s). He recently brought the San Antonio-based chain Whataburger north (after tweeting that he missed it). And he and his wife, former professional soccer player Brittany Mahomes, are building a home in the city’s southern suburbs./nNo wonder they lit up city hall in honor of the birth of each of their children, pink for Sterling, blue for Bronze./n Entertainment & Arts /nKansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce opens up about Taylor Swift watching him play Sunday. ‘It was definitely a game I’ll remember,’ he said./nSept. 27, 2023/nBut with apologies to Mahomes, he is not Taylor Swift. When the Empire State Building recently shone red and white, its official X account captioned the photo “ketchup and seemingly ranch.” /nIf Taylor Swift starts showing up regularly in Kansas City the airport may have to build another terminal. If she posts about liking a certain BBQ sauce, that sauce will sell out in a New York minute. /nMore importantly, many people who never gave the place a second thought, even after last year’s Super Bowl win, may find themselves thinking that everything is up to date in Kansas City. Including fans on either coast who may not be able to locate the city, or either state it’s in, unless there’s an election map in front of them. /nWhich in these divided times could only be a good thing. /nThat’s a lot of pressure to put on a relationship that may or may not advance beyond a few dates, though reportedly Swift plans to attend Sunday’s game between the Chiefs and the New York Jets in New Jersey. /nIt’s also fairly ridiculous. Except it’s not. If Swifties are going to be running around wearing Chiefs jerseys, buying football tickets and the nakedly opportunistic ketchup and seemingly ranch, if pundits are going to continually speculate on what it all might mean for NFL ratings and ESPN subscriptions ... well, maybe they could also pay a bit of attention to the city for which Kelce plays. /nMy son is a bit miffed that it took Taylor Swift for me to acknowledge that he might just be right about the city in which he has chosen to live. /nBut hey, it takes what it takes to break out in this noisy world. Maybe seeing Taylor Swift yelling her head off at a football game will do the trick./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

(Photo by Hugo Hu/LP5/Getty Images for TAS)/nIn early November, Taylor Swift will collect another No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with her about-to-be-released set 1989 (Taylor's Version). The re-recorded take on her first pure pop collection is all but guaranteed to reach the top spot, and when it does, it will mark the third time the set of songs breaks into the highest tier on the all-encompassing ranking of the most-consumed full-lengths in the U.S./n1989 was first introduced to the Billboard 200 back in late 2014. Swift topped the tally once again with the blockbuster release, which wasted no time going right to No. 1. 1989 opened atop the ranking with 1.287 million copies sold./nIn the years since 1989 debuted at No. 1, the set has continued to perform well on the Billboard 200. In fact, it has even returned to the top 10 recently, after interest in the title surged following Swift's announcement that it was to be the next to be re-recorded and re-released./nA year after Swift dominated the Billboard 200 with 1989, singer-songwriter Ryan Adams put his own spin on the set. The rocker recorded a complete covers album, not mixing up much from the original. Adams's version of 1989 debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 in the fall of 2015. Impressively, it launched just one spot ahead of Swift's edition, which was still going strong inside the top 10 at the time./nNow, Swift is about to return to the highest region on the Billboard 200 with 1989 (Taylor's Version). There's no telling exactly how big the title will be when it arrives, but so far, all three of the re-recordings that Swift has released have gone straight to the summit, and they keep getting bigger and bigger. 1989 (Taylor's Version) could possibly open with a million equivalent units, or perhaps just under that, making it not only the largest entrance sum for one of her re-records but one of the biggest in recent memory./n",2.212889533,163,Achievements,1

MAUI EFFORTS: Delivering Good, which provides people impacted by poverty, disaster and other tragedies with new merchandise donated by retailers and manufacturers, is preparing a response to support the victims of the wildfire that has devastated parts of Maui./n
	The nonprofit organization is ramping up its operations to ensure the group is ready to act as soon as the situation in Maui stabilizes. The team is working to identify the best partners to help get and distribute donated merchandise on the ground in Maui as soon as possible.  /n
	While the situation is still in flux with many areas either unreachable or with restricted access due to emergency rescue efforts, the charity’s experience has shown that essentials such as underwear, socks, T-shirts, children’s clothing, diapers and baby wipes are some of the items that are most needed during the early recovery period.

	Delivering Good is accepting donations of new merchandise and funds to support its relief efforts. Financial gifts are critically needed, the group says, and are tax deductible. Donations are 100 percent tax deductible and can be made at give.delivering-good.org.

STICKING TOGETHER: Coty Inc. may be, sources say, in talks with Kim Kardashian to sell back her beauty brand, but it is certainly holding onto its license with Adidas, which it has just renewed./n
	“Adidas is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the new well-being and athleisure trend in beauty amongst today’s consumers,” said Coty chief executive officer Sue Nabi about the renewal, of which terms were not disclosed./n
	It has partnered with the activewear giant since the ‘90s and introduced its first product in the U.S. in 1999 with the Adidas Moves for Him scent, followed by Adidas Moves for Her in 2000./n
	Nabi noted that in recent months, Coty has elevated Adidas’ body care offering with the launch of the Adidas Active Skin and Mind range./n
	“Consumers have responded very positively to the launch, and we look forward to building on this progress with an exciting pipeline of further innovations and lines as we drive growth in new and existing markets in the future,” she added./n
	After the launch of the Active Skin & Mind Range in Europe, Coty is looking to drive growth in China, forging a partnership with Su Yiming, the Chinese gold medallist in snowboarding, as an ambassador for the brand.

	








/n
	As for its other partnerships, at the end of last year, Coty sold its Lacoste fragrance license back to Lacoste by mutual agreement for an undisclosed sum and separately renewed its license with Hugo Boss. In May, it renewed its license with Davidoff, extending the companies’ long-running partnership, which began in the ‘80s./n
	There has also been much speculation about what will happen with its license for Gucci Beauty. Gucci owner Kering has been making a series of high level hires in its beauty division as it looks to become a serious player in the sector. The Gucci license is expected to expire in 2028. — Kathryn Hopkins/n
SPARKLE SWEEPSTAKES: Fashion brands seem to be getting slightly more bang for their buck from dressing Beyoncé for her “Renaissance World Tour” than Taylor Swift for her “Eras” concerts./n
	For example, Alexander McQueen won $7.7 million in media impact value, and Tiffany & Co. $7.2 million, for placing designs on Beyoncé, compared to Versace garnering $6.3 million after dressing Swift, data from Launchmetrics show./n
	The data firm’s tallies show that “Eras” has so far generated $97.5 million in media impact value, or MIV, and “Renaissance” $187 million. The proprietary MIV figure calculates the impact of relevant media placements on all channels (online, social and print), inclusive of paid, owned and earned mediums./n
	Roberto Cavalli accumulated $4.9 million in MIV, and Zuhair Murad $2.3 million, for dressing Swift./n
	By comparison, Balmain garnered $5.6 million and Valentino $3.7 million in MIV for dressing Beyoncé./n
	The two tours, playing to sold-out arenas and triggering viral moments on social media, represent “the perfect stage for brands to capture the gaze of millions, generating unparalleled exposure and reinforcing their image in the hearts of both dedicated fans and the broader public,” Launchmetrics said./n
	But a certain doll with a penchant for pink seems to have trumped the music superstars./n
	Zara’s decision to partner with Mattel on a capsule collection inspired by the looks of the hit “Barbie” movie won the fast-fashion retailer $11 million in MIV, according to Launchmetrics.

	








/n
	Brands that also won the attention sweepstakes with Barbie collaborations include Nyx, whose makeup collaboration garnered $8.5 million in MIV, and Boohoo, scoring $3.7 million for its co-branded collection of 38 styles./n
	Crocs also generated $3.7 million in MIV with its Barbie-themed collection of shoes and charms, while shoe chain Aldo scored $2.7 million with its range of footwear, bags and jewelry. /n
	The Barbie x Gap collection, spanning apparel, accessories, kidswear and even pets clothes, generated $1.8 million in MIV./n
	In a separate research study, Launchmetrics analyzed TikTok data, which shows beauty brands growing 53 percent faster than fashion in the first five months of 2023 versus the same January-to-May period last year./n
	Louis Vuitton, Chanel, L’Oréal and Fenty Beauty were among new entries in its top 10 ranking of fashion, luxury and lifestyle brands on TikTok. Sephora bumped Shein from the top spot and Fashion Nova, Balenciaga, Adidas and Walmart dropped off the list./n
	Launchmetrics noted that the “share of voice” garnered by TikTok influencers dropped 8 percent, with branded content logging the most growth at 4.5 percent./n
	Beauty brands grew at a monthly rate of 15 to 16 percent across prestige and mass market segments./n
	By contrast, luxury fashion and premium fashion brands outpaced mass market players, logging growth of 11 percent, 12 percent and 7 percent respectively. — Miles Socha/n
ART AND SEOUL: The Frieze Seoul frenzy will kick off Sept. 2 with “Lady Dior Celebration,” a new exhibit featuring 24 contemporary Korean artists at the house’s Seongsu-dong concept store./n
	The exhibit brings together a collective of eclectic artists to continue the interpretations of work inspired by the house’s famous Lady Dior handbag. /n
	Lee Bul’s famed “Cella” sculpture, originally created for the Miss Dior exhibit at Paris’ Grand Palais in 2013, will sit center stage. The 16-foot-tall crystal-shaped suspended cocoon invites the viewer inside the reflective piece./n
	Twenty-four Korean artists will create two interpretations each, for a total of 42 pieces on display.

	








/n
	Dior settled on Seoul for the exhibit due to its growing voice in the global cultural scene — not to mention its thriving luxury market — and the house’s historical ties to art./n
	“The ‘Lady Dior Celebration’ exhibition, which runs parallel to Frieze, is a unique and exceptional event, celebrating the powerful ties forged between Dior and South Korea, as well as the many unfailing affinities that unite our house and the art world,” Dior chief executive officer Delphine Arnault told WWD./n
	“At the heart of this unprecedented occasion, the Lady Dior, a timeless icon in perpetual reinvention, is reinterpreted by a selection of prestigious contemporary artists, pushing the limits of the imagination and savoir-faire of excellence more than ever; a fascinating, multifaceted tribute to the passion for creativity cultivated by Monsieur Dior, who was a collector and gallery owner long before he became a couturier,” she added./n
	“Odes to the beauty of dreams and emotions, these fascinating works — including those by emblematic Korean artists, are revealed in this exclusive retrospective,” the company added in revealing the artistic slate. “These leading creators, with their multiple imaginations, share the same goal: to translate and poetically sublimate the excellence and essence of the Lady Dior object of desire.”/n
	Among the creators contributing to the exhibit are sculptor Bahk Seon-Ghi, visual artist and production designer Choi Jeong-hwa, still-life painter Gigisue, multimedia humorist Gimhongsok and monochrome Dansaekhwa artist Ha Chong-hyun./n
	Photographer Heewon Kim, sketch artist Jia Lee, Jay Sae Jung Oh, whose works with sustainable materials blur the lines between sculpture and furniture, and Jukhee Kwon, who works with disused books, will also be featured./n
	Other artists in a range of disciplines include Jungjin Lee, Jungpyo Hong, Kwangho Lee, Kyungwoo Chun, Lee Hun Chung, Lee Kun-Yong, Minjung Kim, Oh You Kyeong, Ran Hwang, Soo Sunny Park, Suki Seokyeong Kang and Wonmin Park. Yesum Yoon and Zadie Xa will also be part of the retrospective./n
	The works will surround the central exhibit space in which Bul’s “Cella” serves as the anchor, with themed rooms jutting off like spokes to feature specific pieces and shapes, including a room dedicated to the Lady D-lite embroidered version and another to the rectangular Lady D-joy. Bags are perched atop mirrored pedestals, on display under glass, while others are tucked into coves.

	








/n
	The new exhibit is a spin on the “Lady Dior as Seen By” roving exhibit the brand launched in Shanghai and traveled the world to Hong Kong, Milan, Tokyo, São Paulo and Berlin over the decade to 2021, and the Dior Lady Art project, which pulled in artists from as far afield as China, Egypt and Qatar./n
	The second edition of Frieze Seoul is scheduled to take place Sept. 6 to 9 at the COEX convention center in the city. The “Lady Dior Celebration” exhibit will run until Sept. 17. — Rhonda Richford/n
NYFW THRIFT: Resellers are dialing up their presence at fashion week./n
	After holding intimate swap events for the past two years, ThredUp is assembling a “Thrifting Suite” and swap event on the eve of New York Fashion Week to “inspire more editors and influencers to wear thrift to NYFW,” according to the company. The invite-only thrifting suite in TriBeCa will be decked out with the reseller’s hand-curated items for fashion week. /n
	Meanwhile, Poshmark is also coaxing influential fashionistas into its ranks. The reseller will return to its peer-to-peer activations with a live selling suite at The Hotel Chelsea for a one-on-one consultation and guided resale experience in late August ahead of NYFW. The Posh team is offering up the service to media and special guests to offload the selling responsibility. Sellers bring in five to 10 items and meet with a closet consultant. From there, all sellers have to do is tune in to a live show, set the price of their goods and watch as viewers bid on their items./n
	The social aspect is a reigning differentiator at Poshmark. “As social media increasingly accelerates microtrends, consumers are purchasing, wearing and discarding their clothes more than ever,” said Chloe Baffert, head of merchandising and curation at Poshmark. “Shopping secondhand is an easy and sustainable way for consumers to keep up. From the cultural phenomenon of Barbie and highly sought after merch from Beyoncé and Taylor Swift’s summer tours, to Bella Hadid’s soccer-inspired blokette aesthetic dominating the athleisure category, social media trends quickly populate on Poshmark.”/n
	Given National Thrift Shop Day on Aug. 17, promotions ran all month across ThredUp and all week at GoodwillFinds (the e-commerce store for Goodwill), with special promotions and parties popping up from independent sellers on Poshmark. 

	








/n
	Though GoodwillFinds has no planned presence at fashion week, Matthew Kaness, chief executive officer of GoodwillFinds, said the company is still riding the thrifting high. “The key to fashion in any era is responding to consumer trends and cultural moments — and given the heightened interest in the circular economy, thrifting is an undeniable component in fashion’s future.”/n
	According to insights from First Research, the used merchandise industry in the U.S. encompasses more than 20,000 stores with combined annual revenue of roughly $15 billion. Publicly listed resale companies are catching their strides as they chase profitability. Reseller ThredUp posed a strong second quarter lifted by new company initiatives while The RealReal further fine-tuned its new strategy under CEO John Koryl. — Kaley Roshitsh/n

His vast knowledge base is evident in his body of work, which includes “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” “China: Through the Looking Glass,” “Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty,” “Camp: Notes on Fashion” and “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.” During his 20-year tenure, the celebrity-studded Met Gala has gained global traction from one year to the next. Simultaneously, Bolton’s star has also risen from the standpoint of FGI, which honored him with its Oracle award in 2016.  /n
	FGI will salute other standouts at the Oct. 17 Legends and Leaders gala at The Plaza Hotel. The group’s 39th annual event will hand over the Fashion Star award to Proenza Schouler’s Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez and the Humanitarian award to musician and Maestro Cares Foundation cofounder Marc Anthony./n
	With a track record of 40-plus years and still running, Dennis Basso will accept the Lifetime Achievement award. This year’s Beauty Innovation award will go to Gail Boye of Shiseido Americas. Fashion and culture thought leader Antoine Phillips will receive the Agent of Change award.

	FGI will present the American Icon award to Whoopi Goldberg, the moderator of ABC’s “The View” and an EGOT-winning actress-producer-writer./n

She was in support of the then-president until he refused to concede after he lost the 2020 election.

According to a recent political poll conducted by Emerson College, the idea of Swift running as a third-party candidate wasn’t too well-received. That poll deduced that those who took part preferred Trump, favoring him at 42% over Biden, who received a 39% share. 10% of those involved were undecided, while the singer only managed to claim 8%./nWhen asked simply how they viewed Swift, 43% of those who were a part of the poll said they saw her favorably, 38% said they were neutral, and 19% viewed her unfavorably./nHypothetical presidential matchups, like the one involving Swift mentioned by Emerson College in its poll, often serve as interesting discussion points, but the likelihood of Swift running for president remains highly unlikely./n",1.528998952,165,Social impact,1

Gov. signed a letter with state and local officials in Los Angeles, “urging singer Taylor Swift to cancel her highly hyped concerts” at SoFi Stadium “in favor of supporting solidarity with striking union hotel workers.”/nCalifornia’s Lt. Gov. “serves as Acting Governor whenever the Governor is absent from the state, and automatically becomes Governor if a vacancy occurs in the Office of Governor.” The Lt. Gov is also president of the state senate and serves on the University of California Board of Regents and other state education bodies. The duties of the Lt. Gov. do not include siding with one party in a labor dispute outside of state government. /nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 83.9 percent of California workers, the vast majority, are not union members. Only 16.1 percent of workers, a distinct minority, are union members, according to the BLS. Even if the numbers were reversed, that would be no justification for California’s Lt. Gov. to try and shut down Taylor Swift’s shows. That would force the singer to cancel contracts for the shows, void the tickets purchased in advance, and, as the Orange County Register put it, “punish music fans looking for entertainment.”/nAt the time of this writing, Swift has announced no plans to cancel the shows. The singer-songwriter didn’t become a “cultural and financial juggernaut” by caving to the misguided crusades of politicians. /nThis article was published by the Catalyst/nK.

/nAs her “The Eras Tour” concluded a six-night stint at SoFi Stadium, Taylor Swift shared some eagerly anticipated news with her fans (and, really, the entire entertainment community). Specifically, the artist confirmed a release date for the re-recording of her smash hit 2014 album “1989.”/nAccording to Swift, “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” will arrive on October 27. Swift calls the re-recording her favorite yet, “because the 5 From The Vault tracks are so insane. I can’t believe they were ever left behind.

Music's new icon did it her way./nTaylor Swift’s Eras tour started out as a retrospective of her nearly two decade career and a celebration of her 10 iconic albums. It has become an unprecedented financial phenomenon that has already brought in $780 million in ticket sales, on its way to becoming the highest-grossing tour of all time. And it’s ushered the 33-year-old pop queen into yet another new era: she is now a billionaire and the first musician to make the ranks solely based on her songs and performances. According to Forbes estimates, she is worth more than $1.1 billion, up $360 million from June when Swift ranked no. 34 among America’s richest self made women./nMuch of that boost comes from her unforgettable summer. She pocketed an estimated $190 million after taxes from the first leg of the Eras tour and another $35 million from the first two weeks of screenings of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour movie. Altogether more than $500 million of Swift’s fortune is cash earned from music royalties and touring. Another $500 million is based on the rising value of her music catalog, and she has $125 million in real estate including six homes and a $10 million private plane./nRepresentatives for Swift did not answer Forbes’ multiple requests for comment./nHer rise comes amid a boom for celebrity billionaires. She is the 15th celebrity in Forbes’ rankings to earn the billionaire moniker, and the ninth to do so in the last three years. She is also one of just four musicians to have officially achieved that status. But unlike her superstar colleagues, Swift doesn’t have a profitable side-hustle boosting her net worth. Jay-Z’s music didn’t solely propel him to billionaire status, it was his two booze brands, Armand de Brignac and D’usse, and his investments in companies like Uber. Similarly, Rihanna became a billionaire thanks to the success of her companies Fenty Beauty, a joint venture with luxury powerhouse LVMH, and her lingerie line Savage X Fenty. And while years on the road contributed significantly to the late Jimmy Buffett’s net worth, his Margaritaville Holdings empire, alcohol lines and investment in Berkshire Hathaway led Forbes to declare him a billionaire in April before his September death./nThat puts Swift in a class with legends like Bruce Springsteen. His lifetime pre-tax earnings are over $1 billion, the majority of which was earned on the road touring./nSwift and Springsteen have another thing in common: the value of their catalogs. In 2021, The Boss sold his masters and publishing rights for his songwriting and recorded music for nearly $500 million, sources told Forbes at the time. Swift’s catalog is now worth roughly the same, sources tell Forbes. /nHer master recordings—her first six albums—were famously scooped up in 2019 by Scooter Braun and later sold to Shamrock Capital for $300 million, which Swift claims was done behind her back. The pop singer famously took back control of her music shortly after that. Following a bitter public dispute, Swift got her revenge, signing a lucrative distribution deal with Universal Music Group that gave her complete ownership and full economic interest in both the songwriting and the recordings. She has since released four new albums and re-recorded versions of four albums that were part of the Shamrock sale, including 1989 (Taylor’s Version) that was released at midnight on Friday./nHer catalog “is a testament to the exceptional reach and impact an artist can achieve. Her music not only transcends borders but also defies the challenges faced by creatives in the streaming era,” Alex Heiche, the founder and CEO of Sound Royalties, tells Forbes./nSwift’s numbers don’t lie: since she released her 2019 album Lover—her first under her deal with UMG, ​​her U.S. album sales including track sale and streaming equivalents have totaled 37.3 million, according to data provided to Forbes by Luminate. “Given [her] sustained music industry dominance and her transformation into a global brand, it's evident that the catalog's value has substantially appreciated,” says Heiche, who notes that her original six-album master catalog was valued at $140 million by Braun's team just five years ago./nNotably, Swift wrote nearly all of her top 50 Billboard chart hits—she’s the sole writer on over one-fourth of them—boosting her share of the publishing pot significantly. Of course, she shares credits with frequent collaborators like Jack Antonoff and Max Martin, who would receive a portion of any hypothetical sale./nThe pop superstar couldn’t have done it without the Swifties, her uber faithful fans. “You’re like a main character in why this tour is so special,” she gushed at her movie’s premiere. “And I can’t thank you enough for that.” She gave them a shoutout in the trailer, too./n“This has been the most extraordinary experience of my entire life.”/n",0,178,Achievements,1

They make beds, clean bathrooms, and take care of every guest need. But right now, workers say they are struggling to make ends meet. Your shows make our region’s hotels a lot of money.”/nIt went on say that the hotels will make even more money when her concerts come to town, while hotel workers in the region are struggling and not benefiting from it./n“In Los Angeles, hotels are doubling and tripling what they charge because you are coming… but many workers cannot afford to live close to where they work. Some of them even sleep in their cars between shifts.

183,Josh Kurp,Taylor Swift’s Delicious Cookie Recipe Is Returning To The Spotlight Ahead Of ‘1989 (Taylor’s Version)’,Getty Image/Merle Cooper Be sure to make Taylor Swift's chai sugar cookies for your '1989 (Taylor's Version)' listening party.,https://uproxx.com/pop/taylor-swift-cookie-recipe/,hitfix,general,us,2023-10-06T15:53:58+00:00,FALSE,FALSE,183,"Windows swung right open, autumn air, cookie recipe is yours./nBack when she regularly posted on Tumblr, Taylor Swift shared the recipe for her now-infamous chai sugar cookies with cinnamon eggnog. “If you want to make the cookies from scratch (that’s what I did for the 1989 Secret Sessions), you can use this recipe I found on a baking blog I like,” she wrote before revealing her spin on the dessert. “I added the chai element to the recipe because I thought it would infuse cozy holiday vibez into the cookie and it really did.” It hits different, in modern (and Taylor-endorsed) parlance./nWith 1989 (Taylor’s Version) — no secret sessions this time — coming out this month and cozy, red scarf-wearing weather around the corner, now’s a good time to make Swift’s cookies, with a recipe assist from Joy the Baker. /nHere’s what you need from the original recipe:/n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup granulated sugar, plus extra sugar for topping
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 large egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt/nTo make it Sugar Cookies (Taylor’s Version), you also need to buy one packet of chai tea, another cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, and enough eggnog or milk for three tablespoons (or “TAYblespoons,” as she wrote with enough self-awareness to refer to herself as “so annoying, it astounds me sometimes”)./nAs per Taylor’s handwritten instructions:/n1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees/n2. Grease the cookie sheet/n3. Beat together the butter and vegetable oil, then add the granulated sugar, powdered sugar, egg, and vanilla/n4. Stir in the flour, baking soda, salt, and chai tea/n5. Put the cookie dough in the fridge to chill for approximately an hour/n6. Line the greased cookie sheet with 12 tablespoon “dough drops”/n7. Press evenly and cover with sugar/n8. Cook for “9-ish” minutes (love you, Taylor, but no recipe should have an “-ish”; exactly nine minutes will do)/nOnce the cookies have finished baking, mix together the powdered sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and eggnog in a bowl and spread the icing on top. Add an extra dash of cinnamon, and you’re all set. If it all goes well, they’ll look like they do here. It feels like a perfect night to make cookies at midnight, so enjoy!/n🎥| @taylorswift13’s chai cookie recipe has gone viral on Tiktok! 🍪🍂pic.twitter.com/l3zBLHU0kc/n— Taylor Swift News (@TSNewzUpdates) October 1, 2023/n",0,183,Social impact,1

[+] 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)/nTaylor Swift is bound to be one of the most-nominated artists at the 2024 Grammys. She may very well earn more nods than anyone else this time around, though nothing is certain until the list of potential winners is called out in a few months. The singer has a lot of music eligible, and she could compete in more than a dozen categories. If she ends up in one specific field, she will make history and earn another shot at finally winning the vertical./nThis time around, Swift is eligible in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance with perhaps a few tracks, but the most likely nominee of the bunch appears to be “Karma.” Swift re-released the Midnights song as a single in mid-2022, turning it from a solo endeavor into a joint affair. Rapper Ice Spice joined her on the reworking, and the pair sent it up the Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 2./nSwift will likely submit “Karma” for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance Grammy category, as it seems like the biggest hit that’s a fit for that field. If the two earn a nomination in that field, it will mark Spice’s first, as she’s never been up for an award before, though she may also be one of the top nominees this year. Unlike her duet partner, Swift has been here before. In fact, “Karma” will mark her third time competing, if she ends up in the running./nIf Swift returns to the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance vertical again, she will tie with three other women for the most nominations in the field. A third nod will put her on the same level as Ariana Grande, Christina Aguilera, and Lady Gaga. Assuming none of them snag another chance at gold this go-around, all three females will be tied with several other men for the third-most nods in the category. They all (minus Swift) currently come in behind only Coldplay, with five, and Maroon 5, with four./nSwift may have already been up for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance twice, but she has yet to win the award. She first appeared in the category with Kendrick Lamar on “Bad Blood” which lost to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’s “Uptown Funk.” A few years later, she was joined by Bon Iver on “Exile” which also competed, but that year the prize went to Gaga and Grande’s “Rain on Me.” In fact, of the three women Swift may soon tie, she’s the only one to never claim this grouping, though her total count of Grammys is now into the double digits, so she’s won plenty of gold already./nEligibility for the 2024 Grammys ends in about a month, in mid-September. Nominees are expected to be revealed in November, with the ceremony taking place in early 2024./n",6.713462857,184,Achievements,1

Swift now also claims the most No. 1 worldwide smashes among women./nBefore this week, Swift was tied for the third-most No. 1 songs among all acts on the Billboard Global 200 with two other musicians. Now, she’s broken that tie with both Drake and Olivia Rodrigo, who are both steady with their trio of champions./nCurrently, Swift and Bunny rank in second place among all acts when looking at who has collected the most No. 1s on the Billboard Global 200. The two superstars sit behind only BTS, but they’re not close to matching the South Korean powerhouses. BTS has charted seven leaders on the tally./nSwift first ruled the Billboard Global 200 in 2021 when her single “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version)” climbed to the summit. She returned to the throne in 2022 when “Anti-Hero” debuted in first place.

(Photo by Ethan Miller/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nMore than four years after it was initially released, Taylor Swift's song “Cruel Summer” has officially become the No. 1 track in America. This week, the tune bolts to the peak position on the Hot 100, Billboard's weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in America. As Swift conquers the chart once again, she claims a very special leader and makes history once again among women./n“Cruel Summer” is Swift's milestone tenth song to hit No. 1 on the Hot 100. Looking at solo female musicians only, she is just the sixth star to accomplish this feat./nAs “Cruel Summer” becomes her tenth No. 1, the tune helps Swift tie for the fifth-most leaders in Hot 100 history among solo females. She is now on the same level as Janet Jackson, who also managed 10 champions during her heyday./nWhen looking at all women, Mariah Carey rules, as she has thus far claimed 19 No. 1 hits on the Hot 100. Rihanna comes in second place with 14. Madonna is in third with 12. At the moment, both Jackson and Swift are only one No. 1 smash behind Whitney Houston, who collected 11 chart-toppers during her lifetime./nThis ranking changes considerably when groups and solo male artists are included as well. The Beatles continue to lead all acts, as they snagged 20 No. 1 hits on the Hot 100 in their run, which only lasted about a decade. Other names like Drake, Michael Jackson, and the Supremes are also ahead of Swift. Stevie Wonder also managed 10 No. 1s on the Hot 100, so he is currently also tied with Swift and Jackson./n“Cruel Summer” was first released in 2019 off of Swift's pure pop album, Lover. She planned to make it an official single, but several months into the promotional cycle, the COVID-19 pandemic shut everything down and Swift stopped pushing the album./nThe track gained popularity once more after she began performing it on her The Eras Tour in mid-2023. The tune quickly surged up streaming charts, and Swift and her team released it as a very unlikely single. It only took a few weeks before the track bolted into the top 10 on the Hot 100, where it languished for months behind other, bigger hits before finally taking the crown./nThis week, “Cruel Summer” shoots from No. 9 all the way to No. 1 on the Hot 100. It had previously topped out at No. 3, but in the past week, Drake filled much of the top 10 on the chart with songs from his new No. 1 album, For All The Dogs. Only two spaces inside the top 10 on the competitive tally were filled with non-Drake tunes, with Doja Cat and Swift managing to hold on./n",1.081059085,187,Achievements,1

Both the LAPD and the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department placed extra patrols on trains after a man was killed Wednesday night on the to the K (Crenshaw) Line, one station away from the Hawthorne/Lennox Station that ran one of two shuttle buses that dropped off fans at the stadium./nMetro rail lines A, B, D, E, C and K will operate late, until 2 a.m. to accommodate Swifties after the concerts, which run Aug. 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9. Since no train actually stops at SoFi, two free shuttles took passengers directly to the concert venue from a train station. One ran from the K (Crenshaw) Line’s Downtown Inglewood Station. The other ran from the C Line’s Hawthorne/Lennox Station. The shuttles will run 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. before each show, and for 90 minutes after the concerts./nBut the two shuttles were not full Thursday and the line to get on board the K Line at the Downtown Inglewood Station was nearly empty around 5 p.m., as extra accommodations went unneeded./nRows of security tape forming snaking lines before the shuttles became merely decorative as buses came and went with space inside to spare. A pop-up stand at one station selling TAP cards — in anticipation that there may be long lines at its three vending machines — struggled to get any traffic./nThose who did take public transit often rode early and were prepared in advance./nViridiana Gonzalez and Victoria Kravitz knew they wanted the peace of mind of riding Metro. The pair, who have been friends and Swift fans since high school, left from Arcadia on the A Line, wanting to avoid the frustrations that might come from riding with their parents./nKravitz said the more than two-hour public transit commute wasn’t a concern, and well worth it to escape the anxiety of traffic, parking, or other logistics./n“We get to get there early and enjoy the atmosphere and experience,” she said. “That’s better than stressing with my parents for two hours.”/nMany concert-goers were being dropped off in the ride-hailing lot at SoFi. Those who beat the crowds and got there early seemed to fare better./nCeline Castaneda took a Lyft from Long Beach to SoFi that took only 40 minutes and cost her $45. She arrived shortly before 11 a.m./n“I may carpool after the concert with some of the people I met,” she said./nGail Gallaher of Pasadena took the A Line train from the Memorial Park Station at around 2:30 p.m after waiting more than 20 minutes./nShe planned on meeting her husband at the stadium, after he parks their car at a school that rented out parking spaces. The couple had reserved a space there ahead of time./nWhile the train connections were a bit like alphabet soup, she is a veteran Metro user and felt confident she could find her way. “I am taking the A Line,” she said, pausing for several seconds, “to the God I don’t even know I think the Expo Line, then to the K Line, then to the shuttle that will get us to SoFi.”/nFor many Swifties, the concert is just part of the night out. And that’s what they say makes her concerts different. Some call it a spiritual experience./n“I think it will be fun,” Gallaher said before she boarded her first train. “Once I get closer to the concert I am going to see other people there and that will be fun.”/nMaria Gonzalez, 31, took a bus from Tijuana to Union Station on Thursday, the first leg on her journey to her first-ever Taylor Swift concert./nShe was on her phone hailing an Uber, leaning against the Metro information booth at the downtown train hub in the early afternoon./n“I am very excited. I don’t believe this moment is happening because it is here already,” she said. She bought the tickets as part of the original sale by Ticketmaster, not through a re-sale, she said. They cost about $150 each./nHer husband, Juan Morales, 34, whom his wife said was not a big Swift fan, said he was curious to learn first-hand what has become an American phenomenon./n“I want to try to understand the culture, all the fashion,” said Morales. “I want to see the outfits of the other girls and the people of all ages who are coming to this concert. I’m also looking forward to all the lights and sounds.”/nThe two carted a small suitcase on wheels out to the curb near Alameda Street. It contained Gonzalez’s outfit: a sparkly, green top that mimics what Swift sometimes wears, she said./nWhen asked if the cost of the tickets, the nearly 4-hour bus ride from Mexico and the Uber to the stadium is worth it, she responded without hesitation:/n“It is worth every cent,” she said. The two then quickly got into a silver Toyota Uber as the driver carefully stowed her rolling case in the trunk, then sped off./nIn my seat! Section 531!

, the online retailer wins. That’s according to the latest research from WPP BrandAsset Valuator (BAV)*, the “largest, most comprehensive brand analytics platform in the world”. The result is indicative of America’s love affair with Amazon. So the question is: can consumer fandom for the brand influence the current FTC lawsuit, which claims Amazon wields monopolistic power?/nLet’s first consider the BAV data:/n/n/nAmazon’s brand power grew strongly through the pandemic. Back in 2019, Amazon didn’t make the cut of BAV’s Most Loved retailers. By 2020 though, the brand had vaulted over the likes of Walmart, Home Depot and Target
TGT
 to claim the #1 position./nSo will Amazon’s popularity make FTC chairperson Lina Khan’s case more difficult? In her Yale Law Review Paper on “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox” back in 2017, Khan admits that “customers...universally seem to love the company.” But that was also true of Standard Oil in the first big U.S. antitrust suit back in the early 1900’s. As a history of Standard Oil stated: “Competitors disliked the company’s business practices, but consumers liked the lower prices.” That didn’t stop the U.S. Justice Department ordering the break up of Standard Oil in 1911./nThe outcome of the Amazon case won’t come down to a popularity contest. But in the words of Taylor Swift, the strength of the brand just might help Amazon “Shake It Off”./n*Jon Bird works for VMLY&R, which is part of WPP, the world’s largest marketing communications group./n",7.109107576,190,Unrelated,0

That’s impressive enough as it is, but her accomplishment is made even more astounding considering the fact that she’s managed the feat with two different singles, which have taken turns running the show. Now, as she swaps one cut for another, the singer matches a showing only managed by the biggest K-pop group in the world./n“Cruel Summer” is back at No. 1 on the Hot 100 this week. The smash returns to the summit for a third nonconsecutive frame atop the ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S. It takes over from “Is It Over Now?

Basically, she has now replaced herself atop the tally twice in a row, with one of her own singles interrupting the successful run of another./nThe first artist to manage this very specific feat was BTS. The South Korean pop band accomplished the rare showing in 2021. They first sat at No. 1 on the Hot 100 with “Butter,” which ruled for seven weeks. The septet then traded that winner for another, as “Permission to Dance” debuted atop the chart. Then, after just one frame in charge, that cut stepped down, allowing “Butter” to return to its former glory./n“Cruel Summer” became Swift’s milestone tenth No. 1 on the Hot 100 a month ago. It rose to the peak position more than four years after it was first released on her album Lover. Just as it was finally enjoying its time in the spotlight, she collected her eleventh leader on the chart with the quick win “Is It Over Now?,” which this week falls to No. 3./n",0.293290905,191,Achievements,1

On “The Greg Hill Show,” he said, “Well, I would say that Travis Kelce’s had a lot of big catches in his career. This would be the biggest.” /nWith Swift not scheduled to resume her Eras tour until Oct. 18 in Miami, the singer was reportedly seen in New York City this weekend and attended Sunday’s game between Kelce’s Chiefs  and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. An appearance would no doubt add fuel to the curiosity about the relationship, bringing joy to many but irking others, especially conservatives who have no love for Swift or Kelce. /nThe gravitational waves of Swift’s influence can be detected in sacred signs such as jersey sales (Kelce’s shot into the NFL’s Top 5 and his merchandise sales increased by 400% after last Sunday’s game), ticket sales — for the Chiefs, not Swift (StubHub reported a jump of nearly 300%), and the most holy of holies, Instagram followers (social media and branding agency bknown says the All-Pro tight end gained more than 860,000). Longtime NFL reporter Adam Schefter posted on the platform formerly known as Twitter that that figure represented gaining more followers “than he did following all three Super Bowls he played in combined.” The next-biggest NFL gainer last week? Travis’ brother Jason Kelce (137,000 added). Travis and Jason host the podcast “New Heights,” which also gained a considerable boost./n/n Music /nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s rumored relationship has taken pop culture by storm. A sports writer and a Swiftie reporter sound off on what it all means./nSept. 28, 2023/nIs this the real thing, though? That is, is this real love? A fling? Or just a clever bit of synergy cooked up by savvy marketers? /nWhatever it is, it is definitely not pleasing right-wing provocateurs. Conservative author and commentator Nick Adams, who boasts of being endorsed by Donald Trump, posted on X “Taylor Swift is a gold digger. Travis, GET A PRENUP!” (Conservative lawyer George Conway responded to that with “Taylor Swift’s estimated net worth: $740 million. Kansas City Chiefs active salary cap spending 2023: $202 million.”) /nAdams also, um, X’d: “Taylor Swift hates America … Taylor Swift loves communism. Maybe Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift would be good together.”/nIt does make sense, though, that those on the right aisle should find a pairing of these two the perfect storm of antiheroes. In 2018, Swift famously stuck her neck out in a very political way to object to Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn and later supported Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race (chronicled in the documentary “Miss Americana”). She has also said Trump “thinks this is an autocracy,” along with other opinions sure to rankle those who are rankled by such things./nKelce isn’t known for overt political statements, but he has done the next worst things in the eyes of some by making ads for Bud Light and promoting the COVID vaccine./nRight-wing commenter Tomi Lahren decried Swift’s “leftie, liberal, braindead political opinions” and wished the two luck “not with their relationship per se but rather myocarditis” (In 2022, the National Institutes of Health published a paper stating, while “proving causality is a particular challenge … [a study of] more than 151 million individuals [showed] the incidence of vaccine-related myocarditis was 0.95 per 100,000 individuals”)./nThat didn’t stop other commentators on the right, such as Charlie Kirk, from pondering, “What will break Kelce’s heart first? The COVID shot or Taylor Swift?”/nTo make matters much, much worse (to some), Swift recently encouraged her 272 million Instagram followers to vote. She linked to the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org, which reported a surge of more than 35,000 registrations following the post on National Voter Registration Day — 23% more than the same day the previous year. /nThe Federalist ran an article in early September titled, “Taylor Swift’s Popularity Is a Sign of Societal Decline.” Commentator Ron Filipkowski responded, “I urge all Republicans to continue to poke the angry hornets nest of the Swifties.” /n/nBut none of this seems to be fazing Swift herself, whose fandom keeps chugging right along. Her soon-to-release “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert movie crushed one-day advance sales records (when she couldn’t strike a distribution deal with major studios, she worked out Taylor’s version of one directly with AMC and Cinemark — and now the movie has seen its run already extended and expanded significantly, with Swift set to split as much as 57% of earnings with distributors). /nMeanwhile, the rerecorded “Taylor’s Version” of one of her most popular albums, 2014’s “1989,” is set to drop Oct. 27, and the Chiefs are currently atop their division. Whether there’s an actual romance here, or just a friendship, or a marketing ploy, Swift and Kelce seem to be doing just fine./nPerhaps their critics would be best advised to shake it off before they have to look what they make them (and their legions of fans) do next November./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

And you know what happens when one assumes./nHD radio signals are a tough sell, as the reach is limited compared with regular FM signals, due to a far lower number of HD radios in the hands of consumers as well as reception problems  — dropouts — when the signal isn’t pristine. That can often be made up by the use of smartphone apps and smart speakers … unfortunately adding more costs, such as music streaming license fees and costs associated with computers. As most HD signals have few to no commercials or sponsorships, it is most definitely a labor of love for owners who truly try to make a go of it./nCould the right format combined with the right promotion make an HD stream at least break even, if not profitable? That’s your question of the week: If you could program an HD stream, such as 105.1 HD3, what would you put on it and why? For extra credit, how might you promote the station to not only attract listeners but advertisers?/nIn the meantime, I’ll keep an ear to the ground to see if a new format will indeed be replacing All-Taylor./nNot Quite/n“In a significant change for Los Angeles radio listeners, KNX has stopped simulcasting its broadcasts on 1070 AM, a frequency it had occupied for over a century,” read the story posted at newsbreak.com. “The shift comes about a year and a half after KNX moved its main broadcast to 97.1 FM.” The story — no longer available online — went on to state that listeners were shocked when they tuned in to 1070 AM and didn’t hear the normal news format./nFirst, don’t panic./nA reader of this very column sent me the posting; at first, I just assumed that management made a decision that was, um, questionable. Most people I know still tune to KNX on the AM band due to its significantly stronger signal, even if the fidelity on most radios is not quite as good. “Stupid,” I responded./nBut then I tuned in to hear it for myself. Same news as always, an exact simulcast as has been happening for the past year. That’s odd…/nSoon KNX management responded directly to the story: “Hi there, Alex Silverman here, Director of News & Programming at KNX News,” said the social media post. “Just want to clarify: we have not ended the simulcast. KNX News is still on both 97.1 FM and 1070 AM in all hours except weekend mornings (Sat 6-11a and Sun 6-8a), when 1070 AM airs some paid and specialty programming./n“This has been the case for more than a year, and there has been no change recently. During those hours the news is available on 97.1 FM as well as the Audacy app and by asking your smart speaker to ‘play KNX News.’”/nSo what happened? AI, or artificial intelligence, that’s what I’m hearing. According to sources close to the subject, it was a story written primarily by artificial intelligence, and I will go out on a limb and state that the AI system involved probably just picked up a discussion by people related to the weekend morning paid programming. In the beginning of the simulcast, I am sure there were listeners surprised/shocked/etc. to hear something other than news in those time blocks. But weekend mornings do not translate to all the time./nLuckily for you, we don’t use AI here. In fact, I try to avoid all intelligence, not just artificial. Just ask my editor; he’ll agree completely./nFuture Series/nI am planning to start a feature on stations that don’t exist anymore. And not just the big ones. Stations like the original KDAY when it played top-40 and rock. Magic Oldies Radio K-WOW. KBLA. Stations you loved, but were not necessarily the stations that made it big./nI can use your help on this … if you have ideas for stations — and the personalities involved — to cover, send them my way./nRichard Wagoner is a San Pedro freelance columnist covering radio in Southern California.

203,,Taylor Swift's Eras Tour movie was big at the box office. Here are some takeaways,Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert movie posted huge box office numbers (though not as huge as some forecast). What are the takeaways?,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/newsletter/2023-10-17/wide-shot-taylor-swift-eras-tour-amc-box-office-newsletter-the-wide-shot,latimes,general,us,2023-10-17T14:00:40+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,203,"Welcome to the Wide Shot, a newsletter about the business of entertainment. Sign up here to get it in your inbox./nThe official numbers for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour movie are in, and they’re big. Just not quite as big as previously thought. The two-hour, 48-minute documentary’s box office tally came in at $92.8 million from the U.S. and Canada through Sunday, compared to the $95 million to $97 million estimated earlier. /nThat’s still enough to make “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” the highest-grossing concert film ever domestically, not adjusting for inflation, though not the biggest October opening weekend (that title still belongs to “Joker,” with its $96 million domestic debut four years ago). Swift topped the entire $73-million run of “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never”  to become the  concert doc record-holder.  /nSome analysts had expected a much bigger number from “Eras,” given the multigenerational appeal of the concert tour. One prognosticator put out an especially bold projection of $150 million. /nThe overwhelming T-Swift hype sweeping the country is  partly to blame for those inflated expectations. /nStrong early presales numbers got the industry too excited. Advance sales accounted for 60% of the opening-weekend revenue, according to EntTelligence, compared with about 40% for most other giant blockbusters. That and the fact that the audience skewed heavily female likely threw off distribution execs’ statistical modeling going into the weekend. Prerelease box office tracking is unreliable enough as it is. /nNotwithstanding the business’ money goggles, a weekend finish of $93 million — $123.5 million including international sales — is an impressive feat, considering hardly anyone knew the film existed until Swift announced it to her enormous following on Aug. 31. /nSwift eschewed the typical Hollywood system by dealing directly with the world’s largest theater chain, AMC Entertainment, to release the picture. AMC allowed other exhibitors to show the film as well by working with “RRR” distributor Variance Films. Theater operators, amid a shortage of movies from studios, have advocated for alternative programming “events” that draw infrequent moviegoers. Swift’s film is that on a giant scale. /nThe unusual arrangement certainly benefited Swift. About 57% of the box office goes to Swift and AMC’s distribution fee (mostly Swift), with the remaining 43% landing in theaters’ coffers, whereas ticket sales typically are split roughly 50-50 between the studios and the exhibitors. Not a bad take for Swift, on top of what she made from the Eras Tour itself, which is projected to clear more than $1 billion in grosses. /nAMC scored from its deal as well, with its theaters accounting for 40.5% of the domestic total (its market share is normally 22% to 25%). Only a few of the top 100 theaters for the title were not in AMC’s circuit. /nThe Swift pact was yet another eye-catching move for “meme stock” AMC and its quirky chief executive, Adam Aron, who previously made waves by promoting NFTs and investing in a literal goldmine, and this year courted controversy among investors for its stock-conversion plan. (Last week, he used X, formerly Twitter, to disclose that he was targeted by an extortion plot.)/nWhether there are any lessons to learn from the weekend is hard to say. Having an actual studio involved would’ve meant a more traditional marketing push for “The Eras Tour,” whereas Swift’s was more social media-based. Would a broader promotional campaign have increased business, particularly among those not in the target demographic? /nWith the Eras Tour movie, Swift created one of the few products on Earth that requires hardly any marketing. At this point, consumers know whether or not they’re interested in seeing three hours of the “Cruel Summer” singer on the big screen. It seems unlikely that a phalanx of TV spots would’ve convinced many males over 35 that this was going to be the second coming of “The Last Waltz.” /nIt’s hard to even compare “The Eras Tour” to other concert films, a genre that’s having a bit of a moment right now. A24’s legacy release of Talking Heads’ “Stop Making Sense,” directed by Jonathan Demme, hit its target market of film devotees, music nerds and Gen X nostalgics. Beyoncé Knowles-Carter is bringing her Renaissance tour to theaters via an agreement with AMC that’s similar to Swift’s. /nBut Swift has unique appeal. The NFL is using her star wattage to bring more attention to football, as if the sport needed the boost. Her and Travis Kelce’s cameos on “SNL” generated further buzz for the show and the couple./nThanks to Instagram and TikTok, the Taylor-fication of theaters was hard to miss. /nAn influx of Swifties created a party-like atmosphere, with fans coming decked out with costumes and friendship bracelets and dancing in the auditoriums, which, as long as people came to the multiplex for that experience, doesn’t seem to be a real cause for concern among people who care about in-theater decorum. Let’s not let anyone’s view of the cinema as a temple get in the way of someone else’s good time. /n“Customers were dressed up in their shimmer and so many fun outfits,” said B&B Theatres executive Brock Bagby in an email. “We had customers singing and dancing in the aisles. It was a really neat moment in time for us and our industry.”/nTake a picture of the screen during Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon,” on the other hand, and you’ll get another type of reaction. /nDisney at 100: Seven ways Walt’s company forever changed entertainment.

Nothing is certain when it comes to the biggest award show in the music world, but these days, it’s not smart to count against the singer-songwriter./nOf course, deciding who may win what some still consider the top prize at the Grammys—while others argue that Record of the Year, which focuses on one specific track, is actually the top honor—is thinking a bit too far ahead.

Both Swift’s Midnights and SZA’s SOS are locks for the category, and they may be the frontrunners to win as well./nPast nominees like Olivia Rodrigo, Foo Fighters and Lana Del Rey may return for another shot at glory, and they may be the second tier of nearly-confirmed nominees./nMorgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time is the biggest album of the year in America in terms of consumption, and it’s hard for Grammy voters to ignore blockbusters of this size...even if some still have reservations about nominating controversial figures. However, that doesn’t mean Wallen has it in the bag. The Weeknd’s After Hours was a shoo-in a few years back, but eventually passed over, so anything can happen./nThe Barbie soundtrack may seem like an odd choice for an Album of the Year nomination, but it was a huge success, and it spun off a number of hits—including ones by Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish that are in the running for some major Grammy love as well.

NFLX
, performs spectacularly well. With some level of success guaranteed, Swift is now trying new things and reaching further than ever before, and it's working brilliantly./nThe superstar currently rules the box office with her concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The movie shattered records in its debut weekend, bringing in just under $93 million in North America and $123 million globally. After just a few days, her latest concert capture is perhaps the top-grossing such film of all time, but it didn't mark the first time she had released such a project./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is just the latest in a long line of documentaries and concert films that the singer has released throughout the years. In fact, Swift has now dropped several projects that let fans in on the behind-the-scenes of her working life. She's previously doled out titles like The 1989 World Tour Live, Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour, Taylor Swift: City of Lover and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions. They all differ from one another in scope and scale, as well as what they cover, but performance is usually key./nAll of those titles quickly became available via some of the most popular streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu and Disney+. Swift is one of many superstars who has been able to pull in multi-million dollar paydays with their films, which became must-sees for not only Swifties but anyone interested in pop culture./nIt would have been incredibly easy for Swift to go the same route with Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. If she'd offered it to the top players in the business, they likely would have eagerly offered tens of millions, perhaps making it the costliest concert film of all time, at least in this realm. Swift decided to try something else this time around, and while it was a bit of a gamble, it worked out incredibly well for the Grammy winner./nInstead of taking the easy—and lucrative—route, Swift opted to release Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in theaters. There was no promise that her fan base would show up, or even if they did, that it would make at least as much money as she'd earn from a straight sale to a streamer. But clearly, she made the wise business move, as Swift is earning much more from this coup than her tried-and-true plan./nSwift and her team reportedly earn a little under 60% of box office grosses from Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. With the movie having already made more than $120 million, that's around $65 to $70 million going to the singer and her group. What specifically she'll take home isn't clear, but it's certainly more than the $10 million to $20 million that she might have collected from a streamer in a one-off payment./nIt's worth noting also that Swift might still sell the title to someone like Apple
AAPL
 or Netflix later on, once it's done in theaters. While she might not earn as much in the future because the movie has already been seen by millions, at that point, it's all just extra cash to add to her massive success./n",2.367302348,209,Filmography,1

Pollstar data from late June showed the average ticket price for the tour was just over $250 on the primary market and average attendance was nearly 54,000 over 38 performances through the end of June, making the tour the biggest of the year so far—beating out Harry Styles, Elton John and Bruce Springsteen. Swift is set to perform a whopping total of 117 worldwide performances on the tour through August 2023./nForbes estimates Swift to be worth $740 million, as of June 1. However, in late June, Forbes estimated the tour had grossed nearly $110 million, after paying its concert promoter and production costs, which could bring Swift’s net worth up to $780 million./n",29.14156869,212,Tour,1

As for their costume ideas so far? It’s not the most original idea since we can guess a ton of couples plan on going as this for the holiday. But an insider told the outlet that Travis and Taylor want to celebrate Halloween by dressing as… Barbie and Ken following the massive success of the film this year./nAgain, it is not the most creative idea, but we bet they would still slay with their looks! It is no secret that Travis loves to get decked right before his football games, so he and the 33-year-old pop star most likely would go all out with the costume./nRelated: Catching Kelce Alum Defends Travis Kelce — Says Ex Cheated On HIM!/nWhere do they plan on wearing a Ken and Barbie costume though? Well, Heidi Klum may have the perfect party for the couple where they can rock those ‘fits!

In fact, she said they could show up at the event without an official invitation if Taylor and Travis wanted to:/n“If they would just show up, I’m sure no one at the door will turn them away. Unless the costume is so strong that no one recognizes them, like mine.”/nLolz! We cannot wait to see what Heidi has up her sleeves this year for her costume!/nBut when it comes to Taylor and Travis, the America’s Got Talent judge’s event would be the perfect place for the two to get in some quality time together before the songstress’ tour picks up again in Argentina in November. The Dailymail.com source even pointed out that the Kansas City Chiefs tight end wants to “get in as much time” together “as possible” before she leaves the states:/n‘The whirlwind that this relationship has started is something that Taylor is familiar with, and Travis is OK with. He wants to get in as much time as possible with her before she embarks on her international tour.”/nHowever, the insider added that Taylor and Travis haven’t “100 percent” decided on if they’ll attend Heidi’s party this year – although it is “a very big option” on the table right now:/n“Since they have made things official in other ways that they have even started a relationship, they are really feeling it all out and they might want to make that night be the night they go, red carpet official. This is the relationship they put themselves into, and they are prepared to see it through and see where it goes and are looking to take advantage of everything it brings on the outside along with the personal enjoyment that comes from it.”/nKeep your fingers crossed, Swifties, that Taylor and Travis make an appearance at Heidi’s party!

He’s a handsome N.F.L. player with a popular podcast and the initials T.K. Together, they have fused America’s obsession with pop stars and athletes into a celebrity pairing so incandescent it’s almost celestial./nThat’s the story of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, the reigning prince and princess of American pop culture. But it’s also the plot of a recent work of erotic fan fiction, which some readers — many of whom are fans of Ms. Swift — are decrying as an invasion of privacy./nIn a since-deleted TikTok video, which is still available on her Facebook page, an independent romance author who publishes under the name Ivy Smoak announced the release of a short e-book. In the video, Ms. Smoak claims to have written the novel in three days after receiving requests from readers for a “spicy” romance inspired by Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce’s relationship. According to the trailer, the book would involve a “pop star princess,” a “football superstar,” a “sassy heroine” and a “secret relationship.”/nOn Sept. 29, less than a week after Ms. Swift’s first appearance at a Kansas City Chiefs game, Ms. Smoak published “Roughing the Princess” to Kindle’s Direct Publishing platform, which made it available for purchase on any Kindle device and as a free download for Kindle Unlimited subscribers./nThe cover of the e-book features a cartoon image of a blonde pop star shown from behind. She is holding a microphone and wearing a red football jersey emblazoned with the number 69. While the book claims to be “inspired by” the real-life romance of Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce, and starts out with a disclaimer stating that “any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is purely coincidental,” many readers felt that the attempt at “shipping” — the act of imagining or championing a relationship between celebrities — hewed too close to reality, and they flocked to Twitter, TikTok and GoodReads to denounce it as inappropriate X-rated fan fiction./nIn a review on Goodreads, a user with the screen name Isabella called the book, “almost creepy” in a 1-star review. “if i could give this 0 stars, i would,” she said. “i love shipping TS/TK but this makes it weird.”/nTo followers of BookTok — the nickname for TikTok’s avid reader community — there is a clear distinction between books that are loosely based on real people, and those that are “real person fiction,” a subgenre of fan fiction in which amateur authors create unauthorized fictional stories involving real people./nMany on BookTok felt that “Roughing the Princess,” which borrows exact details of Mr. Kelce and Ms. Swift’s biography and romance, while using nearly direct quotes from Mr. Kelce’s interviews and podcasts, read more like “real person fiction” than an “inspired by” story. That fact, coupled with the book’s graphic sex scenes, left many readers feeling uncomfortably voyeuristic, as if by simply reading the book they’d participated in violating their favorite pop star’s privacy. Devoted fans of Ms. Swift felt duped and disgusted./n“It’s fine to write a fanfic and it’s fine to write smut, but when you combine the two and then try to pass it off as an ‘inspired story’ when it’s very obviously about two real people, that’s not OK. That’s not right. That’s gross,” said Gina Burgess, 33, a TikTok creator who lives in Florida. Ms. Burgess made a video declaring “Roughing the Princess” to be “the worst book I’ve ever read in my entire life.”/n“I read a lot of other books that have smut in them and I’ve never felt gross after them, but this one I did,” Ms. Burgess said./nOther “Roughing the Princess” readers echoed this sentiment in videos posted to TikTok and Twitter./n“This is not what the girlies wanted when we said we wanted a ‘football star meets pop star’ inspired romance book,” Kayla Compton, a social media manager for authors who has more than 54,000 followers on TikTok, said in a review. “It just felt like a gimmick to make some money.”/nMs. Compton, 26, said that as a football fan, a Swiftie and an avid reader, she felt compelled to finish the book, even though she wanted to stop reading after the first few pages. “I felt like I had to review it,” Ms. Compton said. “And I don’t ever do negative reviews, so the fact that I did it speaks to how much she shouldn’t have written it.”/nMs. Compton pointed to the book “The Playlist” by Morgan Elizabeth as a good example of a “spicy romance” that was inspired by Ms. Swift, but isn’t explicitly about her personal life./nShortly after Ms. Smoak published “Roughing the Princess” online, it was yanked from Amazon, and almost all mentions of it were scrubbed from Ms. Smoak’s social platforms. It’s unclear whether Amazon unpublished the book, or if Ms. Smoak took it down herself; it’s also unclear if it was taken down as a response to reader feedback, or if there were potential legal or copyright reasons for the decision. (Ms. Smoak and representatives for Ms. Swift did not respond to requests for comment.)/nInstead of wiping the book’s existence from her social media and continuing to post about unrelated subjects, some BookTok users expressed that they would have preferred for Ms. Smoak to have taken accountability for the release of “Roughing the Princess” and apologize./n“I think she could have come out and said, ‘Hey guys, I messed up,’” said Ms. Burgess. “I’m going to take time to examine what I should be writing and not take real events and make them into smut.”/nThis isn’t the first time Ms. Swift’s love life has been the topic of fan fiction. Her close friendship with the model Karlie Kloss has long been a source of “celesbian” fan fiction for so-called #Kaylor devotees who believe the two secretly fostered a romantic relationship. But many fans felt that Ms. Smoak’s book crossed a line by including graphic conversations and sex scenes involving two characters so clearly modeled in the image of Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce, especially when Ms. Swift has been consistently vocal about how much she dislikes speculation about her love life./n“If you’re writing a Kaylor book, that’s not real life, you’re imagining things,” said Ms. Compton. She also pointed out that fan fiction is typically free, whereas copies of “Roughing the Princess” were on sale for $6.99. “Fan fiction either is written about fictional characters or, if it’s about real people, it still has a large element of fiction and it’s free,” Ms. Compton said. “When you write a spicy fanfic story and you’re paywalling it, that’s when it gets weird.”/nAdvertisement",-11.72787188,216,Unrelated,-1

	Rumours swirling online that Taylor Swift has scheduled a week of performances in downtown Vancouver at the tail end of her massively popular Eras Tour appear to be false./n
	Excitement grew among ""Swifties"" earlier this week after a TikTok user claimed the superstar was planning a series of shows at BC Place in January 2025, citing a second-hand source with connections to the stadium./n
	""She's going to be here for a whole week,"" said Coralie Lynch in the video. ""And the person who leaked that information from BC Place got fired. You're welcome.""/n
	Virgin Radio host Amy Spencer, who considers herself a diehard Swift fan, told CTV News she enjoyed the hype this week, despite being skeptical./n
	“I’m feeding into the delusion. I love the delusion. I want to believe that yes, she is coming here in 2025,” Spencer said. “Please Taylor Swift, we need this.”/n
	Unfortunately for fans, officials at BC Place have denied the rumours, calling them unequivocally ""false.""/n
	""We have no dates nor are we in discussion for any future concert dates (including 2025),"" a spokesperson told CTV News in an email. ""While we'd love to have Taylor back to BC Place, we do not foresee this changing in the near future.""/n
	The disappointing news marked the second time local Swifties have had their hopes dashed this month./n
	In early August, the artist confirmed – after much urging from fans and a few politicians – that she was bringing her Eras Tour to Canada, but only announced six shows at Rogers Centre in Toronto./n
	Spencer said those tour dates put to rest another set of rumours – that Swift was avoiding Vancouver because local venues don’t have enough capacity./n
	“(Rogers Centre) has smaller capacity than BC Place. So, capacity wise, we’re good to host her. We just need the go ahead,” she said./n
	Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among a number of elected officials who tweeted at Swift, referencing the lyrics from some of her hit songs while asking her to consider tour stops in the country./n
	""It's me, hi. I know places in Canada would love to have you. So, don't make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon,"" Trudeau wrote./n
	The Eras Tour, which is billed as an homage to all of Swift's studio albums, includes 146 planned performances everywhere from Switzerland to Japan, and is currently scheduled to run until Nov. 23, 2024, which is the date of the last show in Toronto. /nThe Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

No use on ... [+] publication covers is permitted after August 9, 2023. Taylor Swift performs onstage for the opening night of ""Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour"" at State Farm Stadium on March 17, 2023 in Glendale, Arizona. The city of Glendale, Arizona was ceremonially renamed to Swift City for March 17-18 in honor of The Eras Tour. (Photo by John Medina/Getty Images)/nFor those who haven’t noticed, Taylor Swift is currently promoting two singles simultaneously. One of them, ""Karma,"" is from her latest album of original material, Midnights, while the other, ""Cruel Summer,"" was first made available years ago on her set Lover. It’s rare to see any artist pushing a pair of cuts at the same time, but Swift’s move isn’t just uncommon, it may set a precedent that changes how the music industry works./nSwift’s unique approach of promoting two hits at once challenges the conventional thinking in the music industry. For decades, the norm dictated that artists should release one single at a time and focus all their promotion efforts on its success./nHer current strategy of promoting two tracks at one time goes against the idea that the public needs to focus on a single track for it to succeed. The belief has been for years that promoting multiple tracks to the same people simultaneously could lead to diluted messaging and reduce the chances of a song's success, as fans and the powers that be split their focus, hurting both tunes in the process./nHer success with both ""Karma"" and ""Cruel Summer"" suggests that this traditional approach may no longer be the only viable option./nThe two songs shared space with one another inside the top 10 on the Hot 100 for several weeks recently. They also almost replaced one another atop Billboard's Pop Airplay chart, hitting No. 1 on the competitive tally just weeks apart. Scoring a pair of simultaneous top 10s on the Hot 100 is one thing, but securing two radio wins so close to one another really is rare to see./nIt must be noted that ""Karma"" and ""Cruel Summer"" are not just two singles; they come from different albums, eras and have distinct sounds. This diversity in her promo plan music accomplishes different goals, and it could be one of the reasons why her move worked. Swift's immense star power surely also played a role in her ability to pull off such a feat successfully./nArtists have charted simultaneous hits in the past, but few, if any, have done so in this manner. Some have released more than one track to different segments of the radio audience, or perhaps for one to follow up another and replace it, keeping a winning streak going. Others have charted wins as a featured act on someone else’s tune and then as a star of their own production. Swift did none of these things. “Karma” and “Cruel Summer” were in competition with one another on the same charts, and they both managed to succeed./nConsidering Swift's accomplishments, the music industry may witness a change in the way singles are promoted. More major artists could adopt the approach of releasing several singles simultaneously, all aimed at the same crowd at the same time. Instead of promoting different cuts in various periods or to different groups of fans (or potential fans), artists and their teams may choose to release a significant amount of music at once, considering all of it as proper singles./nThis shift may be due in part to the changes in how people consume music. They no longer need radio programmers to create a hit, as radio can now sometimes follow what’s happening on TikTok and on streaming platforms like Spotify. Perhaps when a star is hot, they can count any number of smashes at one time. Or, maybe, this is the kind of thing that only Swift can get away with./n",13.71124693,218,Discography,1

[+] Swift | The Eras Tour at Lumen Field on July 22, 2023 in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Mat Hayward/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nIn recent weeks, Taylor Swift has been ascending on the Hot 100 chart with her current single, ""Cruel Summer."" The electro-pop track has been steadily gaining ground, although its progress has recently slowed. Despite its steady rise, it has not yet secured the coveted top spot on the chart, instead remaining inside the top five./nWith new contenders vying for the highest position, Swift finds herself at a crossroads, and if she wants to give “Cruel Summer” a chance at claiming the throne, she needs to do something really special with the tune./nPresently positioned at No. 4 on the Hot 100, ""Cruel Summer"" might experience a slight bump up in its ranking when Billboard updates the list today or tomorrow...but the odds of it reaching the very top seem slim for now. So, what can Swift do to rejuvenate interest and bolster consumption of this hit? There are a number of options on the table, including strategies she has employed successfully in the past./nOne potential idea is for Swift to release a new version of ""Cruel Summer"" as a duet with a range of musical stars, all of whom would undoubtedly be thrilled to collaborate with the superstar. This approach has been tried before, and while it has elevated the track's standing, it hasn't consistently resulted in a No. 1 position./nThe most recent example of this move is Swift's re-release of her single ""Karma"" from the album Midnights, for which she teamed up with rapper Ice Spice. That reworking, along with a music video, propelled the song to No. 2 on the Hot 100. A few years back, Swift and Shawn Mendes united their talents on a duet version of ""Lover,"" which successfully broke into the top 10./nIn the past, during her promotion of the album 1989, Swift altered the song ""Bad Blood"" by collaborating with rapper Kendrick Lamar. This collaborative effort drove the high-energy track to the No. 1 position on the Hot 100, resulting in a shared victory. Interestingly, Swift later secured the Album of the Year Grammy, in part due to the success of “Bad Blood,"" beating Lamar in the process./nAlternatively, Swift could choose to keep ""Cruel Summer"" as a solo endeavor while offering fans additional incentives to listen or repurchase the song. Fresh remixes, acoustic versions, live performances or other alternate recordings of the composition could all reignite interest in the single. Given that Swift has been performing the track throughout her ongoing tour, a live recording might already exist, ready to be unveiled./nShould Swift decide to re-release ""Cruel Summer"" as a duet or release new renditions of the song, her millions of fans would likely flock to streaming platforms to hear whatever she offers. Depending on the nature of these releases, fans might also consider purchasing the new versions on platforms like iTunes and Amazon
AMZN
./nAll collective consumption of the different iterations of ""Cruel Summer"" would contribute to its overall chart performance, as Billboard combines all versions into a single entity. If the original version of the song has begun to lose traction in terms of streams and purchases, combining its numbers with those of new editions and collaborations might be sufficient for Swift to surpass competitors like Oliver Anthony and Luke Combs./nOriginally featured on Swift's pop album Lover, ""Cruel Summer"" made its debut four years ago. It was not promoted as a single at the time, as Swift's plans were disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to a shortened promotional period. The pandemic also prevented her from touring the project, and as a result, she has integrated several tracks from the album into her ongoing The Eras Tour./nAfter months of heightened interest in the infectious tune, Swift and her label responded to fans' demands and officially released ""Cruel Summer"" as a single. The song swiftly climbed into the top 10 of the Hot 100, becoming another major win for the star./nThe question of whether Swift will endeavor to influence the charts and attain another No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 with ""Cruel Summer"" is yet to be answered by the singer herself. However, if she's inclined to do so, the time is now. As the popularity of ""Cruel Summer"" appears to be waning, any moves to reclaim its prominence need to take place while it’s still at its high. If she makes major moves in the coming weeks, it might be too little, too late./n",1.355712157,219,Achievements,0

Swift fans who go to theaters for ""Eras"" will lay eyes on posters for other films and view trailers from their seats just before they start singing in unison to Swift's greatest hits./n""There is a halo effect on upcoming movies, so it's also good for studios that have films coming out in weeks and months ahead,"" Dergarabedian said. /nIt could also more generally spur interest in the movie-going experience. /n""It is showing that theaters have more to bring to movie audiences than just movies in a theater,"" said Stan Ruszkowski, president of the Boxoffice company, a provider of film industry data. ""It's a place where you share an experience and watching a concert in a theater is much more fun than watching it on a couch at home on your own.""/nAlicia Reese, a vice president and entertainment analyst for Wedbush Securities, estimated that the ""Eras"" film could gross anywhere from $100 million to $400 million in its opening weekend. /n""There are no comparisons. It's unprecedented, so it's really hard to estimate,"" she told CBS MoneyWatch. ""The reason for that is one, because she has such a massive built-in fan base, and two, because it's hard to estimate the number of repeat visitors who bought presale tickets for opening weekend who are going to go back the next three to four weekends.""/nThe ""Eras"" film, part of the ""event cinema"" genre, is expected to draw crowds who don't usually  turn up at movie theaters. /n""There's going to be a whole new group of people who come to the theater who haven't been in an awfully long time and will enjoy communal experience in a way they haven't before,"" said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events, a distributer of event cinema content. ""A lot of times you are told to be quiet and turn your phone off. This time you'll have people dancing in the aisles singing along. It will be a great thing for event cinema.""  /nMusic and movie industry executives will be keeping a close eye on the film's performance, and depending on its success, will seek to replicate the format many times over./nA recent writer's strike, and ongoing actor's strike have halted production and could lead to a gap in new television and movie releases next summer. /n""Studios and theaters will look to alternative content to do that,"" Reese said. /nThat could include concert movies or recorded comedy shows, which typically debut on streaming platforms like HBO and Netflix. /n""But why not movie theaters? They are definitely a possibility,"" Reese said./nMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

And simply going to one of those evenings wasn’t going to be enough for two mother-daughter duos from Orange County./nThere are Swift fans, and then there are the full-blown, diehard loyal Swifties.

Because some of the diehards are my friends./n/nFrom left, Tiffany Totten, Lori Totten, Emma Ramos and Andrea Ramos pose for a photograph before attending Taylor Swift’s first of six sold-out concerts at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood on Thursday, Aug 3, 2023.

/n/nI’ve witnessed my longtime friend Lori Totten, of Brea, and her soon-to-be 19-year-old daughter Tiffany go to extraordinary lengths to join the millions of fans that scored tickets to see Swift out on her The Eras Tour. I was with Lori on a trip to Boston in 2019, sitting at an Italian restaurant and waiting for our dinner, when she manically tried to purchase tickets on her phone to Swift’s Lover Fest, the ill-fated 2020 outing in support of Swift’s seventh studio album, “Lover.” That would have played off as the first big concert at the all-new SoFi Stadium that year had it not been for the COVID-19 pandemic./nI just also happened to be with her and two of our girlfriends on a trip to Big Bear when Swift dropped her latest album, “Midnights,” last year. We stayed up to listen to the album through and through in our cozy cabin as the clock struck midnight./nWhen The Eras Tour went on sale last year and the overwhelming amount of fans crashed the Ticketmaster website, Lori and her longtime friend Andrea Ramos of Yorba Linda were both frantically attempting to score tickets to any and every show. By some divine stroke of luck — and hours and hours with no bathroom breaks — Ramos was able to pick up tickets for the Totten ladies, herself, and her 18-year-old daughter Emma, to Swift’s concert on May 5 in Nashville, Tennessee. After more stress and haggling, the two now-very-savvy ticket-buying women were finally able to secure tickets to a show closer to home and bought passes to see Swift at SoFi Stadium on the first night of the tour on Thursday, Aug. 3, too. The Totten’s are also going to the shows on Aug. 7-9 and Ramos women are headed to Aug. 7 and 9, too./nSo why all of the trouble and headaches just to see this one artist on tour?/nI joined Lori, Andrea, Tiffany and Emma on their ride to see Swift in Inglewood on Aug. 3 to find out that it wasn’t just about the music, there was much more to it./n“I just love what a phenomenal role model Taylor is for my kid,” Andrea said as we cruised down the 91 Freeway on the way to the show. “When ‘Reputation’ came out, Emma started having a stronger voice. It’s like ‘Reputation’ released Emma. Not to mention Taylor is just kind, generous and a great businesswoman.”/nEmma and Tiffany have known each other since about the age of three and grew up dancing competitively — even one year dressing up as Swifties with blonde bob wigs and dancing to Swift’s music./n“Aw, we are each other’s longest friend,” Emma realizes as the two, who are cozied in the back of the vehicle adjusting their “Folklore” and “Midnights” themed outfits and pondering aloud which secret songs Swift will play later that evening. (Spoiler alert: It was “Maroon” and “I Can See You (Taylor’s Version)”.)/n“I have a bracelet that says ‘I heart Mama Swift’ and I just think Taylor’s mom has to be such a great person to have raised such a great daughter,” Andrea said, referring to Swift’s mother, also named Andrea, who has become a rock star herself at her daughter’s shows, as she walks the venues to meet fans./n“I mean, the two of us are raising daughters, too, and it’s not easy,” she added./nI asked the young women why they liked Swift’s music and was met with a loud “Pffttt” and a laugh from Emma, the kind of response only a teenager could deliver without uttering, “Duh! My mom’s friend” at me./n“There are too many things, I can’t even name,” Tiffany offered./nAnd I very much believe she feels that way./nFor their mothers, it has become something special that they can share with their daughters./n“It’s something that Tiffany and I can bond over,” Lori said. “She has her music and I have mine, but this is our music. I also love that Taylor is so great with her fans and the music just makes me feel good.”/nFor Andrea, this is her final summer at home with Emma for now, who is heading to Indiana State University next year. As luck would have it, the day we were headed to Inglewood, Swift announced additional dates for The Eras Tour in 2024. And she’s hitting Indianapolis, not far from Emma’s new college, in November./n“We’re going to try to get tickets,” Andrea assures. “I just like that I have this time with Emma. I get to experience this with her.”/nLori is the first to admit she’s gone a little overboard this year with The Eras Tour, especially with her outfits. Since she’s going to four shows in Inglewood, she has a different outfit for each evening, all inspired by Swift’s costuming in her music videos or on previous tours. She did give my friends and me a fashion show the week before of each outfit, stuff she purchased off of Poshmark and Etsy and went to work bedazzling and glittering herself to make the looks just right. She did this for herself as well as for Tiffany and she laugh-cringes when she shares the outfits for four Southern California dates and the early stop in Nashville cost over a grand. She and Tiffany also made dozens of Swiftie friendship bracelets, each one with a Swift saying and song titles or lyrics, dates and more that meant something to them./nAnd because they’re both cat ladies, just like Swift, Lori made tiny little friendship bracelets for cats to give fellow cat-loving Swifties./n“It’s crazy how much those little beads cost,” she said with a laugh./nSome may think it’s insane to indulge so much in a silly little concert, but as these women put the final touches on their outfits and drew on glittery 13s on the backs of their hands (Swift’s favorite number), I watched them laugh, smile, hug and at time squeal in delight as they met other Swifties on the way up to the Stadium./nIt was almost like a scene from the new “Barbie” movie — instead of the normal “Hi, Barbie!” greeting inside Barbieland, it was “Hi, Swiftie” in Taylorland. They took pictures, traded bracelets with other fans and danced to the Swift songs that were being played outside the venue in anticipation for the big event./nThey scream-cried-sang and danced through the entire show and took lots of pictures and videos to post on social media. And, of course, they picked up more merch./n“It’s totally worth it,” Lori said of their Eras Tour experience.",0,228,Social impact,1

The pop icon has owned that many spaces inside the region for some time now, but this week is different./nSwift’s 1989 album surges on the Billboard 200, returning to the top 10 once again. The pop project rises noticeably thanks to the announcement that the set is going to be re-recorded and re-released.

The re-worked version of the Grammy-winning title is expected in late October./nAs her die-hard followers prepare for 1989 (Taylor’s Version), they are busy listening to the original.

Many of them have rocketed up the Spotify charts, and now all that listening has helped the title perform well once again./nThe set returns to the top 10 on the Billboard 200 once again, finding space inside the area for the first time in years. 1989 hasn’t been seen in the highest tier on the all-encompassing ranking of the most-consumed albums in America since early 2016, according to Billboard. This week, the title shifted another 45,000 equivalent units./nSurprisingly, despite the fact that the album has been out for eight years, it didn’t have far to climb. Last week, 1989 sat at No. 13 on the Billboard 200. Now, it’s up to No. 9, lifting four very important spaces./nSwift almost made history in another way, as she nearly claimed half of the top 10 on the Billboard 200. The singer’s other album Folklore falls out of the highest tier as 1989 advances. That title, which was another No. 1 in 2020, dips from No. 9 to No. 11. It’s also beaten by fellow Swift releases Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) at No. 5, Midnights at No. 6, and Lover at No. 7./n",1.528998952,229,Achievements,1

These can be tough choices, especially for artists who have a lot of music that's eligible, and there are always some hits that are left out in the cold./nTaylor Swift is one such artist who had to make some difficult choices, including not submitting her single ""Cruel Summer.""

The tune served as the lead smash from her most recent album of original material, Midnights. It debuted at No. 1 and is now her longest-charting hit on the Hot 100. Swift is likely headed for another nomination in both Record and Song of the Year with the chart-topper, and she's also submitted the tune for Best Pop Solo Vocal Performance./nSwift didn't want to compete against herself—either for nominations or votes—so she chose between ""Anti-Hero"" and ""Cruel Summer."" Both would have been serious contenders for the Best Pop Solo Vocal Performance Grammy, but if she focuses on only ""Anti-Hero,"" it might help voters select that tune as well when voting for bigger categories./nSwift is expected to be one of the top nominees at the award ceremony this year, and she may clean up, even collecting some honors she's never won before.

/nTaylor Swift has a number of empowering songs. Much of 1989 and Midnights is tailor-made to help you strut down the street with your head held high. Some of her bolstering tunes are on the sweeter or poignant side – “You’re On Your Own, Kid” – while others embrace the darker sides of life. “Vigilante Shit” is definitely the latter. /nThough we may not like to admit it, doing something bad can often feel so good. Somewhere deep inside all of us is a hankering for revenge. Swift calls upon that version of herself for this standout track from Midnights. /n[RELATED: Swiftie Runs 13.1 Miles at Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour]/nWe’ve uncovered the meaning behind many of Swift’s songs and, as always, there is a measure of speculation behind the meaning of “Vigilante Shit.” Swift never reveals her secrets. Though her fans are good at cracking codes, she never confirms their theories, leaving them to be just that – theories. As far as “Vigilante Shit” goes, there is one theory that seems to be tossed around the most. /nMany fans think “Vigilante Shit” is a coded berate toward Scooter Braun. With Braun being public enemy No. 1 in the Swiftian universe, fans can’t think of anyone else who could deserve this tongue-lashing more so than the music executive. /nYou did some bad things, but I’m the worst of themSometimes I wonder which one will be your last lieThey say looks can kill and I might try/nThroughout the lyrics, Swift references “crimes” against her that she feels the need to seek revenge for. Over the last few years, Swift has put an intense focus on her Taylor’s Version re-recordings – an act of revenge against Braun for selling her masters out from under her. With that drama firmly on the mind of Swift and her fans, one could ostensibly guess that the retribution plan Swift is singing about in “Vigilante Shit” could be about Braun. /nElsewhere she sings about not starting drama, but certainly finishing it, and not letting herself be sad at what has gone down, but aiming to get even. It all sounds very similar to Swift’s issue with Braun. Though of course, we may never know the exact meaning behind this track, this theory seems fitting enough to be a contender. /nShe don’t start it, but she can tell you how it endsDon’t get sad, get evenSo on the weekendsShe don’t dress for friendsLately she’s been dressing for revenge/n(Photo by Tom Cooper/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nSee more/nOnly members can comment.

[+] 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)/nFollowing Taylor Swift's announcement of a concert film from her The Eras Tour coming to theaters, Beyoncé has also revealed plans to release a hybrid concert movie and behind-the-scenes documentary centered around her Renaissance World Tour at AMC Theaters later this year. While both projects from these music icons may appear quite similar on the surface, there is one significant difference between them./nBeyoncé's movie primarily focuses on her Renaissance World Tour, which supported her album of the same name. The full-length took the world by storm in mid-2022, and the global tour concluded on October 1. According to Variety, Beyoncé's movie is tentatively scheduled to premiere in theaters on December 1./nBy the time Beyoncé's movie hits theaters, her Renaissance World Tour will have been over for months. This means that the film won't possibly cannibalize ticket sales, as the tour has already concluded. Those who purchase movie tickets are likely to do so either because they thoroughly enjoyed the live show and want to relive the experience, or because they missed out on getting tickets to the original tour./nIn contrast, Swift's movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, has a different release strategy. It is set to arrive in theaters on October 13, ahead of Beyoncé's film and in the middle of Swift's ongoing tour./nWhile Swift is on a brief hiatus from her tour in October, she'll resume her global trek in November with performances in South America, including countries like Argentina and Brazil. The tour picks back up again in early 2024, with dates scheduled through November 2024, including a second run across America./nSwift's immense popularity suggests that she isn't concerned about her concert film affecting ticket sales for her future shows. Many of her upcoming concerts have already sold out or almost sold out, and it's unlikely that the movie will deter anyone who wanted to attend her live performances from buying a ticket./nDemand for Swift's global tour remains exceptionally high, and it is nearly impossible for anything to hinder her chances of selling out even the biggest arenas and stadiums./nA similar sentiment likely would have applied to Beyoncé and her film. Both tours were significant pop culture moments, with millions of fans eager to attend concerts, even if they couldn't secure tickets. The main difference between the two films, apart from their likely box office appeal, is that Beyoncé's movie is arriving after the tour's conclusion, whereas Swift is comfortable using hers as a supplement to her ongoing tour, even if that move may appear counterintuitive./n",-7.875524599,234,Filmography,0

Others, like Mathur, only recently boarded the Swift train thanks to their daughters’ infectious enthusiasm for her music./nFor many, it was a little bit of both./n“The earlier eras like ‘Speak Now’ and ‘Fearless,’ I was really young, so … [my mom] played those albums for me,” said 14-year-old Sydney, who arrived at SoFi on Monday with her mother, Luchanna Hall. “I showed her ‘Folklore’ and her later albums.”/n Entertainment & Arts /nA guide to making your friendship bracelet trading experience at SoFi memorable — by Swifties for Swifties. /nAug. 1, 2023/nWhen asked who introduced whom to Swift’s catalog, Andrea Bendzick, 49, proudly proclaimed, “I introduced my daughter.” Bendzick first saw Swift live during the Fearless tour, then took her now-18-year-old daughter, Maddie, to see the “Enchanted” singer during her “Speak Now” era./nThe gift of Swift is something that Maddie appreciates.  She said that listening to the Grammy winner’s music helped build a generational bridge of common interest with her mom./n“Taylor is one of the only artists that I feel has accurately described what it means to grow up as a woman,” Maddie said. /n“Having my mom introduce me to her at such a young age sort of helped me grow through music and just helped me connect to something that we could both relate to.”/n California /nOn the third night of Taylor Swift’s marathon of SoFi Stadium shows for her sold-out Eras tour, fans shared how the songwriter’s music had changed their lives./nAug. 7, 2023/nMaddie’s 21-year-old cousin Olivia, who was there with her mom, Mildred Bay, echoed that sentiment./n“Almost every single one of Taylor’s songs is so relatable for every woman,” Olivia shared. “It’s just very cool, especially in this environment, to see how many people outside of our family are also connected to Taylor through her music.”/nBay, who came down from Washington state to attend her first Swift concert, said she was excited to share this moment with her daughter and would follow her daughter’s lead on how to conduct herself. “I’m just along for the ride,” she said./nBendzick, the Orange County native whose favorite Swift era is “Red,” knew she would introduce her daughter to Swift at an early age because she understood the importance of having a positive role model for her child to obsess over./n“If your child, especially your daughter, is going to have a role model, she’s gonna take it very, very seriously,” Bendzick said. /n“It’s something that I’ve noticed as a mom. You’re very aware all the time of who’s influencing your kids and the messages they’re sending. And I think she sends a very strong message, especially to young girls.” /nOn the first of a six-night stretch at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, the Swifties packed the streets in their glitter and glam, but they weren’t the only ones surrounding the stadium that night./nAug. 4, 2023/nHall also hailed Swift as an “inspirational” figure and “great role model” for her children. When her daughters were suddenly out of school because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift  and the three albums she released in rapid succession during that time  were there for them./n“She just seems to be a positive reinforcement to women,” the 47-year-old finance professional observed, “and we think that’s so important, especially raising two daughters.”/nMultiple mothers credited Swift’s songs with helping them engage in meaningful conversations with their daughters./nMathur recalled the moment her daughter asked her about Swift’s pro-LGBTQ+ anthem “You Need to Calm Down.” The music video for the 2019 single — which celebrated prominent LGBTQ+ figures from Laverne Cox to RuPaul — marked a turning point for Swift, who had previously been more guarded about her personal values./nThe song signaled a turning point for the Mathur family as well./n“It was [Suraiya’s] first time understanding gay pride and people who are different,” Mathur told The Times. “That song really helped us talk about it as a mother and daughter, and she understands everything, so I thought it was … a really good introduction.”/n Music /nTaylor Swift kicked off six sold-out shows at SoFi Stadium, and The Times’ Mikael Wood and Suzy Exposito were there to provide a full rundown./nAug. 3, 2023/nSuraiya — who wore face jewels and a “Be Happy” friendship bracelet to Monday’s show — said she had already learned about the LGBTQ+ community from her dad. But discussing the themes of “You Need to Calm Down” with her mom helped her “understand it better.”/n“What did you say to me [at the time]?” Mathur asked her daughter. “You said anyone can love anyone?”/n“Yeah!” Suraiya said confidently, before giggling and adding, “I don’t remember.”/nAnother Swift song with a message to impart, “The Man,” helped Linda Deitch educate her 9-year-old daughter, Eden, about issues related to gender discrimination. The 53-year-old attorney from Culver City and her daughter also discussed Swift’s decision to rerecord her back catalog in an effort “to gain control again over things that she felt had been taken away from her by somebody.”/n“We talked about … how [Swift] wondered if she would have been treated differently in her profession and in her life if she had been a man, and why she might think that,” Deitch said./n Music /nCultural dominance.

Report
/n/nTaylor Swift, 33, and Travis Kelce, 33, are already thinking about dressing up in couple Halloween costumes, according to Daily Mail. The new lovebirds have reportedly been planning on dressing up as someone or something memorable for the upcoming holiday, including Barbie and Ken, from the big hit movie this year. A source told the outlet that the singer and football player have been ejoying the “whirlwind” that’s surrounded their romance./n“The whirlwind that this relationship has started is something that Taylor is familiar with, and Travis is OK with,” the source shared. “He wants to get in as much time as possible with her before she embarks on her international tour.”/nHeidi Klum has also said she would “love” to invite Taylor and Travis to her annual Halloween bash, which has been attended by many celebrities over the years. :I would love to invite them,” the model told Daily Mail. “If they would just show up, I’m sure no one at the door will turn them away. Unless the costume is so strong that no one recognizes them, like mine.”/nAs far as Taylor and Travis’ plans for Halloween night, the insider said Heidi’s party is a “big option,” but they aren’t sure where they’ll go quite yet. “Heidi Klum’s Halloween party is a very big option for them to attend, they haven’t made it 100 percent, but since they have made things official in other ways that they have even started a relationship, they are really feeling it all out and they might want to make that night be the night they go, red carpet official,” the insider explained./n“This is the relationship they put themselves into, and they are prepared to see it through and see where it goes and are looking to take advantage of everything it brings on the outside along with the personal enjoyment that comes from it,” the insider added./nThe news of Taylor and Travis’ possible Halloween plans comes less than a week after the “Midnight Rain” crooner made headlines for attending Travis’ football game with the Kansas City Chiefs in Kansas City, MO. She was photographed and filmed cheering on the athlete, along with his mom, Donna Kelce, while standing in his VIP suite. They were later seen leaving Arrowhead Stadium, where the game took place, and riding off in a convertible together./n

245,,You don't have to be a Swiftie to love Taylor Swift. The Eras tour movie premiere proves it,"As influential as her music is, Taylor Swift's legacy is most clearly reflected in the devotion on display at the world premiere of her new concert film.",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2023-10-11/taylor-swift-eras-tour-concert-film-premiere-los-angeles-grove,latimes,general,us,2023-10-12T06:28:17+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,245,"Swarms of Swifties descended on the AMC Grove 14 for the premiere of “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert film on Wednesday, an event so insanely anticipated that those of us lucky enough to be on the invite list were informed of its location mere hours before showtime./nSecurity was tight, with the swanky outdoor mall transformed into a maze of portable hedges over which helicopters hovered — loud enough to drown out the Swift songs playing on the sound system./nBut not the screams of the Swifties as they encountered one another, learned of their idol’s arrival via TikTok or saw her posing on the red carpet that snaked past Coach and Barnes and Noble. /n /nSeeing the girls with hand-to-elbow wristbands, sparkly cowboy boots and matching gold fringe dresses as I entered the theater, I confess I felt something of a fraud./nI am not a Swiftie./nIt could be age or excessive exposure to elementary-school talent-show renditions of “Love Story” and “You Belong with Me.” Or perhaps I, like the Grinch, simply have a heart two sizes too small. Whatever the reason, I would no more pay hundreds, never mind thousands, of dollars to see an Eras tour concert than I would shell out for Manolos or hire sherpas to pull me up Mt. Everest./n(I have just been told, by the resident 17-year-old who is reading over my shoulder, that anyone who does not appreciate the glory that is “Love Story” must be, in fact, heartless.)/nI was, however, very much looking forward to seeing Swift’s new concert movie./n /nNot, perhaps, as much as the woman who sobbed to cameras outside the parking structure about how she has been living for this because Swift means so much to her./n /nOr the hundreds of fans who lined the red-carpeted main thoroughfare of the Grove, straining for a sight of their idol./nOr even Grove owner Rick Caruso, who strolled among the crowds immediately outside the theater, mayor of all he could see. /nStill, I have been known to sing along to “Mean” with my daughters on the way to soccer games or do a little “Shake It Off” twist. And I was very happy for Kansas City when Swift decided to date one of its football stars. /nProof that you don’t have to be a Swiftie to understand why so many others are. /nYou don’t have to be instantly transported by her every song like so many appear to be at her sold-out concerts. To admire the many stands she has taken (including calling out Scooter Braun long before everyone else fired him) or appreciate the outsize role she plays in the culture of female and artist empowerment./nA love of fringe dresses is not required to respect her work registering voters or as an LGBTQ activist. Even those not panting for the upcoming re-release of “1989” (which is predicted to be her biggest sales week ever) can applaud her decision to re-record her old albums so she would finally own her work, or to hand out $55 million in bonuses to crew members, including truckers. I don’t own a friendship bracelet but I still bow before her ability to boost local economies and inspire childlike awe from the NFL./n Entertainment & Arts /nSince Swift was spotted watching Travis Kelce at Sunday’s Chiefs game, many have wondered what it means for the NFL. But what about Kansas City?/nSept. 28, 2023/n /nEven at the world premiere she was putting in the work — and not just on the red carpet. As the 7 p.m. showtime pushed well past eight, folks were starting to fidget. Until Swift sashayed into the room, at least: Just to say hi, give a shout out to her dancers (some of whom were in the audience) and thank everyone for coming. In each of the AMC Grove’s 14 theaters./n /nThis is a woman who takes her work, her success and herself seriously. And even now that is a rare and wonderful thing to behold./nAt 33, she has never abandoned her young followers or voiced, as other young stars have, a desire to move past her established fan base. Her music may have matured, but she remains committed to songs about love and the struggle for identity. She has appeared in movies and TV shows, but does not aspire to be a movie or TV star. And though she is slated to make her feature writing/directing debut for Searchlight — a logical next step after helming her own music videos — it’s with the Eras tour, a journey through her own musical history, that she has established herself as one of the most popular and powerful performers of all time./nMore than anything, Taylor Swift values what she does and takes pleasure in doing it well — which has made her a beacon for everyone who wants to feel the same./n /nIt wasn’t easy. White, blond, tall and thin, her looks have worked, as is so often the case with female artists, for and against her. Easily loved and easily dismissed, she benefited from being seen as “the girl next door,” and was simultaneously saddled with a trope traditionally reserved for white women. In 2009, when Kanye West hijacked her acceptance speech for the MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video of the Year, she found herself, at 19, in the center of an acrimonious conversation about race in the music industry, portrayed, at best, as a victim and, at worst, a symptom of a larger problem. /nOver the years, Swift has been mocked for the often autobiographical nature of her songs — when not alluding to bad behavior by old beaux, she often pushed back against critics and producers. Her deft use of social media, the ultimate marketing tool of the 21st century, was seen as either canny or manipulative. (Um, it’s marketing.)/n /nBut her habit of standing up for herself was not limited to lyrics. In 2013, after a Colorado DJ groped her during a photo op, Swift, then 23, reported it and the DJ was fired. When, two years later, he sued her for defamation, Swift countersued for battery and assault and won./nThen, in 2015, she spoke out against Apple not paying writers, artists and producers during the free three-month trial of their new music service. Some saw her as a champion, others as a spoiled millionaire star. Either way Apple began paying for the music./nAnd in 2019, Swift’s battle against mega-producer Braun and the equity company that helped him acquire Big Machine Label, which owned much of her work, exposed problems that were discussed in the halls of Congress./nNot surprisingly, being the center of such wildly vacillating public opinion took its toll. When Donald Trump became president in 2016, Swift was excoriated by some for campaigning on behalf of Hilary Clinton. Lana Wilson’s 2020 documentary “Miss Americana” captures the isolation of an artist who literally cannot leave her home without stirring up an anthill of fans (some of whom are more predatory than others) as she decides, against the advice of everyone in the room, that it’s time to use her voice politically./nSo the screaming fans and sold-out concerts really aren’t a surprise, any more than rapturous singing-and-dancing-in-the-aisles reception the concert film received at its premiere. /n /nIn culture increasingly bereft of role models, Swift, whose biggest scandal to date involved the overuse of her private jet, is a genuinely aspirational figure. Even the nightmare many fans faced over getting Eras tickets forced local and national politicians to begin looking into Ticketmaster’s exorbitant fees./nLike her music or hate it, Taylor Swift has raised a generation of fans to take themselves seriously and fight for what they believe in./nAnd you know what? “Love Story” and “You Should Be With Me” are damn good songs./nMaybe there’s more than one way to be a Swiftie after all. /nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

Fans worldwide are buzzing with excitement over this project, and Swift has kicked off the campaign in style with an intriguing teaser./nIn a little over a month, Taylor Swift will unveil her re-recorded rendition of the iconic album 1989. Fans are eagerly counting down the days until its release, and the singer-songwriter has recently dropped an enticing teaser that has set social media abuzz./nOn September 19, Swift took to her social media channels to share an animated video that quickly went viral that teases some of the most anticipated tunes on her forthcoming album. The captivating clip featured a vault set against a light blue backdrop, which promptly swung open to reveal a series of letters, an exclamation point, and quotation marks./nSwift's dedicated fanbase was quick to speculate that the letters may spell out the title of one of the songs that will be labeled ""From The Vault"" on 1989 (Taylor's Version). In her re-released projects, the singer not only re-records the original tracks but also treats fans to a selection of songs that were penned and recorded during the initial album's creation but remained unreleased until now./nThese animated teasers have become a signature move for Swift with each re-recorded album, and they provide fans with hints about what to expect from the forthcoming release. While the possibilities are endless, the prevailing theory is that Swift is inviting fans to decipher one of the five new tracks set to join the 1989 (Taylor's Version) tracklist./nThe letters could potentially spell out ""Lust!"" or, for some playful fans online, ""Slut!"" However, given the song's era and target audience during its original creation, it's more likely to be the former. 1989 marked Swift's significant transition into radio-ready pop, making a track titled ""Slut!"" an improbable fit for the album's overall theme and sound...though it’s certainly not impossible./nUltimately, the mystery surrounding the song's title will persist until Swift either unveils the complete tracklist for 1989 (Taylor's Version) or the album itself drops. The Grammy-winning artist has a knack for dropping hints without revealing everything, keeping her devoted fanbase engaged and eagerly awaiting every detail./n",-5.895710052,252,Discography,1

After only a few days, the set quickly became not just a sales success but the top title in America this year./nAccording to Billboard, 1989 (Taylor's Version) now ranks as the top-selling album in America in 2023. The title earned that honor after only five days of availability. 1989 (Taylor's Version) is not necessarily the biggest album of the year when including streaming equivalents—which factor into the year-end rankings and many of the weekly Billboard charts—but rather, it's the bestseller./nBillboard states that after its first five days out in the world, 1989 (Taylor's Version) hit one million copies sold in America alone. It's extremely rare for any release to actually sell one million copies in the U.S. these days, as streaming has taken over as the primary way for millions to consume music. Swift is one of a very small number of artists who can still sell albums and songs in massive quantities./n1989 (Taylor's Version) will almost surely open at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in a few days when the chart is refreshed.

The speculation reached a fever pitch as the first U.S. leg of her highly anticipated The Eras Tour drew to a close. The excitement surrounding this possible and expected announcement was palpable both before and during the show, and Swift certainly did not disappoint her dedicated legion of followers./nThe final concert of her six-show streak at Los Angeles's iconic SoFi Stadium made for the perfect moment for Swift to drop a bombshell. During the show, the singer officially revealed her next musical endeavor—the release of her re-recorded album, 1989 (Taylor’s Version)./nThis full-length holds a special place in Swift's discography as her first foray into the pure pop. Fans won't have to wait long to relive the magic that they first experienced a decade ago, as 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is set to hit the shelves on October 27./nSwift playfully built up the moment before making the announcement, as she knew exactly what she was ding. Stopping the show and addressing the eagerly awaiting crowd, the star shared her excitement about the revelation she was about to make. She said that rather than simply tell everyone the news she had, she wanted to show them./nIn a dramatic display, the massive screen behind her momentarily plunged into darkness before illuminating an image that instantly became iconic for her most die-hard followers—the cover art for 1989 (Taylor’s Version) along with its much-anticipated release date./nAs the image of the album cover and street date splashed across the screen, the stadium erupted into a frenzy of cheers and screams.

Universal’s “The Exorcist: Believer” finished a distant second with $11 million for a domestic total of $44.9 million through its second weekend./nThe blockbuster opening was the highest ever for a concert film, more than tripling the $31 million earned by Miley Cyrus’ “Best of Both Worlds” debut in 2008. More impressively, the film took in more in its first weekend than any concert film has in its entire run in the past 50 years, topping “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,” which earned a total of $73 million domestically in 2011. (The granddaddy of concert films, 1970’s “Woodstock,” remains, for now, the most commercially successful of all time, with an inflation-adjusted box office gross of more than $270 million.) “The Eras Tour”  movie also stands neck-and-neck with “Joker,” which opened with $96.2 million in 2019, as the biggest October release of all time./nWhat makes the  picture’s enormous haul even more remarkable is that six weeks ago it wasn’t even on anyone’s radar. Swift  announced the film’s existence only on Aug. 31, forging a groundbreaking direct distribution deal with AMC Theatres under which she will reportedly earn 57% of the  movie’s revenues, with AMC taking the rest. (Typically, film release dates are set months, and sometimes years, in advance, with studios and theaters splitting grosses roughly evenly.)/n Movies /nWith “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” now in theaters, we choose the concert films that redefined the form. Even at home, you’ll be out of your seat, dancing./nOct. 13, 2023/nThe success of “The Eras Tour” comes on the heels of A24’s re-release of Talking Heads’ 1984 classic “Stop Making Sense,” which has grossed more than $4 million and which could herald a paradigm shift for concert movies. In recent years, such live-music fare has often hit the big screen as limited, one- or two-night events, as with the Coldplay and BTS concert films released earlier this year. In the wake of Swift’s deal with AMC, Beyoncé announced earlier this month that a film based on her “Renaissance” tour will hit theaters on Dec. 1 under a similar arrangement with the distributor./nFor the theater chain, which has been struggling financially in recent years, cutting out the middle man to strike an agreement directly with a mega-star like Swift can provide a much-needed boost to its bottom line. But Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore, says other musicians shouldn’t necessarily start hounding their managers to try to score them the kind of deal that Swift and Beyoncé have./n“People keep saying, ‘Will this now open the floodgates?’ ” Dergarabedian says. “Well, that would presume there’s a deep bench of musical artists who could create this kind of demand for a concert movie. It’s a great formula for success for this very unique style of release with very unique artists that operate in an orbit that very few stars do in any realm. Taylor Swift is in her own orbit and has this gravitational pull on everything else.”/nIndeed, Swift is a veritable one-woman marketing machine. With just a handful of Instagram posts, she could drum up the kind of publicity it would take a studio tens of millions of dollars to generate. Merely by showing up Thursday night to cheer on her rumored boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in the team’s NFL game against the Denver Broncos, Swift created several million more social-media impressions to fuel the movie’s box office./nSwift’s juggernaut tour is already on track to take in more than $2 billion. (By comparison, the total box office for the year is expected to land at around $9 billion.) In offering fans the chance to see her show for a fraction of the hundreds of dollars they might have to shell out to see it live, the pop superstar — who is also releasing a new album, “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” this month — is further expanding the already massive reach of the Taylor-verse. (Swift, who has acted in a handful of  movies, including the box office duds “Cats” and “Amsterdam,” is also set to direct her first feature film for Searchlight Pictures from her own original script.)/nHeading into the weekend, theater owners braced themselves for Taylormania to bring out large and potentially raucous crowds. At the film’s premiere Wednesday night in Los Angeles, which shut down the usually bustling outdoor mall the Grove, Swift herself was seen dancing in her seat in time with the choreographed moves on the screen. /n“I’ve never had this much fun in my life as I have had on the Eras tour,” the singer told the crowd, which included Beyoncé, along with other celebrity Swifties like Adam Sandler, Simu Liu, Jennifer Garner and Mariska Hargitay. “It is far and away just the most electric experience of my life.”/nReviews for “The Eras Tour,” which runs nearly three hours and is focused purely on Swift’s stage show, with no backstage scenes or other documentary elements, have been overwhelmingly positive. (Director Sam Wrench has helmed concert films for artists like Billie Eilish and Lizzo.) Breaking it down with Times music writer Mikael Wood,  movie critic Justin Chang wrote, “Again and again, in between private stretches of partial tune recognition, my jaw dropped at the sheer visual grandeur of the thing.”/nAccording to Dergarabedian, the buzz of this summer’s “Barbenheimer” phenomenon — and in particular the flocks of young women who turned out in pink for “Barbie” — helped set the stage for the success of Swift’s film. /n“I’m sure ‘Barbenheimer’ was on Swift and her team’s radar,” Dergarabedian says. “That showed the world how the movie theater as a hub of influence can provide an exponentially stronger footprint in terms of revenue, social media and brand identification. Artists like Swift and Beyoncé live and breathe the communal experience, and that’s what the movie theater is.”/nWith the theatrical business still struggling to return to its pre-pandemic health — a recovery process that has been hampered by this year’s strikes in Hollywood — the success of “The Eras Tour” provides a much-needed shot in the arm. And for the music industry, it is certain to drive interest in finding similarly innovative, DIY ways to leverage the thrill of seeing live music on a big screen./n“Believe me, every boardroom at every major label is looking at this because of the halo effect it can bring,” Dergarabedian says. “Music and movies coming together is like peanut butter and chocolate.

That’s a higher percentage than the norm, and the discrepancy is due to Swift's decision to pursue a non-traditional rollout plan by partnering directly with AMC, a company with limited experience in film distribution, especially for a project of this magnitude. Essentially, Swift cut out the middleman, resulting in greater rewards for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour./nIt's important to note that the reported $60 million is based solely on pre-sold tickets. This figure is likely to increase significantly in the coming weeks and months as the film continues to play in theaters, attracting millions of fans. The total box office earnings will grow, as will Swift's overall earnings./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is reported to have cost between $10 and $20 million to produce, so it has already made back its production budget several times over. Even before its theatrical release, it appears that Swift has potentially earned between three to six times the film's production cost, and its profitability is only expected to increase from this point onwards./n",0,265,Filmography,1

There has been talk about how much Kelce’s jersey sales have spiked since he began dating Swift, and now there are reports saying she will attend the Chiefs’ Week 4 game./nAs the Kelce-Swift relationship has taken over the news cycle, it’s fair to wonder whether the relationship is real or fake./nWhat are some signals that the relationship might be a publicity stunt? Typically when athletes and entertainers are in relationships, they try to keep things more private. They don’t freely admit on their podcast or show that they are dating. Photos and videos of them leaving a stadium and hanging out later don’t tend to leak out so readily. /nThe initial report about them dating came from a website called The Messenger, which also had a followup story they blasted out to other media sites. How is a newcomer to the game getting these stories so easily?/nAnd when Swift was at Sunday’s game, it’s not like she was hidden or trying to keep things private. She was as public as possible, sitting in a luxury suite next to Kelce’s mother. FOX also showed her as many times as possible, as if they were given permission — if not outright instructions — to feature her often./nThen a report came out on Wednesday saying Swift would be at Sunday night’s game. That report oddly came from a sports media reporter, not a gossip website. If the news leaked out as part of relationship/gossip talk, that would seem more fitting. But the news coming from a sports media reporter seems like it’s a coordinated effort between some folks involved in sports media./nBREAKING: Taylor Swift is expected to attend the @Chiefs at @nyjets game in person to support Travis Kelce, sources tell @FOS./nHer appearance could create huge TV ratings for NBC Sports' ""Sunday Night Football."" https://t.co/GvJbzIgIyq/n— Michael McCarthy (@MMcCarthyREV) September 27, 2023/n/nIf the relationship is indeed a publicity stunt, trying to figure out how it started is a good question. Did the NFL spearhead and coordinate the efforts? Did the publicists for each respective party make it happen? Who knows, but the whole thing seems to be very carefully coordinated and is producing the intended effect./nSince Taylor Swift showed up to Sunday's Chiefs-Bears game:/n• 400% spike in Travis Kelce jersey sales• Kelce's podcast ranks #1 overall on Apple• Kelce adds 383K Instagram followers• 24.3M viewers watch, #1 game this week• 63% jump in female viewers age 18-49• 3x… pic.twitter.com/Wqtu1vgMCT/n— Front Office Sports (@FOS) September 26, 2023/n/nAnd if you’re wondering why all the parties would have interest in a fake relationship, the answers are obvious. For the NFL and the Chiefs, it’s increased attention and publicity. The same goes for Kelce, who will now be famous with an entirely new audience, similar to what happened with Lamar Odom when he began dating Khloe Kardashian. His career after football is now made. He and his brother have also made it clear they crave attention beyond what they do on the field when they created their podcast last year. What could be better for their post-football careers than this sort of attention?/nAnd for Swift, this further increases her popularity. And who knows?

/n/n“It was amazing,” she said. “I got everything I wanted, even the blue, crew-neck (sweater),” the same type of garment Swift wore on the album cover. Her cost for the haul: $1,400./nFandom bordering on worship was evident even 36 hours before Swift was scheduled to take the stage on Thursday for the first of six sell-out shows at the lavish $5 billion stadium. Swifties, as they are called, chatted, befriended one another and waited, and waited in a queue that wrapped along District Drive all the way out to Century Boulevard./nThis is not your typical concert. This was an early peek at what will be an invasion mostly of teenagers, mothers and millennials from all parts of Southern California and beyond to see the celebrated pop star who has won 12 Grammy Awards, sold 114 million album units worldwide including 3% of the total album sales from all artists in 2022 and thereby becoming the top-selling act that year./nThe entertainment publication, Variety, estimates the concerts on Aug. 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9 will bring 420,000 people to SoFi, and those are the ones with tickets. At other concerts, non-ticketholders gather outside and sing, Tayle-gate and just party while the show plays on inside the arena./nTo handle the crush, LA Metro will keep its train lines running two hours longer than normal, until 2 a.m. to take concert-goers back home. Likewise, Metro is running two shuttle buses directly to SoFi: One from the K (Crenshaw) Line’s Downtown Inglewood Station and the other from the C (Green) Line’s Hawthorne/Lennox Station in the middle of the 105 Freeway. The shuttles will run 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. before each show, and for 90 minutes after the concerts./nMetro will increase the number of Metro Ambassadors at Union Station and key K, E and C Line stations, pointing the way to the correct train, bus or shuttle, said Tracy Smith, Metro spokesperson on Wednesday. Customer service teams will be at tables selling TAP cards and helping riders fund them. It costs $1.75 per ride on a Metro train or bus. The extra shuttles are free./n“It’s important for all of these people to see the ease of taking Metro and say, ‘Why didn’t I think of this before and leave my car at home,’ ” Smith said. Metro is hoping to use these special promotions as lures to attract regular riders in the future to a system many feel is unsafe./nAt other concerts in New York, New Jersey and Chicago, many Swifties rode the subways and buses, something that LA Metro has studied, she said. In the East Bay, the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority broke a record for one night of rides after Swift’s concert at Levi’s Stadium. The L.A. transit agency hopes the same thing happens in car-centric Los Angeles./nBut reports from other venues say the concert-goers also use ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. But these folks will pay between $100 and $200 a ride, some concert-goers reported./nUber is expecting more than 10,000 requests for each night of the concert, wrote Zahid Arab, Uber western region spokesman in an emailed response. And when Uber gets busy, prices go up./n“As is the case for most major events, dynamic pricing can go into effect during periods when demand for rides is at its highest,” Arab wrote. “For the Taylor Swift concert, this means that rates could increase towards the end of the night and when she finishes performing, as a high volume of guests may be looking for rides from SoFi Stadium.”/nAllie Priore, 32 of Burbank, is going to the Aug. 9 concert with friends. She checked out prices for an Uber ride and said the costs were around $125 each way. “They are upcharging. It normally doesn’t cost that much.” Instead, she and her friends are carpooling in one car to wait out the line of vehicles exiting the parking lot after the show./nAnd they will pay the $200 for parking at SoFi, she said, which may actually be less than if they took Uber each way, she said. “We’ll be like real moms, bringing water and snacks,” she said with a chuckle./nCeline Castaneda, 20, of Long Beach, is planning on hiring a Lyft ride Thursday morning at 8 a.m. Yes, that’s right, 8 a.m. for a concert that starts at 6:30 p.m. She will join the long merchandise line as soon as she arrives, which could last several hours./nShe, too, is hoping to buy the sought-after crew-neck sweater and enjoy meeting other Swifties at her first-ever Taylor Swift concert. And she’s making friendship bracelets, something Swifties embraced from a lyric of her song that says: “Make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it.”/nFor related news, see: SoFi Stadium’s Taylor Swift merch sale brings out the masses – a day before the shows even begin/nPriore said she’ll skip the merchandise line and order from online sites instead. She’s been to three Swift concerts and knows the drill. But for Castaneda, the bloom is still on the rose, despite months of effort to buy one ticket for $300./n“If I get a sweater that I buy from a Taylor Swift concert, the first concert seeing my hero, this will be like a keepsake for me,” said Castaneda./nCastaneda plans on staying long after the last note of the concert is sung, perhaps dreaming of a what if scenario. “I would love to meet her. If I did meet her I’d probably faint.”/nFor Celine Daire of Los Angeles, who waited 5 1/2 hours in line Wednesday to buy $503 worth of merchandise, she wanted to squeeze every drop of the experience out of what will be her first concert, with her sisters. “It was totally worth it. Everyone was nice and we made friends in line,” she said./nFor Los Angeles, this friendship thing among strangers may seem a little more country, a tad more Midwest than independent LA. But that’s changing for the next week./n“For the next six or seven nights, we will all be Swifties,” said Smith./nPhotographer Brittany Murray and Staff Writer Christina Merino contributed to this story./n ",0,267,Tour,1

After days of swirling rumors that Kelce and Swift are dating, Swift’s appearance at the game instantly took over social media. Videos of Swift passionately cheering on Kelce—in one instance, appearing to yell “let’s f*cking go” after Kelce made a touchdown—went viral. Kelce had invited Swift to the game on Thursday during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show: “""I told her that I've seen her rock a stage in Arrowhead and she might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead,"" Kelce said. After the game, Swift and Kelce were spotted driving away together in his convertible./n“I’m not going to talk about my personal life,” Kelce said through laughs in an interview with NFL Network in August after being asked about Swift. “I know what you writers want to hear. And you want to hear more about that, and I’m not going to give you anything.”/nKelce first suggested he was interested in Swift in July, when he revealed on his New Heights podcast he made a bracelet with his phone number on it which he intended to give to Swift at her Kansas City Eras Tour stop. He didn’t get to meet her or give her the bracelet and joked that he “took it personal,” but praised the show. Speculation the pair may be dating ramped up after The Messenger reported last week they have been “quietly hanging out.” Some fans noticed Swift wore a necklace embedded with Kelce’s birthstone, an opal, while in New York on September 8, leading to speculation whether the necklace was a reference to their rumored relationship. Without mentioning Swift, Kelce said on Kristin Cavallari’s Let’s Be Honest podcast Tuesday it’s going to “take some time” to “really dive into a relationship with somebody.”/nSwift’s dating rumors with Kelce come months after she reportedly dated The 1975 singer Matty Healy for several weeks. The rumored relationship came under fire, both from Swift’s fans and otherwise, for Healy’s history of controversial comments, including remarks joking about rapper Ice Spice’s ethnicity and accusations he used the Black Lives Matter movement to promote his own music.

In fact, the film has reportedly already earned enough in ticket sales to more than cover its budget, weeks before it hits theaters./nAccording to Puck, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour reportedly cost somewhere between $10 and $20 million to make. It’s not clear if that sum covers only the filming of the movie, which took place at her Los Angeles shows, or if it also includes marketing, distribution, and more. That’s a very healthy figure for a concert doc, and it might be hard for some musicians to earn it back…but not for Swift./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour sold historically well when pre-sale tickets were first made available by AMC, the theater chain carrying and distributing the film. According to Variety, which reported on claims made by AMC, the movie brought in $26 million in ticket sales in just its first three hours of its pre-sale window. So, it seems that Swift managed to make back the millions that it cost to produce the documentary of sorts within less than a quarter of a day./nAfter tickets had been available for a full day, that sum climbed even higher.

(Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift is the queen of surprise drops and hidden messages, so any time there’s the remotest of chances that something attached to the superstar might be foreshadowing what’s to come, her fans jump at it and set the internet abuzz with speculation. It has only been a few weeks since the release of her latest re-recorded album, but Swifties have already clocked what might be a hint about her next project. This time, the tantalizing clue didn't come directly from the singer herself but from an unexpected source./nAs Swift's massively successful The Eras Tour continues, with her next stop being in Los Angeles, fans noticed something intriguing in a tweet from the SoFi Stadium, where she is set to headline for six nights. Shortly before she’s set to begin her residency (of sorts), the venue tweeted, ""Only 3 more days until @taylorswift13. We are so excited to welcome her to Los Angeles: (Taylor's Version).""/nWhile the message might seem simple at first glance, it's the accompanying images that have Swifties in a frenzy. The tweet included four pictures, and one of them caught the attention of eagle-eyed fans. It featured a lifeguard shack on the beach, with the numbers ""1989"" written on the wood, along with the text ""(Taylor's Version)"" below it—all edited to ensure the words were clear to see./nThe significance of this image lies in the fact that 1989 is the title of one of Swift's most iconic albums, originally released in 2014. With the text ""(Taylor's Version)"" clearly indicated, it strongly suggests that 1989 might be the next album Swift chooses to re-record and re-release./nBut that's not all. Another image in the tweet depicted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, except instead of someone's name, it read ""Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)."" ""Wildest Dreams"" is one of Swift's well-known singles, and one of the top 10 hits from 1989. The fact that a re-recorded version of it could potentially appear on the as-yet-unannounced 1989 (Taylor's Version) adds even more weight to the speculation. Swift actually already released ""Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)"" a while back as a one-off treat for fans, but the fact that it’s being mentioned again wasn’t missed by her followers./nSo far, Swift has already re-recorded and re-released three of her first six albums – Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), and Speak Now (Taylor's Version). Each of these albums has achieved considerable success, hitting No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and spawning numerous Hot 100 hits./nThis re-recording project was born out of Swift's desire to reclaim ownership of her music after the rights to her original recordings were sold away from her. Taking matters into her own hands, she aims to regain control and preserve her artistic legacy...and score some major chart wins in the process./nAs for the exact timeline for 1989 (Taylor's Version) or any other potential re-recordings, no official announcements have been made. It is evident that Swift is hard at work, not only on her new projects but also on these re-recordings. A hint like this one could possibly mean something, but when it comes to Swift, who loves a good Easter Egg, chances are it is exactly what many fans assume it means./n",6.138070932,270,Discography,0

Well, it didn't face any real competition, that's for sure./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour had no issue going right to No. 1 and ruling the box office, as no other title could compete with the concert film.

That's just one-eighth of what Swift's production managed./nThe Exorcist: Believer actually opened earlier than expected, as it moved to avoid competing directly with Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. After the singer announced her release date, several movies changed theirs, with this horror flick being perhaps the highest-profile to change course. Since opening on October 6, the title has earned $45 million at the box office—less than half of what Swift managed in one weekend./nLooking at the top 10 highest-grossing movies this weekend in America, it becomes even clearer that Swift really owned the box office this time around. The combined grosses of the top 10 titles—excluding Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour—is just under $36 million. That's less than half of what Swift's concert movie pulled in./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour actually outsold the rest of the top 50 grossing movies in America this past weekend—combined—with room to spare. That list includes quite a few relatively unknown titles, such as Carlos Santana's documentary Santana ($3,171), Liam Neeson's Retribution ($3,506), as well as ongoing blockbusters that are still in theaters, like Oppenheimer ($313,755) and Barbie ($475,664)./nThe $93 million that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour earned marks the second largest debut in theaters for a movie arriving in October, according to CNBC. The singer's concert film came close to matching the all-time record, which is still held by Joker. That picture, which opened in October 2019, earned a little more than $96 million in its opening weekend./n",0,272,Filmography,1

Self-interested hotel union Unite Here Local 11./nFor related news, see: Politicians urge Taylor Swift to postpone LA concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers/nIn a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times, the union called on Swift to postpone her show in “solidarity” with striking hotel workers. Several of the union’s elected allies have predictably chimed in, arguing that Swift should respect the union’s cause. Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis was shameless enough to join the protest, despite having just seen Swift in Santa Clara the weekend prior./nNotably missing from the list of boycott endorsers: Inglewood Mayor James Butts, not to mention the countless small businesses and disappointed fans who would lose out if Swift skipped SoFi./nThe union’s demand is an unusual one: Swift herself is not in the middle of a labor dispute. Indeed, Swift made news in recent days by awarding her road crew up to $100,000 each as a personal thank you for the hard work during the tour. She’s also partnered with local charitable organizations on her tour stops, such as a food bank in Santa Clara./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nIt’s hard to imagine a more pro-worker perspective, and seemingly one that Los Angeles would welcome to town./nBut according to Local 11’s twisted logic, Swift is obligated to reschedule because her visiting fans will be staying at LA-area hotels, including some of the hotels where workers may currently be on strike. This selfish perspective is on-brand for Local 11, which in recent weeks has made news for deliberately disrupting a wedding and 4th of July tourism to advance its goals during the strike./nRelated Articles

Set aside for a minute the flawed argument that the entire LA economy should suffer because of labor disputes at a handful of union properties. The fault for the ongoing strike lies with union leadership, not the hotels and certainly not the excited Taylor fans coming to Los Angeles. The union has stubbornly prolonged the dispute with demands that hotels support a Los Angeles ballot measure that would require them to house the homeless alongside paying guests./nWith a potential transformation of these hotels into makeshift homeless shelters, good luck getting tourists to stay there for Taylor’s next tour stop in Los Angeles./nFor related news, see: Eleni Kounalakis hypocritically calls for Taylor Swift to cancel shows after attending concert/nAlso on the list of demands is a new hotel tax of seven percent, which guests would pay into a trust fund controlled by the union. The union claims the money would go towards affordable housing, but the language of the fund gives it broad latitude to spend the money on “other efforts” as well./nAs of this writing, Swift seems poised to ignore the union’s unreasonable demands, picking the local economy and thousands of fans over the tantrums of Kurt Peterson and his cronies at Local 11. The tour dates will no doubt be a success, and should also serve as a lesson to other celebrities and politicians who face a Local 11 call for a boycott: There’s no harm in shaking off the unreasonable demands of Los Angeles labor unions./nMichael Saltsman is Executive Director at the Employment Policies Institute",-18.99651676,275,Tour,1

Her fans have spent thousands of dollars on concert tickets and shook the ground so hard at one concert that it registered as an earthquake on a seismometer near Seattle./nAt Beyoncé shows, fans dress up in attire inspired by cosmic cowboys and cowgirls, filling up stadiums in silver and glittery hats and boots. They follow her subtle cues, seas of people going silent as she sings the line “Look around everybody on mute,” from the 2022 song “Energy,” and have held up blue balloons to celebrate performances by her daughter Blue Ivy Carter. Billboard reported that her Renaissance World Tour had the biggest one-month gross in boxscore history in July./nReactions to the Swift job posting on Tuesday had been mixed, including praise for Gannett for trying to reach a new audience and criticism over how the company has laid off local journalists in recent years./nKristin Roberts, Gannett’s chief content officer, said in a statement on Tuesday night that the USA Today Network, which the company owns, is committed to serving its readers with essential journalism, and that “includes providing our audience with content they crave.”/n“As Taylor Swift’s fan base has grown to unprecedented heights, so has the influence of her music and growing legacy — not only on the industry but on our culture,” Ms. Roberts said. “She is shaping a generation and is relevant, influential and innovative — just like us.”/nNewspapers often employ music critics and entertainment reporters, but rarely assign a reporter to cover a single artist./nThe popularity of Swift, though, has proved to be a powerful force over the summer, culturally and economically./nA Federal Reserve survey of business contacts reported that Swift fans, or Swifties, had bolstered hotel revenues in the Philadelphia region. Although Swift, 33, and her promoters do not publicly report box-office figures, the trade publication Pollstar estimates that she has been selling about $14 million in tickets each night. By the end of her planned world tour, which is booked with 146 stadium dates well into 2024, Swift’s sales could reach $1.4 billion or more — exceeding Elton John’s $939 million for his multiyear farewell tour, the current record-holder./nSome journalists expressed concern about Gannett’s reporting priorities. Last December, Gannett cut about 6 percent of the company’s roughly 3,440-person U.S. media division. Media analysts said the move could worsen the state of the local news industry, which has shrunk in recent years, creating information deserts in communities across the country./nLaura D.

While the name in charge of the most competitive songs ranking in the U.S. won't change, it seems that the song that sits at No. 1 will./nAt the moment, it looks like Swift may replace herself atop the Hot 100 in just a few days. The singer currently controls Billboard's ranking of the most-consumed songs in America with her somewhat surprising smash ""Cruel Summer."" While there's a chance that the same tune could hold on for another frame atop the list, it seems more likely that the Grammy winner will swap one hit for another./nSwift is headed for another No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with 1989 (Taylor's Version), a slightly reworked version of her original blockbuster pop record. For the re-recording, she added several new tunes to the title, and it looks like one of them may debut atop the Hot 100./nOnce 1989 (Taylor's Version) arrived, fans flocked to hear the several new songs that were written during the initial 1989 sessions but never released. Almost immediately, ""Slut!"" stood out as the most popular track from the album, perhaps based off of its eye-catching title. While that tune will likely perform well, it no longer seems to be a frontrunner for the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100. Instead, a top 10 start is highly probable./nCurrently, fellow new tune—or ""From The Vault"" in Swift's speak—""Is It Over Now?"" is the presumptive ruler. The track has been selling well on iTunes since its release, but in the past day or so, it's been supplanted by a slew of Halloween hits./nThe track has been running the show on Spotify, however, and all those streams may make it an instant ruler. The cut spent four of its first five days at No. 1 on the streamer’s ranking of the top-streamed tunes in the U.S., which is a great sign it’s headed for a spectacular launch./nIt's very rare for an artist to replace themselves atop the Hot 100, and only a relatively small number of acts have done so. Swift is already included in that roundup, as she swapped one 1989 smash for another nearly a decade ago. Now, she's set to score another No. 1 from the title, many years later./n",-5.135166557,281,Achievements,1

The 33-year-old Swift is among the richest self-made women in America, worth some $740 million per Forbes’ latest calculations and making an estimated $92 million last year. Kelce, a seven-time All-Pro and two-time Super Bowl champion, netted a comparatively meager $3 million in marketing deals and $12 million in salary and bonuses, though experts say the boost in his celebrity due to his more famous other half could result in more lucrative partnerships./n20%. That’s the proportion of all Chiefs-Jets bets on FanDuel that were Kelce props, according to the company./nThe financial impact of the Kelce and Swift connection has extended far beyond gambling. The Bears-Chiefs game was the second-most-watched game of the NFL’s first three weeks thanks in no small part to the pop star’s presence, the resale market for Chiefs-Jets tickets exploded after reports surfaced about Swift’s planned attendance and Kelce jersey sales spiked 400%./n/n",6.529860199,283,Unrelated,0

I don’t know if you’re aware of this and when T.

It’s hard for me to wrap my head around that sentence, but, yeah.”/nJason: “Not only is social media noticing it, but it appears that Big Red [Chiefs coach Andy Reid] is noticing it, because he weighed in (big laugh from Travis), that’s right, in his postgame press conference ...”/nTravis: “Love Coach Reid, man, what a guy.”/nJason: “... he was asked about your big game, and his response was, ‘Kelce keeps getting better with time, Taylor can stay around all she wants.” (Big laughs from both)/n Sports /nChiefs’ Travis Kelce discussed the NFL’s over-the-top coverage of Taylor Swift on his podcast with brother Jason. The NFL defended it, calling it ‘a pop cultural moment.’/nOct. 5, 2023/nTravis: “What a guy. Listen, when you’re getting Big Red’s approval and blessings you know you’re doing something right.”/nJason: “That’s right.”/nTravis Kelce then quickly shifted the conversation to the game, the fans, next week’s game, divisional rivalry — and all pretty much in one breath. You’ll also notice that even during the discussion about the graphic, Kelce opted not to focus on the notion that Swift needs to be around for him to have a good game. /nAnd, obviously, it’s a ridiculous notion. Maybe CBS was just having a little fun and trying to troll the NFL fans who have been triggered by the suggestion that Swift put Kelce “on the map.” Sure, Swift was there the past two weeks when Kelce caught nine passes for 124 yards against the Denver Broncos and had 12 catches for 179 yards (his second-most ever) against the Chargers. But those were the 43rd and 44th times in the tight end’s 11-year career (regular season and playoffs combined) that he’s had 100 yards or more in a game./n Music /nTravis Kelce, who is dating Taylor Swift, has upgraded his humble Kansas City abode by reportedly buying a $6-million mansion in Kansas to get more privacy./nOct. 19, 2023/nIt should also be noted that Swift was in the VIP suite when Kelce had 69 receiving yards against Chicago and 60 against the New York Jets — not at all bad numbers, but well below the average CBS highlighted. Also, one of the games Swift did not attend was a 26-yard effort against Jacksonville in Week 2, Kelce’s first game of the year after missing the opener with a knee injury. That number brings Kelce’s average yardage for the two Taylor-less games way down. /nSo it seems very unlikely that Swift is a living, breathing good luck charm for a player who already was considered to be a future Hall of Famer.

				Gracie Abrams has been announced as the opening act for all of Taylor Swift's new US and Canada shows in the fall. Here's what you need to know about Gracie.			/n
5 Things
/n/nGracie Abrams is only 23 years old and she’s already gone on tour with two of the biggest superstars in music. Gracie was an opening act on Olivia Rodrigo‘s 2022 Sour Tour that ran from April 2022 to July 2022. Gracie told her fans that she was “screaming crying” in excitement when she found out the news from Olivia. Then in 2023, Gracie opened for over a dozen shows on the first US leg of Taylor Swift‘s Eras Tour./nTaylor announced on August 3, 2023 that her tour is returning to the U.S. and going to Canada in the fall with Gracie as the special guest performer. “IT DOESN’T HAVE TO BE OVER😭,” Gracie wrote on Instagram to celebrate the news. “@taylorswift I love you forever. I can’t even …… HAPPY ERAS,” she added. Gracie will perform at Taylor’s shows in Miami, New Orleans, Indianapolis, and Toronto in October 2023 and November 2023./n/nA post shared by Gracie Abrams (@gracieabrams)/n/nHollywoodLife has all the updates on Gracie Abrams below. Keep reading to learn all about the talented singer, including who her famous father is./nGracie Madigan Abrams, born Sept. 7, 1999, is an American singer-songwriter. She released her debut single, “Mean It,” in 2019 and followed it up with “Stay.” In 2020, she released her debut ep, Minor, which included songs, “Long Sleeves,” “Friend,” “I Miss You, I’m Sorry’ and more. She promoted the release with appearances on late-night shows and continued to work on her career during the pandemic months. She teamed with Benny Blanco for his Friends Keep Secrets 2 album, joining him on the single, “Unlearn.” In 2021, she also released Mess It Up,” “Feels Like,” and “Rockland,” a song she wrote with Aaron Dresser (the member of The National who co-wrote and produced Taylor Swift’s folklore and evermore.)./nGracie is the daughter of J.J. Abrams and Katie McGrath. JJ is best known for directing movies like Cloverfield, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the 2009 Star Trek reboot, and more. He also has created Alias, Lost, and Fringe and had his hand in several other projects. Katie is also a producer, as she’s worked with her and JJ’s Bad Robots Productions company, as well as the Katie McGrath & JJ Abrams Family Foundation./n“Even the slight knowledge that I had of it growing up as a kid made me want to have nothing to do with it at all,” Gracie said of her parents’ business in an interview with Riff Magazine. “When I started falling in love with music independent of all other factors in my life, it was kind of a happy surprise, just because I actively tried to avoid anything that they were involved in. I—with love—wanted nothing to do with them.”/nAt age 8, she signed up for drumming classes. She then learned piano, then guitar, finding them more conducive to her songwriting. Her protective parents only allowed her to post the music to her SoundCloud and required that she keep her Instagram private. When she made the account public, her career took off – and it led to some amazing connections. Lorde even DM’d Gracie, asking for a download of one of her songs./n“She definitely is an artist in my life that I will forever feel like I owe everything to,” Gracie told Riff when talking about Lorde. “Sonically and thematically, [Pure Heroine] changed my life. I remember being with my family in the living room, and I refresh my Instagram and see that she followed me. I had a crazy physical reaction, like, sweating immediately.”/n“One of my favorite artists and one of the coolest people ever is Gracie Abrams, who just came out with her debut EP a couple of months ago,” Olivia told Zane Lowe in January 2021 (per ET Canada). “It’s called Minor, and she’s absolutely amazing, love that entire record. She’s signed to my same record label, so they’re like, ‘Oh, we’ll have you meet.’ And I’m like, ‘I literally don’t think I can meet her. I think I would just evaporate. I’m her biggest fan.’ I’ve heard the best things, and I’ve been DMing her on Instagram, and I told her that ‘Driver’s License’ was so inspired by her, and she’s like, ‘Oh, that’s amazing.'”/n“This is my bedroom songwriting oasis,” Olivia Rodrigo said in a May 2021 interview with Elle. Olivia “created a little shrine” to all the “singer-songwriters she admires.” Among that makeshift ‘Hall of Fame’ were Taylor Swift, Gwen Stefani, Alanis Morissette, and, of course, Gracie Abrams.” Simon Riback, the head of A&R at Interscope – part of the company that includes Geffen Records, which is Olivia’s label – said he was impressed by Olivia and how she named Gracie as one of her favorite artists. “Gracie’s in her infancy! She started referencing Fiona Apple, the Smashing Pumpkins. She liked the Taylor Swifts and all that, but you could tell there was a left-of-center view to the way she was approaching pop music.”/nDuring the 2020 election, Gracie worked as a poll worker in her area, something she told NME was inspired by her friends. “Unfortunately, for a really long time, younger people had assumed we would be OK in the hand of the older generation, but clearly we can’t rely on them to shape the future that we want to see,” she told the publication. “Being involved really mattered to me.”",5.819501689,287,Unrelated,0

297,Ben Sisario,Taylor Swift’s ‘1989’ May Be Her Biggest Rerecording Yet. Here’s Why.,"The pop superstar’s new version of her 2014 blockbuster is due Friday, following a summer of media saturation and her 10th No. 1 hit.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/arts/music/taylor-swift-1989-taylors-version.html,The New York Times,entertainment,us,2023-10-25T17:41:01+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,297,"Advertisement/nSupported by/nThe pop superstar’s new version of her 2014 blockbuster is due Friday, following a summer of media saturation and her 10th No. 1 hit./nBy Ben Sisario/nTaylor Swift’s “1989” has been a fixture in the Top 20 of Billboard’s album chart for months. Stuffed with some of the singer’s biggest pop hits, like “Shake It Off” and “Blank Space,” the LP was a gargantuan hit when it was released in 2014, and this year Swift has been performing its songs on her record-breaking Eras Tour./nBut “1989” is about to make an all-but-certain plunge down the chart./nOpen this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS./nThat’s because on Friday, Swift will release “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” the latest installment in her ambitious and wildly successful project to rerecord her first six studio albums. What began a few years ago as an attempt to reclaim her music — and, perhaps, have a taste of revenge — after the sale of her former record label has become a blockbuster enterprise all its own, with punishing consequences for the original recordings./n“1989” will be the fourth of Swift’s remakes, and each one so far has opened at No. 1 with successively bigger numbers. In early 2021, “Fearless” started with the equivalent of 291,000 sales in the United States. “Red,” anchored by a smoldering, 10-minute extended version of the song “All Too Well,” had 605,000 later that year. “Speak Now” came out in July and started with 716,000 sales, including a remarkable 268,500 copies sold on vinyl LP./nEach one has arrived with deluxe packaging, a rainbow of colored vinyl variants and a thick appendix of “vault” bonus tracks that have given fans abundant material to discuss and decode — not to mention well-timed batches of themed merchandise. Among the items Swift is selling at her online store are a sweater decorated with sea gulls (à la the new album cover), for $74.89, and a device like an old-fashioned View-Master, for $19.89./nHow big “1989” could be is anyone’s guess, and her label, Republic Records, declined to offer any projections. But given the trajectory of the previous remakes, the enduring popularity of the songs on the original album and Swift’s near-total saturation of popular culture this year — in just the past few weeks, she released a hit concert film, reached No. 1 with a four-year-old song and has nearly upstaged the N.F.L. through her relationship with Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs — the music industry is bracing for a monster debut, even in a year that has had major albums by Morgan Wallen, Drake, Olivia Rodrigo and Travis Scott./nSwift has been stoking demand for “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” since announcing it in August, partnering with Google for an online puzzle to reveal clues about the album’s “vault” tracks; naturally, it crashed within hours./nWhen Swift first spoke about her intention to rerecord her albums, in summer 2019 — shortly after the music manager Scooter Braun bought Big Machine, Swift’s original label, for a bit over $300 million — the music world scratched its collective head; most previous attempts at rerecordings had had little success. But when the new version of “Fearless” came out — by which time Braun had sold Swift’s recording rights to the investment firm Shamrock Capital — it became another lesson in Swift’s mastery in rallying her fan base./n“When the rerecord process started with her, it was this curiosity, where no one really knew what it could do,” said Keith Caulfield, Billboard’s managing director of charts and data operations. “But they have turned into a phenomenon unto themselves.”/nSwift’s world tour, which has played to packed stadiums since March and is in line to sell well over $1 billion in tickets by the time it ends next year, has generally lifted her entire catalog. At various times this year, at least 10 of her albums, including the originals, have been in the Billboard 200, the magazine’s flagship albums chart./nBut each time Swift has released a rerecorded album, its corresponding original version has suffered. In the year after she released “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” sales of the original fell 20 percent in the United States, according to Luminate, the tracking service that supplies the data for Billboard’s charts; the original “Red” dropped by about 45 percent. Neither has been on the Billboard 200 since 2021./nJaime Marconette, Luminate’s senior director of music insights and industry relations, noted how stark that impact can be on a week-to-week basis. In May, Swift said she would release a new “Speak Now” in eight weeks. “That announcement,” Marconette said, “immediately drove a 75.7 percent increase in total consumption for the original version.” But as soon as “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” came out, the original sank. Comparing a window of 14 weeks before and after the new version, the original fell 59 percent./nOn the latest chart, the new “Speak Now” is No. 18. The old version, which was most recently No. 191, had fallen off the chart entirely./nStatistics like that call into question the value of Shamrock’s investment, which has been estimated at more than $300 million. In the short term, at least, there is no doubt that Swift’s rerecordings have severely dimmed the originals. But it may take years before it is clear whether there is a lasting impact. A spokeswoman for Shamrock said that no one at the firm was available to discuss the matter./nSwift also stands to earn more money from her new recordings than her old ones, thanks to a deal she negotiated with Universal Music, Republic’s parent company, that gave her ownership rights to her recordings./nAs Swift’s new “1989” nears release, the singer has been promoting it steadily on social media, this week sharing an image of handwritten lyrics that fans have interpreted as being from an unreleased track. And truckloads of vinyl and CD copies of the new album have been making their way to brick-and-mortar stores./nEven indie record shops are primed to do huge business with the new “1989,” as they have with all of Swift’s recent releases. Carl Mello of Newbury Comics, a music and collectibles chain that has 30 stores throughout the Northeast, said that for some of Swift’s previous albums, problems in the supply chain have meant that stores did not always have her records on release day. But those issues have been resolved, and the chain expects to have about 1,600 copies ready for sale on Friday./n“I’ve been at Newbury Comics for just over 30 years, and I’ve never seen somebody who has occupied so many spots in our Top 40 vinyl records list at the same time, consistently for months and months,” Mello said./n“It wouldn’t surprise me if Taylor Swift is 15 percent of our vinyl sales,” he added. “It’s extraordinary.”/nAudio produced by Tally Abecassis./nBen Sisario covers the music industry.

The supermodel, who attended the show with two friends, trended on X, formerly known as Twitter, after fellow concertgoers spotted her in the audience./nWhile the tour has seen some of Hollywood's biggest stars including Courteney Cox, Gigi Hadid, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively attend the show in the VIP section, fans were bemused to see that Karlie wasn't in the VIP area, but instead appeared to have standard tickets to the show./nTaking to Twitter, one person wrote: ""I was wondering why Karlie Kloss didn't have a public birthday party when she usually does them on this day and guys... this is her party. She's celebrating her birthday at the eras tour,"" while another person added: ""Karlie Kloss had the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever and she did. Good for her.""/nA third person added: ""You know after I've seen so many different vile comments Swifites have made about Karlie i never would've really expected her to attend it but she's so brave, like i genuinely admire that woman like imagine having that many people hating you omg Karlie Kloss i love you.""/nSo what happened between Taylor and Karlie? After the pair were very close from 2013, by 2017 it appeared that their friendship had cooled off, with Karlie's name being conspicuously left out Taylor's T-shirt for Look What You Made Me Do, which included several of her famous friends named including Selena Gomez, Lena Dunham and Ed Sheeran. Taylor also didn't attend Karlie's weddings in 2018 and 2019./nThe intrigue about their fall out even interested the celebrity world, with Jennifer Lawrence previously discussing it with the New York Times, saying: ""I’d like to know what’s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift, that’s the honest to God truth. Is nobody else curious? It’s keeping me up at night. What happened?""/nWhile Taylor has remained tight-lipped about the situation, Karlie has claimed that she and Taylor are still friends, telling New York Times: ""Don't believe everything you read."" When asked about Jennifer's comments about their friendship, she later told Vogue: ""Jen, don’t worry — Taylor and I are still really good friends.""/nWhile there is no explanation about Karlie and Taylor's supposed fall out, fans have speculated that it could be related to Scooter Braun, who is Karlie's manager, and famously purchased Taylor's masters without her permission, leading her to re-record the music.",3.767340883,298,Gossip,0
299,Fiona Creadon,Opinion: Stop Mobbing Taylor Swift,"With the rise of Taylor Swift's fame over the course of the Eras Tour, fans have felt emboldened to show up at places she frequents. Perspectives Assistant Editor Fiona Creadon shares why this is problematic and should be discouraged.The post Opinion: Stop Mobbing Taylor Swift appeared first on Pepperdine Graphic.",https://pepperdine-graphic.com/opinion-stop-mobbing-taylor-swift/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=opinion-stop-mobbing-taylor-swift,pepperdine-graphic,general,us,2023-11-08T03:38:04+00:00,FALSE,TRUE,299,"November 7, 2023 by Fiona Creadon /nTransparency Item: The Perspectives section of the Graphic is comprised of articles based on opinion. This is the opinion and perspective of the writer./nBeing a fan of Taylor Swift is trendy again./nAny long-time Swiftie will tell you that, not all that long ago, a significant portion of the internet was trying to cancel Taylor Swift, largely due to an edited video of her seemingly consenting to a lyric about her in the Kanye West song ‘Famous,’ according to The Hollywood Reporter./nWest and Swift’s feud snowballed into a giant hate campaign against Swift that led her to retreat from the public eye, and the theme of her sixth studio album, Reputation, was born, according to Vogue./nReputation dropped Nov. 10, 2017, and was an instant success — selling 2 million copies worldwide in the first week of its release. Following the release of the album, Swift went on the Reputation Stadium tour, which ended in Japan on Nov. 21, 2018, Swift began secretly filming for her documentary — Miss Americana — which premiered Jan. 23, 2020./nSwift had two powerful sources that helped change the perception of her and bring back the previous adoration the public had prior to the ‘Famous’ debacle. The Reputation Tour was the largest tour she had done at that point, and the documentary was critically successful and widely viewed./nThis leads us to the present day, in which Swift is on a break from the Eras Tour, which is her largest tour to date — spanning five continents. This newfound spotlight, which is likely the largest it has ever been for Swift, is exciting but not without its challenges./nIt has sparked disturbing habits from fans and the public toward Swift./nWith the way social media works, it is easy to spread news almost instantly. People use Instagram and X — formerly known as Twitter — to announce sightings of celebrities like Taylor Swift./nThese posts can be shared quickly, and all of a sudden, hundreds of people are standing outside of Swift’s recording studio, home or, most egregiously, the rehearsal dinner for the wedding of her longtime friend Jack Antonoff./nSwift is no stranger to this behavior and not-so-subtly expressed her disapproval in her documentary, saying in reference to fans gathering outside her house, “This is my front yard, and I’m highly aware of the fact that [fans waiting outside her house] is not normal,” Swift said in Miss Americana./nOne of the few times Swift has ever potentially alluded to her frustration toward people harassing her in public comes in the form of lyrics from the song “The Lakes,” which was the bonus track on Folklore, Swift’s eighth studio album. In the song, she writes, “I’m not cut out for all these cynical clones/ These hunters with cell phones.”/nWhile Swift has yet to make a public statement condemning the injudicious behavior and how it has escalated over the course of her Eras Tour, this feels like a particularly sensitive issue for Swift, who has been the victim of several stalkers and death threats./nI believe the reason Swift has yet to make a public statement about this tactless habit from some of her fans is due to the fact that her music has always been very personal, and this can create an exaggerated sense of closeness between her and her fans./nMany fans think they know about all the inner workings of Swift’s life and thus have a right to see her, connect with her, etc., according to a BuzzFeed article. This, in its essence, is the definition of a parasocial relationship./nIt is undeniable that Swift has always cared deeply about her fans. She has sent fans Christmas gifts, made donations to fans during the pandemic and even hosted secret sessions for her albums “1989,” “Reputation” and “Lover.”  /nThese are gatherings she hosted at her houses to give fans an opportunity to meet her, listen to her albums prior to their releases and take photos with her./nHowever, as a society, it is important to firmly draw a distinction between being a fan and being a stalker. Recently, it seems that line has blurred./nIt is not acceptable to show up at a place where you believe someone might be, celebrity or not. If this was done to a private citizen, it would be considered stalking./nBecause Swift is a public figure, all sense of decorum has gone out the window. Not only is the constant pursuit of Swift’s whereabouts highly inappropriate, but it can become very dangerous for both Swift and her fans./nThis is because a large crowd of people or cars chasing after someone is not conducive to a normal public environment and creates chaos. We do not have to look far back in history to see when fans and paparazzi chasing stars had fatal consequences./nI am a fan of Swift, so I completely understand the love and connection that people can feel for an artist. However, the kindest thing we can do as fans is respect those artists’ privacy./nThere is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to take a moment to stop a celebrity to say hello or express your appreciation for their work. However, Swift is of a level of fame that anywhere she goes, she is likely to encounter dozens, if not hundreds, of fans./nSwift can no longer be easily accessed, and we have to accept that as fans. Let’s give her the gift of going to a restaurant, a friend’s party, her place of work or even her home without feeling like she is being hunted down./nTaylor Swift has always made an effort to make her fans feel seen and appreciated. Let’s pay her back by respecting her privacy./n_______________________/nFollow the Graphic on Twitter: @PeppGraphic/nContact Fiona Creadon via Instagram (@Fiocreao) or by email: fiona.creadon@pepperdine.edu/nFiled Under: Perspectives Tagged With: fandom, fans, Fiona Creadon, perspectives, problematic, reputation, Swiftie, Taylor Swift., the Graphic, trends",6.537845065,299,Social impact,1

News, adding that the “Blank Space” singer  said she would extend the gesture “every time I release something.” /nThe reason goes back to a tweet from four years ago. /nIn July 2019, Clarkson heard that Scooter Braun had purchased the Big Machine Records label and was refusing to sell Swift the rights to her first six albums’ masters, she told Andy Cohen on his Sirius XM radio show this past summer. “It felt wrong that [Swift] didn’t have the opportunity” to own her songs when she was willing to buy them, Clarkson said./n Movies /nTaylor Swift took to Tumblr on Sunday to express her frustration over news that her master recordings had been acquired by music manager Scooter Braun. /nJune 30, 2019/nThat was when the “Stronger” singer tweeted out the billion-dollar idea: Swift should rerecord her songs./n“It wasn’t anything against [Braun],” Clarkson said, although he seemed to take offense and called her manager about the tweet. “I knew it was important to her, so I thought, ‘Why don’t you just rerecord them and your fans will support you.’”/n Music /nScooter Braun acquired Taylor Swift’s former label, Big Machine, and her master recordings in 2019.

News about Swift’s character and intelligence./n“I love how kind she is. She’s a very smart businesswoman,” said Clarkson. “It just sucks when you see artists that you admire and you respect really wanting something and it’s special to them. You know, if they’re going to find a loophole, you find a loophole. And she did.”/n Movies /nA juggernaut opening weekend — historic for a concert film — will be a much-needed shot in the arm for an industry hobbled by strikes./nOct. 15, 2023/nThat loophole has  paid off big-time for one of the bestselling music artists of all time./nIn October, “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” became Swift’s 13th No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. (and more than 3.5 million units worldwide) in the first week of release alone — garnering Swift the biggest album debut of her career./n“It’s so cool to see a fan base really get behind her,” Clarkson told E! News. “She’s really known for being such an incredible songwriter and the soundtrack to a lot of people’s lives, and that’s her life, so like, you should have the option of owning that.”/nOnly two albums are yet to be rereleased: her debut, “Taylor Swift,” which  came out in 2006, and 2017’s “Reputation.”/n Company Town /n “Taylor’s Version” of the singer-songwriter’s 2014 album is the most-streamed album of the year one day after its release./nOct. 29, 2023/nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

The re-recorded take on her pop blockbuster 1989 is expected on October 27, and that means it’s time to hype up the world for the title…as if people weren’t already excited. But while it might seem like Swift has only just recently started promoting the forthcoming chart-topper, she’s actually been doing so for years now./nShe may have only announced it formally in early August, but Swift has actually been getting the public ready for 1989 (Taylor’s Version) for quite some time, as it’s expected to be massive. The singer released the first taste of the album more than two years ago. In September 2021, Swift dropped ""Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)"" without warning, thrilling her legion of listeners./n""Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version),” the re-recorded take of her 1989 single “Wildest Dreams,” quickly became another top 40 hit for Swift, as it debuted and peaked at No. 37 on the Hot 100. Fans immediately expected an announcement that 1989 (Taylor’s Version) was on its way, but that didn’t turn out to be the case./nMore than half a year later, Swift once again gave her dedicated followers reason to believe that 1989 (Taylor’s Version) was on its way. In May 2022, she released “This Love (Taylor’s Version)” after it was teased in the trailer for the Amazon

 series The Summer I Turned Pretty. The reworking of 1989 track “This Love” was also a Hot 100 success, peaking at No. 50. But again, the CD didn’t come./nEarlier this week, The singer-songwriter crashed Google when she teamed up with the tech giant to create online word puzzles her fans could solve as a way to reveal the “From The Vault” tunes set to be premiered on the new album. She announced that game via an animated video she posted to Instagram, and the topic quickly went viral./nBy doing so, Swift officially began promoting 1989 (Taylor’s Version), or so it may seem. Swift has actually been getting the world ready for the title for years, and all that work and planning will surely pay off when it opens atop the Billboard 200, likely with the largest starting sum of any of her re-releases./n",3.204573824,301,Discography,0

Would this topical sketch show in any way address the Israel-Hamas war? Should it? As it has in previous times of crisis, “S.N.L.” met the moment by taking things seriously, and in this case found an unexpectedly poignant spokesman in this week’s host, Pete Davidson./nDavidson, an “S.N.L.” alumnus, began the show by speaking directly to the audience, reminding them that his father, a firefighter, had been killed in the 9/11 attacks. “This week,” Davidson said, “we saw the horrible images and stories from Israel and Gaza. And I know what you’re thinking: Who better to comment on it than Pete Davidson?”/nHe continued:/nWell, in a lot of ways, I am a good person to talk about it because when I was 7 years old, my dad was killed in a terrorist attack, so I know something about what that’s like. I saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering, Israeli children and Palestinian children. And it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place. No one in this world deserves to suffer like that, especially not kids./nDavidson shared a story about how, in the months that followed, his mother had sought to cheer him up by giving him what she thought was a Disney movie — but turned out to be the Eddie Murphy stand-up special “Delirious.” Though it may not have been ideal material for an 8-year-old, it did make Davidson laugh./n“Sometimes comedy is really the only way forward through tragedy,” Davidson said. “My heart is with everyone whose lives have been destroyed this week. But tonight, I’m going to do what I’ve always done in the face of tragedy, and that’s try to be funny. Remember, I said ‘Try.’”/nDavidson’s monologue was an abbreviated stand-up set, delivered in his more traditional manner — no topical material but lots of ribald jokes we can’t safely transcribe here, so caveat emptor./nAmong the subjects that we can (just about) get away with mentioning, Davidson discussed an ill-fated attempt to bond with his sister by watching the fantasy series “Game of Thrones,” which neither of them had seen. “I thought it was like dragons and stuff, and magic,” Davidson said. “Hardly any dragons. Lots of incest. Tons of incest. So much incest. You could leave the house, come back, incest still happening.”/nHe also joked about his Staten Island roots and how it was not necessarily his childhood dream to become a comedian. “My dream was to be a construction worker,” he said. “It was. Hopefully work for a construction company for like eight years, and then if I’m lucky, fall off a ladder. Sue the city for six mil, settle for three. Marry some chick I had a crush on in high school. That I’m not even really into anymore — but no one else can have her!”/nThough she wasn’t announced ahead of time as a participant in this week’s show, Taylor Swift — who, you may have heard, has a new movie out this weekend — was not only a surprise guest on “S.N.L.” but the running theme of this week’s broadcast: A sketch that lampooned Fox’s NFL coverage leaned heavily on jokes about the pop star’s burgeoning relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and concluded with a cameo from the football player./nSwift was also referenced in a filmed segment from Please Don’t Destroy and in a Weekend Update desk segment that cast Bowen Yang as Christopher Columbus. For good measure, Swift herself showed up to introduce a second performance from this week’s musical guest, Ice Spice. Mikey Day showed off his friendship bracelets during “S.N.L.” good-nights, but Swift herself wasn’t seen there. She has an empire to run, after all./nThis being an “S.N.L.” episode centered on Davidson means that you’re going to get a lot of sketches about the fact that Davidson is, well, Davidson and lives the life that Davidson lives. That said, he and “S.N.L.” availed themselves pretty well with this segment that both parodies and faithfully recreates a musical lamentation performed by Ryan Gosling in this summer’s hit comedy “Barbie.”/nThe many, many references to Davidson’s real-life exploits are too numerous to catalog here, but we would like to acknowledge this verse in particular:/nI’m just Pete.Anyone else, I’d be a threeBut I guess I’m hot for dudes in comedy’cause it’s an ugly industry./nOver at the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff on the Israel-Hamas War and Laphonza Butler’s appointment to the Senate seat formerly held by Dianne Feinstein./nJost began:/nWell, this was a terrible week for the world but a great week for random idiots who like to share completely unhinged thoughts wherever they can. And weirdly it’s not even on social media anymore. I saw a 1,000-word essay called “How I’d Fix Palestine,” and it was posted in a Yelp review of a Buffalo Wild Wings./nEven world leaders who could be making it better are making it worse. For example, former President Trump went out of his way to praise the terrorist group Hezbollah, calling them “very smart."" Though in Trump’s defense he thinks Hezbollah is the genie from Aladdin./nChe continued:/nLaphonza Butler was sworn in as California’s newest senator, becoming the first openly [gay] Black woman in Congress. “Um, you mean second,” said George Santos./nDave Itzkoff is a culture reporter whose latest book, “Robin,” a biography of Robin Williams, was published in May 2018.

/n/nShe’s in her NFL era! Taylor Swift was spotted supporting Travis Kelce at the Chiefs game for the second week in a row. This time, the “Lover” singer, 33, showed up for the tight end, 33, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Sunday, October 1, while he played against the New York Jets./nTaylor, who rocked a black top and bedazzled jeans, attended the game with her celebrity BFFs Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, as pictured in this post from a popular Taylor Swift fan account. She was also videoed hugging her friend and fellow pop star Sabrina Carpenter./n/nA post shared by Autumn Kennedy (@tstourtips)/n/nTaylor’s appearance at MetLife marks the second time in a row that she’s shown up to a Chiefs game. Last week, on Sunday, September 24, the “Enchanted” artist broke the internet after fans realized that she was sitting alongside Travis’ mom, Donna Kelce, in the Travis Kelce Suite at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri./nWithin minutes, photos and videos of Taylor went completely viral. Since then, Swifites and football fans alike can’t get enough of the blossoming romance between the pop star and the two-time Super Bowl champion./nThe Taylor and Travis saga began back in July after the “New Heights” podcast host shared a story about trying to give the songwriter his phone number. “Well, I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” Travis recalled to his brother, Jason Kelce, after attending night 2 of the Eras Tour in Kansas City./n“So, I was little butthurt that I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her. If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there,” Travis continued. “But I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it. … She doesn’t meet anybody, or at least, she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal.”/nSince then, it’s clear that something is happening between the beloved pair. In fact, following the Chiefs game last week against the Chicago Bears, Taylor and Travis drove off in the athlete’s convertible (a.k.a. their getaway car) and attended an afterparty with the rest of the team./nWhile celebrating at Prime Social in Kansas City, Taylor sweetly wrapped her arms around Travis’ neck, as per a photo obtained by TMZ./nMoreover, during a September 27 episode of “New Heights,” Travis gushed over Taylor. “Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up. That was pretty ballsy,” he joked with Jason. “I just thought it was awesome how everyone in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. The friends and family. She looked amazing, everybody was talking about her in a great light. On top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course. We script it all ladies and gentlemen. It was just impressive.”/nPrior to Travis, Taylor’s most notable relationship was with her now-ex-boyfriend of six years, Joe Alwyn. The pair called it quits in April 2023. As for Travis, his last relationship was with Kayla Nicole from 2017 to 2022./n

/n/nTaylor Swift, 33, and Blake Lively, 36, spent a fun night out in New York City, NY on Saturday. The singer and actress, who have been friends for years, were photographed wearing fashionable outfits as they walked beside each other outside of Zero Bond restaurant, where they enjoyed dinner together. They both flashed smiles and appeared to have a great time during the outing./nTaylor wore a black button-up sweater with a V-neck and a dark gray skirt. She also added dark brown heeled knee-length boots to her look, and carried a brown purse over one shoulder. Blake wore an opened denim long-sleeved shirt over a white top with multi-colored designs all over it, and a read patterned twill skirt. She also added multi-colored heels and carried a blue purse./nBefore Taylor and Blake’s latest outing, the former wowed at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards, where she took home nine awards, last week. She wore a black sleeveless dress with buttons and a slit and had her hair up with some loose strands hanging down. She also accessorized with various pieces of jewelry, including multiple necklaces and rings./nBlake also made a recent public appearance at a fashion show during New York Fashion Week earlier this month. She looked incredible in a sparkly gold sleeveless jumpsuit with a belt around her waist. She also accessorized with earrings and had her long curly hair down as she posed for photos./nTaylor and Blake have both been enjoying impressive and successful careers throughout their years-long friendship. The two pals first connected in 2015, when Blake shared a photo from a L’Oréal campaign that mentioned Taylor’s “Bad Blood” music video in the caption./n“Soooo, turns out this WASN’T a video shoot for John Legend’s cover of Bad Blood,” Blake’s caption read. “@lorealparisofficial blew it out for this one. My #pinkobsession is exposed now. Ok your turn. I won’t tell! #AlsoTurnsOutJohnLegendIsntCoveringBadBlood Time to start a petition!”/nSince then, the gorgeous gals have been seen hanging out numerous times and have gushed over each other at various times. Taylor also used Blake and her husband Ryan Reynolds‘ children’s names, including James, Inez, and Betty, in her song “Betty,” off her Folklore album. Since then, the lovebirds have welcomed a fourth child earlier this year.",-2.996799205,309,Gossip,1

/n/nI’ve witnessed my longtime friend Lori Totten, of Brea, and her soon-to-be 19-year-old daughter Tiffany go to extraordinary lengths to join the millions of fans that scored tickets to see Swift out on her The Eras Tour. I was with Lori on a trip to Boston in 2019, sitting at an Italian restaurant and waiting for our dinner, when she manically tried to purchase tickets on her phone to Swift’s Lover Fest, the ill-fated 2020 outing in support of Swift’s seventh studio album, “Lover.” That would have played off as the first big concert at the all-new SoFi Stadium that year had it not been for the COVID-19 pandemic./nI just also happened to be with her and two of our girlfriends on a trip to Big Bear when Swift dropped her latest album, “Midnights,” last year. We stayed up to listen to the album through and through in our cozy cabin as the clock struck midnight./nWhen The Eras Tour went on sale last year and the overwhelming amount of fans crashed the Ticketmaster website, Lori and her longtime friend Andrea Ramos of Yorba Linda were both frantically attempting to score tickets to any and every show. By some divine stroke of luck — and hours and hours with no bathroom breaks — Ramos was able to pick up tickets for the Totten ladies, herself, and her 18-year-old daughter Emma, to Swift’s concert on May 5 in Nashville, Tennessee. After more stress and haggling, the two now-very-savvy ticket-buying women were finally able to secure tickets to a show closer to home and bought passes to see Swift at SoFi Stadium on the first night of the tour on Thursday, Aug. 3, too. The Totten’s are also going to the shows on Aug. 7-9 and Ramos women are headed to Aug. 7 and 9, too./nSo why all of the trouble and headaches just to see this one artist on tour?/nI joined Lori, Andrea, Tiffany and Emma on their ride to see Swift in Inglewood on Aug. 3 to find out that it wasn’t just about the music, there was much more to it./n“I just love what a phenomenal role model Taylor is for my kid,” Andrea said as we cruised down the 91 Freeway on the way to the show. “When ‘Reputation’ came out, Emma started having a stronger voice. It’s like ‘Reputation’ released Emma. Not to mention Taylor is just kind, generous and a great businesswoman.”/nEmma and Tiffany have known each other since about the age of three and grew up dancing competitively — even one year dressing up as Swifties with blonde bob wigs and dancing to Swift’s music./n“Aw, we are each other’s longest friend,” Emma realizes as the two, who are cozied in the back of the vehicle adjusting their “Folklore” and “Midnights” themed outfits and pondering aloud which secret songs Swift will play later that evening. (Spoiler alert: It was “Maroon” and “I Can See You (Taylor’s Version)”.)/n“I have a bracelet that says ‘I heart Mama Swift’ and I just think Taylor’s mom has to be such a great person to have raised such a great daughter,” Andrea said, referring to Swift’s mother, also named Andrea, who has become a rock star herself at her daughter’s shows, as she walks the venues to meet fans./n“I mean, the two of us are raising daughters, too, and it’s not easy,” she added./nI asked the young women why they liked Swift’s music and was met with a loud “Pffttt” and a laugh from Emma, the kind of response only a teenager could deliver without uttering, “Duh! My mom’s friend” at me./n“There are too many things, I can’t even name,” Tiffany offered./nAnd I very much believe she feels that way./nFor their mothers, it has become something special that they can share with their daughters./n“It’s something that Tiffany and I can bond over,” Lori said. “She has her music and I have mine, but this is our music. I also love that Taylor is so great with her fans and the music just makes me feel good.”/nFor Andrea, this is her final summer at home with Emma for now, who is heading to Indiana State University next year. As luck would have it, the day we were headed to Inglewood, Swift announced additional dates for The Eras Tour in 2024. And she’s hitting Indianapolis, not far from Emma’s new college, in November./n“We’re going to try to get tickets,” Andrea assures. “I just like that I have this time with Emma. I get to experience this with her.”/nLori is the first to admit she’s gone a little overboard this year with The Eras Tour, especially with her outfits. Since she’s going to four shows in Inglewood, she has a different outfit for each evening, all inspired by Swift’s costuming in her music videos or on previous tours. She did give my friends and me a fashion show the week before of each outfit, stuff she purchased off of Poshmark and Etsy and went to work bedazzling and glittering herself to make the looks just right. She did this for herself as well as for Tiffany and she laugh-cringes when she shares the outfits for four Southern California dates and the early stop in Nashville cost over a grand. She and Tiffany also made dozens of Swiftie friendship bracelets, each one with a Swift saying and song titles or lyrics, dates and more that meant something to them./nAnd because they’re both cat ladies, just like Swift, Lori made tiny little friendship bracelets for cats to give fellow cat-loving Swifties./n“It’s crazy how much those little beads cost,” she said with a laugh./nSome may think it’s insane to indulge so much in a silly little concert, but as these women put the final touches on their outfits and drew on glittery 13s on the backs of their hands (Swift’s favorite number), I watched them laugh, smile, hug and at time squeal in delight as they met other Swifties on the way up to the Stadium./nIt was almost like a scene from the new “Barbie” movie — instead of the normal “Hi, Barbie!” greeting inside Barbieland, it was “Hi, Swiftie” in Taylorland. They took pictures, traded bracelets with other fans and danced to the Swift songs that were being played outside the venue in anticipation for the big event./nThey scream-cried-sang and danced through the entire show and took lots of pictures and videos to post on social media. And, of course, they picked up more merch./n“It’s totally worth it,” Lori said of their Eras Tour experience.",0,310,Social impact,1

By then, she’s already researched the projected set time, along with the exact minute Swift is expected to play her much-anticipated surprise songs that are unique to each concert./nBut as the onstage countdown clock approaches zero, signaling Swift’s entrance, Bohne, 32, isn’t cheering from a stadium. Instead, at home in Salt Lake City, she fires up her husband’s laptop, searches for feeds from fans holding up their phones in the crowd and begins to broadcast a livestream of Swift’s three-hour-plus set on TikTok to her 160,000 (and counting) followers./nNight after night, thousands of Swifties are gathering to watch the superstar perform their favorite songs through their 5-inch phone screens. For some with tickets to future shows, it’s a chance to preview the  set list and better prepare for the big day. For others who enjoyed an earlier stop of the tour, it’s a way to relive cherished memories and keep in touch with the community./nAnd for fans who can’t afford the lofty ticket prices or live too far from a destination city, these unauthorized TikTok livestreams are the only way to get a glimpse of her billion-dollar-grossing, Ticketmaster-crashing tour./nBohne, the unofficial “Eras tour cruise director,” has become a one-stop shop for fans looking to watch from home. /n Music /nCultural dominance. History-making album sales. Sold-out stadiums. Add them up, and Taylor Swift’s current moment has little precedent in pop-music history./nAug. 1, 2023/nAfter attending the second show of the tour in Glendale, Ariz., Bohne watched livestreams on TikTok night after night, looking to recapture the magic of seeing Swift in the flesh. Often, the experience paled in comparison to the real thing — choppy feeds would cut in and out or drop entirely, or an overly eager fan’s earnest singing would drown out the notes from the stage. But instead of giving up, Bohne resolved to curate and improve the livestream viewing experience./nShe first went live on TikTok when the tour stopped in Atlanta at the end of April. At one point, her control center included multiple iPads, allowing her to track down alternate streams and switch back and forth when videos cut off midset./n“We called it the iPad Shuffle,” Bohne said. “In the beginning it was just a place where people could see where to find these streams. It wasn’t a great concert experience. But then it turned into a seamless watching experience.”/nThese days, Bohne goes live from her husband’s work computer while using an iPhone and iPad to scour TikTok, as well as sites like swiftstream.gay and various Twitch accounts, for backup streams. As her reach has grown, a number of brands have reached out seeking collaboration opportunities; she’s typically more excited to hear directly from Swift fans expressing their gratitude for her work./n“I had two different people message me and say they had panic attacks during the shows, and sitting down to watch the stream has been healing for them,” Bohne said. “Others had really bad anxiety trying to track down these streams, and I’ve been able to alleviate that for them. It makes me feel like I’m doing something worthwhile.”/n Entertainment & Arts /nParking! Public transit! Fan chants! Friendship bracelets! Everything you need to know before you see Taylor Swift at SoFi Stadium for the L.A. stops of her Eras tour./nAug. 4, 2023/nAn essential part of the ersatz Eras-watching experience is Swiftball, a Taylor-fied fantasy football game started by Twitter user @reckedmaserati, in which fans attempt to predict outfits, surprise songs and other goings-on. Winners have received prizes ranging from Swift CDs to merchandise to handcrafted art, all of which are donated by other Swiftball players. /nThe most recent Swiftball on July 29 received more than 11,000 submissions on Twitter, and on a typical TikTok stream, you’ll find a jumble of fans erupting with digital cheers or boos each time an answer is revealed./n“TikTok is the pinnacle of this,” said Russ Crupnick, managing partner at marketing research and industry analysis company MusicWatch and a professor at New York University. “It helps to magnify everything that’s going on around a tour. In the old days, if you didn’t have a ticket, you didn’t get to participate. Now you can.”/nAt the outset of the tour, it was harder to avoid the Swift livestreams on TikTok than it was to find them. In its quest to push the most engaging live videos to its For You page, TikTok’s algorithm boosted bootleg streams of the concert nearly every night, as Swifties locked in for hours and commented away./nEventually, TikTok removed streamers while they were live and suppressed them from the For You page./n“I feel like it’s become a lot harder to find streams,” Bohne said. “I got suspended once by TikTok, about two weeks ago, for intellectual property. That’s what’s been a little bit frustrating. I can have permission from someone who’s at the show to [use their stream], but if they’re not supposed to be streaming, I don’t know.”/nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, created in 1998, protects platforms from being held liable for content that infringes on copyrighted material, as long as the platform has a mechanism for rights holders to report and take down the offending content. During the internet’s early years, it was easier for copyright holders to locate and remove such items. Now, the proliferation of content has made that game of whack-a-mole virtually impossible./n“There are dozens if not hundreds of these videos popping up,” said Tatiana Cirisano, senior music analyst at Midia Research. “There’s a sentiment that this law was built before social media really existed, and it was meant to allow for creativity, and allow platforms to host things other people had made, without worrying about liability. But this was before there was so much content posted all the time, so now, it doesn’t really work.”/nRepresentatives for Swift and TikTok did not return a request for comment. /n Entertainment & Arts /nNot a lover of $100 parking spaces? There are plenty of ways to get to Taylor Swift’s concerts at SoFi Stadium by train or bus./nJuly 31, 2023/nSince the pandemic shuttered live music in 2020, authorized concert livestreams have grown in popularity. Just about every major festival streams the majority of its sets on platforms such as YouTube or Twitch, and according to a report from Midia Research, the amount of people watching shows from home nearly doubled in the past two years, from 9.3% at the end of 2020 to 17.7% at the end of 2022./nFans who consume the raw, user-generated streams on TikTok typically skew younger than YouTube audiences drawn to professional-quality recordings, but Cirisano believes that livestreams, whether authorized or bootleg, won’t cannibalize ticket sales. /n“There’s obviously overlap between [ticket-buying and livestreaming audiences],” Cirisano said. “But there’s nothing that can replace the in-person concert.”/nCrupnick argues that labels and music publishers shouldn’t prioritize filing copyright strikes against fans who are providing free promotion for their favorite acts. Instead, he says, the growth of user-generated livestreaming could become another negotiating chip in the copyright owners’ fight to extract more money from the social platform./n“At some point, they could take it all down, but fans will put it back up just as fast,” Crupnick said. “I think what the labels really want is fair compensation from TikTok.”/nFor Bohne, the TikTok livestreams are another way to feel connected to Swift./n“If I could talk to Taylor, my message to her would just be a giant thank you,” Bohne said. “She’s given us a community where we can find people who understand one another.”/nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

[+] Hugh Jackman cheer prior to the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium on October 01, 2023 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)/nThe NFL is, by a wide margin, the most popular sport in the United States. Despite its marketing and ratings prowess, the league continues its efforts of expanding its fanbase. This includes reaching out to Latinos (where fútbol is another sport) and expanding globally (this season the NFL will be playing five games in England and Germany.)/nAlso, having Amazon Prime Video stream Thursday Night Football games attracts a younger more digital savvy audience. Perhaps, another marketing strategy should be having singer-songwriting superstar Taylor Swift in attendance at more games. Swift was seen at the last two Kansas City Chiefs games, amplifying viewer interest into a social event with her legion of fans known as “Swifties”./nThere had been rumors swirling that Taylor Swift had been seeing Kansas City Chiefs eight-time all-pro tight end Travis Kelce. The widespread speculation was confirmed on September 24, when the 12-time Grammy Award winner was seen at Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium alongside Kelce’s mother. Throughout the game, Fox, which televised the contest, repeatedly showed Swift cheering in a luxury suite. Taylor Swift’s appearance came during a break of her blockbuster concert tour called the Eras Tour. During the tour, Swift had performed at Arrowhead Stadium on July 7-8./nThe late Sunday afternoon game, branded as “America’s Game of the Week”, reported the game had averaged 24.3 million viewers, the most watched television program of the week. Despite the strong audience, the viewing was off by 8% compared to the corresponding game last season (a marquee matchup between quarterbacks Tom Brady of Tampa Bay and Aaron Rodgers of Green Bay). Last season, “America’s Game of the Week” averaged 24.1 million viewers, making it the most watched TV program for the 14th straight year./nOne reason for the ratings falloff was the game was lopsided, with Kansas City leading the Chicago Bears 34-0 at halftime, before coasting to a 41-10 victory. In the game Kelce also scored a touchdown. In a postgame interview, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Jr., after learning Swift was in attendance, made sure Kelce would score./nSwift’s appearance also had a halo effect for Kelce and the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs. For example:/n/n/nThe following week Swift was in attendance when Kansas City played the New York Jets in New Jersey’s Meadowlands on NBC’s Sunday Night Football. In the game Kansas City defeated the Jets 23-10. When Front Office Sports reported Swift would be in attendance her fans hoping to get a glimpse of the multiplatinum singer spiked, TickPick reported online ticket prices soared from $83 to $119, a 40% increase. The last time Swift was at the Meadowlands was last May, during her Eras Tour, when she broke attendance records over three days./nInstead of sitting with Kelce’s mother, for the Meadowlands game, Swift came to the game accompanied by such celebrities as Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Sophie Tucker and High Jackman among others./nTravis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates after defeating the Chicago Bears at GEHA ... [+] Field at Arrowhead Stadium on September 24, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri. (Photo by Cooper Neill/Getty Images)/nAs expected, the game was a hit with NBC, which repeatedly showed Swift throughout the game, averaging 27 million viewers on NBC and digital platforms. This was the second most watched NFL game of the season, following the NFL Kick-off Classic last month (27.5 million). Moreover, when compared to the season average, Sunday Night Football ratings among female teens (age 12-to-17) grew by 53%, the audience among women age 18-to-24 increased 24% while women age 35+ rose 34%./nThe audience delivery was also 22% higher than the corresponding game last season (Kansas City vs. Tampa Bay). Sunday Night Football has been the highest rated primetime program on television over the past 12 years. Last season Sunday Night Football averaged 19.9 million viewers including digital platforms./nNext Sunday Kansas City will play a road game against the Minnesota Vikings. Although there has been no announcement that Swift will be attending, ticket sales have also been spiking for that game./nOf note, the first game Swift attended was also the most watched program with females including Woman 18-49 in which Roku TV reported ratings growth of 63%. Females are another group the NFL has been reaching out to. According to a survey conducted last April and reported by Statistica, 24% of the females called themselves avid fans of the NFL, with 42% responding they were not fans at all. By comparison, 51% of males considered themselves avid fans of the NFL with 19% calling themselves not a fan at all./nAlso, as the NFL audience gets older, “Swifties” tend to be younger. A survey from Morning Consult, released earlier this year, found 45% of avid Swift fans are millennials between the ages of 27 and 42 while another 11% are “Gen Z”, under the age of 26. By comparison, last year the median age of the NFL television audience was 54 and aging. (On Amazon
AMZN
 the median age was 47.)/nSwift’s Eras Tour had been generating $13 million in ticket sales each night and is expected to be the highest-grossing concert tour of all time generating billions of dollars. Forbes reported Swift had earned $92 million. The Eras Tour is expected to earn Swift hundreds of millions of dollars. Swift’s net worth is an estimated $740 million./nLooking ahead, the concert film Taylor Swift: The Era Tour will be released in 100+ countries on October 13. Industry analysts project the opening weekend will generate over $100 million in box office. During its Sunday Night Football several promos for the movie aired. Swift’s global concert tour resumes on November 9 in Argentina (a bye week for the Kansas City Chiefs). Next year, the Eras Tour continues with tour dates in Europe, Asia and Australia, before returning to North America in the fall./nBy comparison, Sportrac reports Travis Kelce, a future Hall of Famer, will earn $12.3 million playing in the NFL this season. Over his 11-year NFL career Kelce has earned over $77 million in salary. Another income source for Kelce is product endorsements. Kelce has been a spokesperson for Bud Light, Pfizer

/nAccording to CNN Business, Taylor Swift‘s Eras Tour could gross $2 billion in the U.S. alone. The tour has still yet to begin its second North American leg, which will start in 2024. /nThe price for an average ticket sale for the Eras Tour in the US was about $455.78. However, it is not clear how many tickets were purchased during each order. QuestionPro reports that there were about 72,459 people in attendance at each show./n[RELATED: Taylor Swift Extends North American Dates of Eras Tour Into 2024]/nWhen it’s all said and done, Swift’s Eras Tour is expected to pull in $2.2 billion in revenue, making it the highest-grossing tour of all time. If it gets to its expected gross, Eras will beat out Elton John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour for the top spot, which pulled in a total of $887 million in a five-year period between 2018 and 2023./nNew York University Steinhardt’s Music Business Program Director Larry Miller revealed the revenue information, and also discussed the phenomenon that is Taylor Swift, according to CNN Business.  “We’re talking about a global pop artist who faces virtually infinite demand for those tickets,” Miller said. /nAccording to a QuestionPro poll, the average attendee of the Eras tour in the US spent $291.62 on their own clothing and $214.80 on merchandise purchased after the show. It was revealed that many attendees spent $131.48 on concessions./nJust a few weeks ago, Swift extended the Eras Tour, with new dates popping up in Miami, Indianapolis, Toronto, and New Orleans. “Turns out it’s not the end of an era. Miami, New Orleans, Indy and Toronto: The Eras Tour is coming to you in 2024 with [Gracie Abrams],” Swift wrote on Instagram./nWestern Washington University Professor Jackie Caplan-Auerbach released collected data that showcased that the applause and excitement exhibited by Swift fans at a recent show in Seattle caused activity similar to a small earthquake, according to CNN. “For Taylor Swift, I collected about 10 hours of data where rhythm controlled the behavior,” Caplan-Auerbach told the publication. “The music, the speakers, the beat. All that energy can drive into the ground and shake it./n“I grabbed the data from both nights of the concert and quickly noticed they were clearly the same pattern of signals. If I overlay them on top of each other, they’re nearly identical,” Caplan-Auerbach added. “What I love is to be able to share that this is science. It doesn’t have to happen in a lab with a white coat. Everyday observations and experiences are science.”/nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)/nPhoto by John Shearer/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management/nSee more/nOnly members can comment.

[+] hosted by Z100 New York and presented by Goldfish Puffs at Madison Square Garden on December 12, 2014 in New York City.  (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for iHeartMedia)/nTaylor Swift is currently juggling various projects and accomplishments while simultaneously looking towards the future. Amidst her ongoing The Eras Tour, the sales of her latest album, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), are thriving, and her single ""Cruel Summer"" is looking to claim the top spot on the Hot 100 chart. Despite these impressive feats, one of Swift's most prominent singles is staging a remarkable resurgence./n""Blank Space,"" a signature hit from Swift, is making an unexpected and intriguing comeback, gaining momentum gradually yet consistently. The song is undergoing a resurgence in popularity that has taken many by surprise, leaving the potential for its growth virtually limitless./nLast week, ""Blank Space"" reappeared on the Hot 100 chart at No. 49. Billboard's regulations usually prevent tracks that have spent a certain number of weeks on the chart from making a return unless they regain enough popularity to secure a place within the top half. Consequently, when a song is eventually removed from the list or naturally falls off, it typically remains absent from then on./n""Blank Space"" defied these odds, and it didn’t stop there./nRemarkably, within just one week after its reappearance, ""Blank Space"" has climbed a few notches to reach No. 46 on the current Hot 100. All indications suggest that this upward trend could persist in the forthcoming weeks, allowing the song to continue its ascent./nThe resurgence of “Blank Space” can be attributed to Swift’s announcement that her next re-recorded album will be the iconic 1989. This pop blockbuster propelled ""Blank Space"" to the forefront as its second single, eventually hitting No. 1 on the Hot 100./nSwift's dedicated fans swiftly flocked to the original album following the mid-concert announcement of 1989 (Taylor’s Version), catapulting it back into the top 10 of the Billboard 200 ranking. Evidently, among all the tracks on the title, ""Blank Space"" has gained the favor of the masses. With a surge in streams and purchases of the song, coupled with what must be at least a noticeable number of radio programmers reintroducing it into their rotations, ""Blank Space"" has exceeded expectations, securing a place on the Hot 100 one again./n""Blank Space"" has already achieved the remarkable milestone of being certified eight times platinum, reflecting the fact that it has moved eight million equivalent copies in the United States alone. Given its current trajectory, it's entirely plausible that ""Blank Space"" could achieve diamond status by reaching the 10 million equivalent units mark in the coming months./n",5.461879762,323,Discography,1

[+] Monday, Aug. 7, 2023.  (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” is one of the hottest songs in America right now. It’s been living inside the top 10 on the Hot 100 for months, and it keeps approaching the summit, coming tantalizing close to the No. 1 spot. Whether the tune will reach the peak position or not is yet to be seen, but whether it does or doesn’t, the track’s legacy is already cemented due to its near-unprecedented success at radio./nInitially released in 2019 as part of Swift's album Lover, ""Cruel Summer"" was intended to be a single from the pop record. The singer never got to realize those plans at the time, as the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic forced a change of course. Swift embarked on her highly anticipated The Eras Tour in 2023, and it was during this trek that the song experienced a resurgence, breaking free from the confines of being only a fan favorite./nThe song's revival was nothing short of remarkable. It swiftly climbed the streaming charts, catching the attention of Swift and her team. Against all expectations, ""Cruel Summer"" was officially released as a single, four years after its initial drop. Its impact was immediate, with the song ascending to the upper echelons of the Hot 100 and earning a spot in the top 10./nIts Hot 100 presence is impressive, but the true measure of the song's success lies in its dominance on Billboard's radio charts. The single has become a historic win on most of the pop-focused tallies, breaking records and proving Swift’s dominance...and doing so as an incredibly unlikely win, to boot./n""Cruel Summer"" achieved the remarkable feat of becoming Taylor Swift's twelfth No. 1 hit on the Pop Airplay chart, which tracks the most popular tunes at pop radio in the U.S. With this latest win, she surpassed the records of other chart-toppers like Maroon 5, Katy Perry, and Rihanna, making Swift the reigning queen of the Pop Airplay list./nBut the accolades didn't stop there. ""Cruel Summer"" also conquered the Adult Pop Airplay chart, which is aimed at more mature listeners. The tune claimied the No. 1 spot and marking Swift's eleventh leader on this particular chart. In fact, she holds the record for the most No. 1 hits among all soloists in the history of the Adult Pop Airplay chart, trailing only Maroon 5's record of 15 No. 1s./nIn October 2023, the song achieved another milestone by topping the overall Radio Songs chart. This list ranks songs across genres, making Swift's eight chart-toppers—including “Cruel Summer”—on this ranking all the more impressive. With this latest smash, she now claims fourth place among all acts for the most No. 1 hits on the Radio Songs tally and became the third-highest-ranking woman, breaking her tie with Katy Perry./nWhile ""Cruel Summer"" may not have claimed the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 chart as some had hoped—at least not yet—the decision to release it as a single proved to be a smart move. The song not only performed exceptionally well, likely justifying the investment, but it also propelled Swift to historic heights and new records on various Billboard charts./nIn the grand scheme of Swift's illustrious career, ""Cruel Summer"" stands as an unlikely and remarkable triumph. Even if it never ascends to the top of the Hot 100, its legacy is secure./n",0,324,Discography,1

Here's everything we know so far!,https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/1989-taylors-version-5148207/,hollywoodlife,general,us,2023-08-09T18:39:01+00:00,FALSE,TRUE,329,"
				All five vault track titles for '1989 (Taylor's Version)' were revealed on Sept. 20. Here's everything we know so far about the highly-anticipated album.			/n

/n/nTaylor Swift took the stage in Los Angeles on Aug. 9 for her Eras Tour and confirmed that her next album, 1989 (Taylor’s Version) will be coming out on October 27. Over a month later, Taylor revealed all five of her vault track titles after she had fans unscramble word clues on Google. The singer has been gifting fans with new and never-before-heard music like crazy over the last few years, and she doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon. In three years, she’s released three brand new albums (Midnights, Folklore and Evermore), as well as three re-recorded versions of her old albums Fearless, Speak Now and Red, so she can reclaim the rights to them. Although Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) just came out on July 7, Taylor is already diving into the next era./nThe timing of making the 1989 announcement was too perfect, as Taylor closed out the first U.S. leg of her Eras Tour on Aug. 9, which just so happens to be 8/9. The concert wrapped a six show run at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. Because of this milestone, coupled with the ‘8/9’ date, fans were wondering for weeks if the singer would be announcing 1989 (Taylor’s Version) at the show — and she delivered. Earlier this year, she confirmed the release date for Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) at a different Eras Tour concert./nOfficial album cover for ‘1989 (Taylor’s Version)’ out October 27. pic.twitter.com/LaCjouiwua/n— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) August 10, 2023/n/nHere’s everything we know about 1989 (Taylor’s Version) so far/nThe release date for 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is October 27, 2023. Ahead of the announcement, Taylor dropped plenty of hits that it would be the next of her six re-recorded albums to come out. On July 7, she released the music video for her Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) song “I Can See You,” and it concluded with a BIG 1989 Easter egg. As Taylor drove away at the end of the video, there was a sign above a bridge that said “1989 TV.” Fans took this as Taylor’s way of letting them know that 1989 would be coming next./n1989 was the fifth album in Taylor’s original repertoire and there have also been plenty of “5” hints recently. In the “I Can See You” video, five security guards chased down Joey King and Taylor Lautner as they tried to rescue Taylor and symbolically help her reclaim her work. Back in October, when Taylor released the music video for “Bejeweled,” her character rode an elevator and got off on floor 3 first (signifying album 3, Speak Now, as the next release). However, she then rode the elevator up to floor 5, hinting that album 5, 1989, would be after that./n/nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)/n/nThe music video for “Karma,” which was released in May 2023, also provided a 1989 hint. At the time of its premiere, the date for Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) had already been announced, so there was no more hints needed about that record. The “Karma” video featured Taylor posing as a statue with the roman numeral MCMLXXXIX written on it. Yes, this translates to ‘1989.’/nThen, at the August 9 show of her Eras Tour in Los Angeles, she made multiple changes to the set that further hinted at the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) release. During the show, she rocked four never-before-worn outfits, and they were all blue. During the Speak Now, Folklore and 1989 eras, as well as for the surprise songs of the evening, Taylor’s looks were different than we’d ever seen before, as they were all blue for the first time. It wasn’t coincidental, either, because it coincided with the announcement!/nWith all of her re-records, Taylor has included new versions of every original track from the records, so the first part of the tracklist is easily predictable. Although 1989 hasn’t come out yet, fans have gotten a sneak peek at what to expect, as Taylor has dropped the re-recorded versions of “Wildest Dreams” and “This Love” already./nThe fun doesn’t end there, though. She’s also dived back “into the vault” of songs that didn’t make each album the first time around. Taylor re-recorded these (mostly) never-before-heard vault tracks from each era, as well, and included those on the Taylor’s Versions of her albums. Fearless (TV) and Speak Now (TV) both had six vault tracks, while Red had seven, as well as three other tracks that weren’t on the original version of Red. Ahead of the 1989 (TV) release, Taylor’s website confirmed that there would be five vault tracks on the 1989 re-record, in addition to the 16 songs from the original album./nTaylor revealed all five of the vault tracks with help from Google on Sept. 20. The “Swifties” were challenged with an internet scavenger hunt where they had to unscramble word clues to uncover the titles of four of the vault tracks. Those four songs were revealed to be “Is It Over Now?”, “Now That We Don’t Talk,” “Say Don’t Go,” and “Suburban Legends.” Taylor revealed that the fifth vault track is called “Slut!”/nHere’s the full track list for 1989: Taylor’s Version:/nAs always, we have to reiterate that Taylor never confirms who her songs are about. However, there are plenty of hints that point to Harry Styles being her main muse for the 1989 album. The two dated in 2012 and beginning of 2013, which lines up perfectly with the Oct. 2014 release date of 1989. One of the most obvious references, of course, is track three, “Style,” which is a literal play on Harry’s last name./nThe songs “I Know Places” and “Out Of The Woods” both tell a similar tale about a relationship that seems like it could be doomed from the start. However, the song’s subjects are willing to fight the scrutiny to try to make it work, even if they know it will end badly. Unsurprisingly, Taylor and Harry were the subject of intense media attention during their relationship, and were constantly trying to get away from the eyes that were on them. “Out Of The Woods” actually makes two VERY direct references to Harry, as Taylor sings about his “paper airplane” necklace and the stitches he got on his forehead after a snowmobiling accident when they were together./nMeanwhile, “All You Had To Do Was Stay” and “I Wish You Would” reference the ending and reconnecting in a relationship. In the former, Taylor calls out her lover for leaving her and then trying to come back into her life. But, in the latter, after some time has gone by, she admits that she wishes he would be part of her life again. This reflects the on and off cycle of Taylor and Harry’s relationship, as it’s rumored that they had a fling in early 2012 before publicly getting together at the end of that year. On “This Love,” she sings about resurrecting an old romance, as well./nThese days, Taylor and Harry are on great terms. They were even seen chatting at the Grammy Awards in both 2023 and 2021. Some fans are even speculating that Harry could pop up as a featured artist on one of the 1989 vault songs!/nOf course, not all of the songs are about Mr. Styles! “Bad Blood” was written about a feud with Katy Perry, but the ladies have since squashed their beef. “Blank Space” is a play on all of the media attention that Taylor’s love life gets, and her way of mocking the fake stories about her romances. The album’s lead single, “Shake It Off,” is a dance track, where Taylor sings about shaking off her haters. Meanwhile, “You Are In Love” was inspired by Taylor’s co-writer, Jack Antonoff, and his relationship with Lena Dunham (the two have since broken up)./n

(Photo by Mat Hayward/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTonight (August 9) marks a significant moment in Taylor Swift's ongoing touring journey as she prepares to deliver the final performance of the first leg of her incredibly successful The Eras Tour. Taking place at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, CA, the concert will be the sixth consecutive show at the iconic venue, and her last one in America for now./nSwift's tour has already found its place in the history books, and while she plans the next sections of the jaunt, fans are abuzz with anticipation for what could potentially unfold on this evening./nSwifties have been fervently speculating for a considerable time now about what the singer may reveal tonight. Their speculation centers on the possibility of Swift announcing the release date for her next re-recorded album, 1989 (Taylor’s Version). While the Grammy winner herself has refrained from confirming anything, the multitude of clues woven into her recent activities is undeniably intriguing, and they all align perfectly with her well-known penchant for doling out hints./nA particularly conspicuous clue emerged via a tweet shared by SoFi Stadium. The venue extended a warm welcome to the songstress before she arrived, accompanied by a series of artfully altered photos. One of these visuals prominently featured a lifeguard shack positioned against a beach backdrop, cleverly emblazoned with the words “1989 (Taylor’s Version).” This visual breadcrumb is hard to dismiss and immediately sent fans's excitement soaring./nIn Swift’s universe, every detail carries significance, and the date of the culmination of the first American leg of The Eras Tour is no exception. The date, 8/9, holds some purpose as the last two digits of the year 1989. While this connection might seem tenuous to some, Swift's history of incorporating cryptic clues into her work lends credence to the notion that there's more than meets the eye. She has hinted with less in the past./nSwift's recent actions have only fueled the speculation surrounding 1989 (Taylor’s Version). Just weeks ago, as she promoted her latest re-release, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), she unveiled a music video for the track ""I Can See You."" The visual featured a getaway car cruising beneath a sign that conspicuously read ""1'-9'' 8.9tv."" The appearance of the numbers 1989 is noteworthy, but Swift aficionados sense that the inclusion of “TV” is simply too deliberate a nod, as it is a commonly-used abbreviation for Taylor’s Version./nThe re-recordings saga still has three more albums left before Swift is done. She has already released Fearless (Taylor’s Version), Red (Taylor’s Version) and most recently, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version). All three have quickly ascended to the summit of the Billboard 200 chart and become both commercial and critical triumphs./nWhile Swift has not outlined a specific timeline for the rollout of the remaining trio of re-recordings, her swift progress thus far suggests that her dedication to the project remains resolute. She likely wants to wrap this up, and she’s already doled out two projects in 2021, so doing so in 2023 wouldn’t be too odd./nWhile it is entirely plausible that she will unveil news of 1989 (Taylor’s Version) during the show, she could just as well keep her audience and the world guessing. Swift's fondness for dropping meticulously crafted Easter eggs lends itself to the possibility that these hints may be a playful diversion or, conversely, a carefully woven tapestry of hidden meanings./nOnly time will unravel the truth, but with two tracks from 1989 (Taylor’s Version) already out and a tapestry of suggestions coming from either Swift herself or those around her, the prospect of the album's imminent announcement seems to grow more plausible by the moment./n",16.76494155,332,Discography,0

Serban Ghenea, one of pop’s most in-demand engineers, tied Bridgers and Monét with seven nominations./nIn a telling demonstration of where much of music’s energy resides these days, Batiste is the only male artist up for the album and record awards with his “World Music Radio” LP and his single “Worship,” respectively. Batiste, whose “We Are” took album of the year in 2022 in an upset victory over Swift and Rodrigo, is nominated for the song prize, as well, for “Butterfly” — the only tune in that category performed by a man. The other LPs nominated for album of the year (the Grammys’ equivalent of best picture) are Swift’s “Midnights,” Cyrus’ “Endless Summer Vacation,” Rodrigo’s “Guts,” Janelle Monáe’s frisky R&B set “The Age of Pleasure” and “Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd” by the critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey./n“Women had dang good music — some of the biggest records of the year and the biggest songs,” Recording Academy chief executive Harvey Mason Jr. said in an interview. “And our voters were obviously moved by a lot of it.”/nMason assumed his role in 2021, pledging to diversify both the academy’s executive ranks and its voting membership of more than 11,000 recording industry professionals in response to longstanding criticism that the organization overvalued the work of older white men. “We’ve definitely made huge strides, and it’s having an impact on who’s getting nominated,” he said./n Music /nWhile country and regional Mexican music both enjoyed record-breaking chart success this year, there’s little acknowledgement of those genres in the top categories./nNov. 10, 2023/nThe remaining nominees for record of the year — which goes to performers and producers, while song of the year recognizes songwriters — are Cyrus’ “Flowers,” Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?,” Rodrigo’s “Vampire” and Swift’s “Anti-Hero,” each a monster hit on streaming platforms and Top 40 radio. (Compare “Flowers’” 1.5 billion Spotify streams to the 1.2 million for Batiste’s “Worship” to get a sense of Grammy voters’ fondness for his feel-good messaging and his old-fashioned musical know-how.)/n“Flowers,” “What Was I Made For?,” “Vampire” and “Anti-Hero” are all nominated for song of the year as well, along with Del Rey’s “A&W” and Dua Lipa’s “Dance the Night,” which like the Eilish tune originated in director Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster “Barbie” movie. Swift’s nod for “Anti-Hero” brings her career nominations in the song category to seven — more than anyone else has earned in Grammy history. A win by Swift for album of the year at the upcoming ceremony, set for Feb. 4 at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles, would be her fourth, breaking her current tie with Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon and Stevie Wonder./nIt would also cap a year in which Swift has been the most inescapable story in pop music as a result of her record-breaking Eras tour — a show Mason compared to “going to see LeBron James play basketball” — and the smash concert film that accompanies it.

After two years in which the academy selected 10 nominees for each of the top four categories, the organization lowered the number to eight for February’s show, a rule change Mason attributed to members who felt the higher number was “clouding the field and maybe diluting” the honor of a nomination./nFor best new artist, Monét will compete against a fellow R&B vocalist in Coco Jones, who got her start as an actor on the Disney Channel; the other nominees are rapper Ice Spice, singer-songwriters Gracie Abrams and Noah Kahan, dance artist Fred Again and a pair of Nashville acts in Jelly Roll, who this week won the Country Music Assn.’s new artist prize, and the husband-and-wife duo the War and Treaty./n Music /nThe 2024 Grammy nominations were revealed today, in 94 categories. SZA leads the field with nine nominations. /nNov. 10, 2023/nGiven the huge year country music has had on the charts, it’s not shocking to see more than one country act in the running for best new artist for just the third time this century. Yet country hitmakers including Luke Combs, Zach Bryan and Lainey Wilson were left out of the Grammys’ top categories, scoring nods only for the ceremony’s various country awards. Morgan Wallen, whose “One Thing at a Time” is 2023’s biggest commercial hit of any genre, received no nominations for the third year in a row, though the songwriters of his Hot 100-topping “Last Night” were recognized in the country song category./nMason said he was “really surprised” by the lack of high-level nominations for country artists. “And for Latin, which continues to have massive commercial and critical success,” he added. Many observers expected Peso Pluma, one of the young stars of the booming regional Mexican music scene, to be nominated for best new artist; instead, he got only a single nod, in the música Mexicana album category for “Génesis.” The música urbana category features just three nominated works — Rauw Alejandro’s “Saturno,” Karol G’s “Mañana Será Bonito” and Tainy’s “Data” — because, the academy noted, it received fewer than 40 submissions for the award. /n“That tells us we need to continue to develop our membership — to continue reaching into those communities and getting more voters,” Mason said./nRap was also largely overlooked for major prizes, in part because established Grammy faves such as Kendrick Lamar, Lil Nas X and Cardi B didn’t release albums during the eligibility window. Lamar is nominated for rap performance with “The Hillbillies,” a single by his duo of the same name with his cousin Baby Keem. For rap album, Travis Scott’s streaming hit “Utopia” will vie against Killer Mike’s “Michael,” Metro Boomin’s “Heroes & Villains,” Nas’ “King’s Disease III” and “Her Loss” by Drake and 21 Savage./nThe race for producer of the year, non-classical, will pit Jack Antonoff — who won in 2022 and again at the most recent Grammys thanks to his work with Swift and Del Rey, among others — against Dernst “D’Mile” Emile II, Hit-Boy, Metro Boomin and Daniel Nigro. The nominees for songwriter of the year, non-classical, which was awarded for the first time this past February, are Edgar Barrera, Jessie Jo Dillon, Shane McAnally, Theron Thomas and Justin Tranter./nThe category of audio book, narration and storytelling recording is a jumble of boldfaced names, with nods for Meryl Streep, William Shatner, Rick Rubin, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama./nA number of classic-rock icons turned up in specialty categories like historical album, in which Bob Dylan’s “Fragments — Time Out of Mind Sessions (1996-1997): The Bootleg Series, Vol 17” is nominated, and music film, for which director Brett Morgen’s David Bowie movie “Moonage Daydream” will compete against “I Am Everything,” a documentary about Little Richard directed by Lisa Cortés. The Rolling Stones scored a nod for “Angry” in the rock song category, which also includes Foo Fighters’ “Rescued,” Boygenius’ “Not Strong Enough,” Queens of the Stone Age’s “Emotion Sickness” and Rodrigo’s “Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl.” /nBoygenius, in which Bridgers is joined by fellow singer-songwriters Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, garnered additional nominations for rock performance, alternative music performance and alternative music album, making it the most-nominated act in the traditionally male-dominated rock and alternative fields./nThe nominations, which were revealed in a livestreamed event on Friday, come just two days after an unnamed female musician filed a lawsuit against former academy head Neil Portnow, whom she said drugged and raped her in a New York hotel room in 2018. Portnow, who denies the accusations, stepped down as chief executive in 2019 after he was widely condemned for saying that women in music should “step up” in order to be recognized for awards such as the Grammys./nPortnow’s departure set off turmoil within the academy including the hiring and quick firing of the group’s next leader, Deborah Dugan, who said she was ousted for calling attention to a variety of financial and ethical violations inside the organization. Mason, who declined to comment on the allegations against Portnow, took over on an interim basis in 2020 before being officially appointed the following year./nBig winners at the 65th Grammys included Harry Styles, whose “Harry’s House” took album of the year; Lizzo, whose “About Damn Time” won record of the year; Bonnie Raitt, whose “Just Like That” was named song of the year; and jazz singer Samara Joy, who won best new artist./nIt's a date/nGet our L.A.

Both the LAPD and the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department placed extra patrols on trains after a man was killed Wednesday night on the to the K (Crenshaw) Line, one station away from the Hawthorne/Lennox Station that ran one of two shuttle buses that dropped off fans at the stadium./nMetro rail lines A, B, D, E, C and K will operate late, until 2 a.m. to accommodate Swifties after the concerts, which run Aug. 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9. Since no train actually stops at SoFi, two free shuttles took passengers directly to the concert venue from a train station. One ran from the K (Crenshaw) Line’s Downtown Inglewood Station. The other ran from the C Line’s Hawthorne/Lennox Station. The shuttles will run 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. before each show, and for 90 minutes after the concerts./nBut the two shuttles were not full Thursday and the line to get on board the K Line at the Downtown Inglewood Station was nearly empty around 5 p.m., as extra accommodations went unneeded./nRows of security tape forming snaking lines before the shuttles became merely decorative as buses came and went with space inside to spare. A pop-up stand at one station selling TAP cards — in anticipation that there may be long lines at its three vending machines — struggled to get any traffic./nThose who did take public transit often rode early and were prepared in advance./nViridiana Gonzalez and Victoria Kravitz knew they wanted the peace of mind of riding Metro. The pair, who have been friends and Swift fans since high school, left from Arcadia on the A Line, wanting to avoid the frustrations that might come from riding with their parents./nKravitz said the more than two-hour public transit commute wasn’t a concern, and well worth it to escape the anxiety of traffic, parking, or other logistics./n“We get to get there early and enjoy the atmosphere and experience,” she said. “That’s better than stressing with my parents for two hours.”/nMany concert-goers were being dropped off in the ride-hailing lot at SoFi. Those who beat the crowds and got there early seemed to fare better./nCeline Castaneda took a Lyft from Long Beach to SoFi that took only 40 minutes and cost her $45. She arrived shortly before 11 a.m./n“I may carpool after the concert with some of the people I met,” she said./nGail Gallaher of Pasadena took the A Line train from the Memorial Park Station at around 2:30 p.m after waiting more than 20 minutes./nShe planned on meeting her husband at the stadium, after he parks their car at a school that rented out parking spaces. The couple had reserved a space there ahead of time./nWhile the train connections were a bit like alphabet soup, she is a veteran Metro user and felt confident she could find her way. “I am taking the A Line,” she said, pausing for several seconds, “to the God I don’t even know I think the Expo Line, then to the K Line, then to the shuttle that will get us to SoFi.”/nFor many Swifties, the concert is just part of the night out. And that’s what they say makes her concerts different.

I don’t believe this moment is happening because it is here already,” she said. She bought the tickets as part of the original sale by Ticketmaster, not through a re-sale, she said.

The trophy has gone to some surprising titles and artists recently, but there aren’t too many shocks in the field this time around./nBut who will end up winning isn’t clear, and that may be where the shock lies./nThis nomination might be more surprising if Jon Batiste hadn’t not only broken into the Album of the Year field two years ago, but won the prize in a stunning upset with his previous offering We Are. Now he’s back with Marc Whitmore, an engineer/mixer who also won for We Are./nProducer and songwriter Jon Bellion earns his third Album of the Year nomination, while engineer/mixer Laura Sisk nabs an incredible three nods this year (also with frequent collaborator Taylor Swift and Lana Del Rey), increasing her career total to seven nominations in this group./nWorld Music Radio stands as Batiste’s second-highest-charting album on the Billboard 200, thanks in large part to his newfound popularity following his previous Album of the Year win. The set peaked at No. 104 on the tally./nIt’s rarely seen these days, but everyone who is nominated for working on Boygenius’ The Record appears in the Album of the Year category for the first time. That includes not only the three women who make up the alternative rock band, but also all the producers, mixers and engineers./nWhile she was never nominated for her own work, Miley Cyrus actually appears in the Album of the Year field for the second time. She was previously up for the honor–one of her two early Grammy nods — as a featured act on Lil Nas X’s Montero./nNow, her recent top 10 title, which benefits immensely from its lead single “Flowers,” brings plenty of others back to the field./nPerhaps most notably, Mike “Spike” Stent, the mixer/engineer, collects two more Album of the Year nods this time around, hitting 10 total chances to win–including with Olivia Rodrigo as well. Producers Kid Harpoon and Mike Will-Made-It are back for the third time, with Harpoon having won alongside Harry Styles for Harry’s House.

Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd may very well be the longest title to be featured in this category, and it was also Del Rey’s milestone tenth top 10 on the Billboard 200./nProducer Jack Antonoff is nominated against himself this year–also with Swift–and now he’s landed eight Album of the Year nods. Michael Harris, the engineer/mixer, is back for a second time./nThis is a bit of a surprise. Janelle Monáe is adored by critics, but even the most ardent supporters likely had a tough time suggesting that this album was a success. The title came five years after her last full-length, Dirty Computer, which was also nominated for Album of the Year, but it didn’t make the same impact. The set peaked at No. 17 and quickly faded away, but clearly not in the minds of voters./nThe Age of Pleasure actually marks Monáe’s third Album of the Year nod, as she was featured on fun.’s Some Nights, which, coincidentally, marked Antonoff’s first chance to win as well. Now they’re nominated against one another./nThe most-nominated person on this project is mastering engineer Dave Kutch, who collects his ninth Album of the Year nod. Amazingly, he’s never won./nMick Guzauski, one of the mixers/engineers, returns for a fifth Album of the Year nomination. He’s been working for decades, and he first appeared in this vertical in 2000 with the Backstreet Boys’ Millennium. /nFellow collaborators Nate ""Rocket"" Wonder and Nathaniel Irvin III double their Album of the Year nod count thanks to working with Monáe again, as they were up for the honor with Dirty Computer./nOlivia Rodrigo and her songwriting partner and producer Dan Nigro have now worked on two albums together, and both were up for this Grammy. Guts was even bigger than the singer’s debut, and it went right to No. 1. It followed closely in sound from her debut, Sour, which turned out to be a smart move on her part. That title also earned Mitch McCarthy, one of the engineers/mixers on Guts, a nod as well./nWhile Rodrigo and Nigro may still be relatively new to this category, Guts also features some very seasoned vets. Serban Ghenea hits 20 Album of the Year nominations with his two chances to win this year, including Swift’s Midnights. Randy Merrill, the mastering engineer, is also nominated for both Guts and Midnights, increasing his career total to 12 Album of the Year nods./nSpeaking of Midnights, of course it’s here! The full-length stood out as one of the biggest releases of 2022, and it’s continued to perform incredibly well throughout 2023. Critics and fans alike adored the No. 1 bestseller, which spun off 10 top 10 hits – all at the same time, by the way./nSwift has now been nominated for Album of the Year six times, and she’s already won in half of those instances — an incredible track record./nThe superstar is joined by talents who have been here many times before, including more than once this year, like the previously named Antonoff, Merrill, Sisk and Ghenea. Also, Mixer/engineer Mikey Freedom Hart collects his third Album of the Year nod, while Sean Hutchinson, Ken Lewis and Evan Smith, who are credited in the same capacity, are back for a second time–with most of them having debuted in this category with Swift./nSZA is a first-time nominee as an artist, as her No. 1 SOS, is a serious contender for the prize.

Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, eager to demonstrate her Big Labor bonafides, really stepped in it with her recent call on singer Taylor Swift to postpone planned concerts in Los Angeles to appease a hotel workers union./nAccording to Politico, Kounalakis signed a letter signed by Democratic politicians like Asm. Isaac Bryan of Culver City – best known for his recent opposition to categorizing human trafficking of minors for sexual purposes as a “serious” crime – and Sen. Dave Min of Irvine – best known for his recent drunk driving arrest – calling on Swift to “support” striking hotel workers by putting off shows which begin Thursday./n“Hotel workers are fighting for their lives. They are fighting for a living wage. They have gone on strike. Now, they are asking for your support,” the lawmakers breathlessly wrote in the letter. “Speak Now! Stand with hotel workers and postpone your concerts.”/nFor related news, see: Politicians urge Taylor Swift to postpone LA concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers/nHow, exactly, this would help the cause of hotel workers is a mystery. But it would certainly punish music fans looking for entertainment. This is understood by at least one Democrat, Sen. Josh Becker, who tweeted, “This seems like a bad idea to me. So many people have bought tickets, some overpaying on the resale market. Clearly we can find other ways to support the strikers that don’t dash the dreams of young fans who have been so looking forward to this concert.”/nAlas, considering the union and politics involved, reason is too much to ask for./nFor related news, see: Taylor Swift should ignore the hollow hysterics of Unite Here Local 11 and continue shows as normal/nThe union, Unite Here Local 11, has been known throughout Southern California for trying to force hotel establishments into unionization.

As far as we can tell, Kounalakis’ most notable interaction with unions traces back to her 2019 arrangement of having unions help pony up hundreds of thousands of dollars to refurbish her office./nNow, she is illogically calling on Taylor Swift to punish her fans to somehow show support for union activists. In a wonderful demonstration of hypocrisy, Kounalakis joins this call despite having just attended a Taylor Swift show herself, according to Politico./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nThis editorial board regrets this poorly thought out political stunt from Kounalakis and notes her hypocritical approach to politics.

This placement is particularly noteworthy, as it represents Jung Kook's first appearance on the Billboard 200 outside of his work with BTS./nGolden starts in the runner-up position with an impressive 210,200 equivalent album units. This figure includes 122,000 pure sales, with the remainder primarily comprising streaming equivalent units. The No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 is held by Taylor Swift's 1989 (Taylor's Version) for the second consecutive week, as it moved another 245,000 equivalent units—significantly lower than its debut week, when it exceeded 1.6 million units./nJung Kook came close to becoming the first South Korean musician to achieve a No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. However, he narrowly missed this distinction by just a few thousand equivalent units, with Swift refusing to give up her control over the top spot./nAs Golden starts in the runner-up rung, Jung Kook is now the fourth member of BTS to debut an album at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. Amazingly, this marks the fourth instance of this showing in 2023 alone, following Suga, Jimin, and V, who all similarly barely missed securing the top spot./nWhile Golden didn't quite manage to surpass 1989 (Taylor's Version) on the Billboard 200, it still represents a significant win for Jung Kook and South Korean artists in general. It is now tied as the highest-charting album in U.S. history by a soloist from the Asian nation./nAdditionally, the album has been highly successful in terms of individual songs. Golden produced a Hot 100 No. 1 hit with ""Seven,"" featuring Latto, and the follow-up single, ""3D"" with Jack Harlow, debuted at No. 5 on the same chart. Jung Kook's new single, ""Standing Next To You,"" is also expected to make a high debut on the Hot 100, potentially landing inside the top 10./n",3.46515007,343,Achievements,1

But she’s not mad about being labeled a Swiftie (as Ms. Swift’s fans are nicknamed), since she is one of those as well./n“I went to Eras three times,” Ms. Gitles said of Swift’s wildly successful Eras Tour. “It’s the best coincidence of all time that my favorite musical artist is joining the best football team of all time.” (She also shared the lyrics she came up with that Ms. Swift could sing if her relationship to Mr. Kelce falls through: “He played the field like he played me. A travesty.”)/nOther people who stopped to chat in Secaucus were Hana Kim, 24, and Courtney Takahashi, 25, both special education teachers in Westchester. The duo couldn’t afford tickets for Ms. Swift’s concert at the MetLife Stadium in May, so they sat in the parking lot outside the stadium and listened to the whole thing from their cars instead. “We Taylorgated,” said Ms. Takahashi./n“We bought football tickets as soon as the news came out,” said Ms. Takahashi. “I don’t even care if we see her. Just being in her presence, breathing the same air, feeling her vibe, that is good enough for me.”/nOutside the stadium, as some fans were tailgating with grills and coolers of beer, others were brainstorming the best way to get a peek at Ms. Swift./n“I’ve been looking at social media, waiting to see if we could see which box she was in and if we could see her,” said Shae Mermis, 33, who lives in Crown Heights and was at the game with her girlfriend and parents./nStella Fee, 44, and her daughter, Zoe Fee, decided they would hang out on the V.I.P. level. “We are season ticket holders in the level below, so we are allowed to go up a floor to where the boxes are,” she said./nFans had varying ideas for appropriate game day outfits./nAs soon as she saw Ms. Swift in Mr. Kelce’s box last week at the Chiefs game in Kansas City, Caye Schnackel, 26, a fashion designer who lives in Brooklyn, decided she and her boyfriend would have to dress as the celebrity couple for Halloween. “I looked at him and said, ‘I am going to be Taylor, and you are going to be Kelce,’ and that was that,” she said./nShe found the perfect outfit at Nova Lee Boutique — a bright red jersey with 87 written on it, made entirely of sequins — and had it overnighted so she could get it in time to wear to Sunday’s game in addition to Halloween./n“I’m just so obsessed with Travis now,” she said. “I am so jealous of Taylor. I am going to try and win him over today.” (Her boyfriend, Krzysztof Miezgiel, who was next to her, just laughed.)/nSean Patrick, 47, went to a T-shirt printing company at a local mall the morning of the game to try and get the saying, “Where’s Taylor?” printed, but he was told it wouldn’t be ready in time. His friend, Tom Wagner, 59, from Manahawkin, N.Y., went to Walmart and bought the largest pink sweatshirt he could find but it still didn’t fit. So they decided to take pink masking tape, write phrases about Taylor Swift on it with a marker, and attach them to football jerseys./nThe pair spent four hours tailgating in the parking lot, making pulled pork and chicken on four different grills and watching other football games on a television they set up with a portable satellite dish. “We had about 50 people come up to us and ask to take photos,” said Mr. Wagner. “I’ve never had more fun at a Jets game in my life.”/n“The atmosphere is crazy,” he added. “I’ve never seen a team bring a crowd like this.”/nAdvertisement",-7.119766476,346,Social impact,1

[+] Soldier Field on June 2, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois.  (Photo by John Shearer/TAS18/Getty Images for TAS)/nTaylor Swift has three songs on the Hot 100 this week, but one stands out among the bunch thanks to its longstanding popularity. The superstar’s “Anti-Hero” is not just the longest-charting of her current trio of wins, but it’s recently become one of the sturdiest hits of her career./n""Anti-Hero"" celebrates 48 weeks on the Hot 100 as of this frame. That’s an incredible length of time for any track to spend on the ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S., and it’s one that Swift has reached before…but not very often./nWith 48 weeks spent on the Hot 100, “Anti-Hero” is now tied with another one of Swift’s most popular singles as the third-longest-charting tune of her career. At present, “Anti-Hero” is on the same level as her early win “Teardrops on My Guitar."" That cut disappeared from the list in 2008 after 48 frames./nAhead of both “Anti-Hero” and “Teardrops on My Guitar” are just three other songs from Swift. That’s a very small sum, considering she’s sent a total of 212 tracks to the tally throughout her time in the spotlight. Two tracks are currently tied as her longest-charting hits, as both “You Belong With Me” and “Shake It Off” racked up 50 weeks on the tally./nJust one frame ahead of “Anti-Hero” is “Love Story.” That smash, which helped catapult Swift to superstardom more than a decade ago, lived on the list for 49 weeks./n“Anti-Hero” is still going strong on the Hot 100, as it’s up several spots this time around. The tune advances from No. 31 to No. 26 in its forty-eighth week on the ranking. Seeing how well it’s still doing, it’s likely that next week, “Anti-Hero” will still be able to find space on the chart. When it does, the Midnights single will break its tie with “Teardrops on My Guitar” and match “Love Story” as one of Swift’s second-longest-charting smashes./n",10.97778011,347,Achievements,1
348,Dane Mizutani,"Never mind the Taylor Swift hysteria, Vikings more concerned with Travis Kelce’s other connection",The rapport Kelce has with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is on another level.,https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/06/never-mind-the-taylor-swift-hysteria-vikings-more-concerned-with-travis-kelces-other-connection/,twincities,general,us,2023-10-06T18:24:47+00:00,FALSE,TRUE,348,"Travis Kelce has been the best tight end in the NFL for the better part of a decade. He has helped turn the Kansas City Chiefs into a modern-day NFL dynasty, serving as the main target for superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes en route to winning two Super Bowls since 2020. The dynamic duo has become the gold standard across the league./nStill, the 34-year-old Kelce has never been bigger than he is right now. His budding romance with singer Taylor Swift has skyrocketed his stardom over the past month. As well known as Kelce already was in the sports world, some would say Swift truly put him on the map./nThe reaction speaks for itself. In the aftermath of Swift attending a home game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City last month, Kelce’s jersey sales spiked nearly 400 percent. She made another appearance at a road game at MetLife Stadium in New York last week and the cameras panned to her suite more than a dozen times. The main storyline this week with the Vikings set to host the defending Super Bowl champions is whether Swift is going to show up at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis./nThe hysteria has gotten so out of hand that Kelce recently admitted that he thinks the NFL has gone overboard with its coverage of his relationship with Swift./nWhat does Vikings tight end T.J. Hockenson think of the attention his good friend has been getting?/n“He always gets a lot of attention,” Hockenson said. “I don’t think anything has changed.”/nHe paused./n“OK,” Hockenson said. “Maybe a little more off the field.”/nMeanwhile, the Vikings are prepared to give Kelce his fair share of attention on the field./n“Every single snap, first, second and third down, Travis Kelce is dangerous,” Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell said. “You have to know where he is, and there’s a great chance wherever he is, the intent of the play is probably to involve him in a pretty significant capacity.”/nThe biggest thing that separates Kelce from everybody else who plays the position is his ability to freelance. A common joke around the NFL is that the 6-foot-5, 250-pound tight end sometimes doesn’t even run routes. He simply searches for an open space while running downfield./nAsked about defending Kelce over the course of a game, Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores noted that it’s imperative to keep eyes on him until the whistle blows the play dead./n“He’s certainly among the best tight ends to probably ever play,” Flores said. “”If somebody has him leveraged out, he’s going to stop the route and go somewhere else where he can get open.”/nIt helps that there’s something otherworldly about the way Mahomes goes about his business, extending plays with his legs long enough for Kelce to get open, then zipping the ball in there at the last second./n“You’ll see Trav sit in a zone and then he’ll see Patty move his feet and he’s like, ‘Alright, I’m going to go over here,’ ” Hockenson said. “He does a lot of stuff that’s just really cool to watch.”/nThere isn’t a perfect way to defend that combination. Frankly, even if the Vikings dial up the perfect call, they might still end up giving up a big play because the rapport Kelce has with Mahomes is on another level./n“It’s really hard,” Vikings safety Josh Metellus said. “We might think we have it shut down and they find a way to make an even bigger play out of nowhere.”/nIt’s important that the Vikings don’t let those plays compound on defense./n“We’ve just got to move on to the next play,” Flores said. “That’s really the mindset we’ve got to take.”/nAs somebody who plays the same position, Hockenson has tried to emulate his game after Kelce over the years./n“He’s just such a great player,” Hockenson said. “I could go off on a tangent about all the things that he does. He varies his speeds. He sees the defense. He does some stuff at the top of the route.”/nDoes he have any tips for how the defense should cover him?/n“It’s easier for me to say than it is for them to guard,” Hockenson said with a laugh. “You can kind of try to help out a little bit, but it’s not like I know exactly what Trav is doing on certain plays.”/nWhich is exactly why the Vikings will be giving Kelce so much attention on the field. As for the attention off the field, that will hinge on whether Swift shows up to cheer him on./n“That would be cool,” Vikings cornerback Byron Murphy said. “Not for him, though, because we’re going to try and get our hands on him in front of her.”/nThat might be easier said than done.",0,348,Unrelated,0

It seems like it could.,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2023/09/05/taylor-swift-might-want-to-change-up-her-promotional-plan-for-1989-taylors-version/,Forbes,general,us,2023-09-05T17:00:02+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,349,"MEXICO CITY, MEXICO - AUGUST 24: EDITORIAL USE ONLY. Taylor Swift performs onstage during the ... [+] ""Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour"" at Foro Sol on August 24, 2023 in Mexico City, Mexico. (Photo by Hector Vivas/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTaylor Swift has been releasing her re-recorded albums for nearly two years now, and there is now a tried-and-true formula she follows. The singer has been fairly consistent when it comes to the manner in which she promotes these sets, and it’s worked brilliantly. But with her forthcoming drop, she might want to reconsider how she’s been doling out the tunes and aim for more major hits./nFor the first three of her re-recorded album releases, Swift has largely—but not entirely—stayed away from promoting singles with traditional campaigns. Sometimes she’d share a tune or two before a full-length appears, but most of the music is only available once the full package hits. In less than two months, Swift will return with 1989 (Taylor’s Version), the slightly reworked take on her pop album 1989. The set is scheduled to drop in late October, which isn’t very far away, even if it feels that way to Swifties. Now would be a great time to mix things up./n1989 was Swift’s biggest album when it comes to singles. The title produced three No. 1 hits on the Hot 100, with “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space,” and “Bad Blood” all rising to the top spot. Two other cuts, “Style” and “Wildest Dreams,” also found their way into the top 10 on the tally. Many of these cuts rank among her most popular and highest-certified, having moved millions upon millions of copies./nAnticipation for the reworked versions of many of these singles is high, and Swift could capitalize on that excitement if she wanted to. Instead of dropping all those tunes at once when 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is made available as a full collection, she could share them one at a time. That plan would allow fans to rush to support each one individually, perhaps helping them perform better in their short windows of exclusivity./nSwift could potentially hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 twice with the same song but under slightly different titles. Tracks like “Shake It Off” and “Blank Space” are still performing well to this day, so if Swift pushed her massive fan base to stream and buy the retitled versions, they could also soar to the summit. She proved she could earn a No. 1 with a re-recording when “All Too Well” finally hit the top spot on the Hot 100 after being extended, renamed and re-released. So why shouldn’t the same be possible with tunes that were even more popular?/nThis plan could also work for those 1989 tunes that weren’t No. 1s in a past life. “Style” has already been surging in terms of sales and streams since Swift announced 1989 (Taylor’s Version), so perhaps that’s next in line to go to No. 1 on the Hot 100. Plenty of other cuts from the set were also fan favorites, and in their re-recorded forms, they might rise even higher than they did originally, as much has changed in the near-decade since 1989 took over the world./nIf Swift does want to produce a number of major hits, one at a time, from 1989 (Taylor’s Version), she should start soon. The set is coming in less than two months, so she wants to give each one at least a week in which to rack up enough streams and sales to conquer the Hot 100, or at least debut high before she moves on to the next. This plan could help her increase her career totals of placements inside the highest reaches of the chart, but it also comes with some downsides./nCurrently, Swift is busy trying to send her current single “Cruel Summer” to the highest rung on the Hot 100. The song is living inside the top 10, where it has remained for weeks. New tunes keep beating the cut to the summit, but there’s no telling what’s in store for the coming frames./nIf it takes another few weeks to push that electro cut to the summit, she might not want to split attention and go for another leader from 1989 (Taylor’s Version). In essence, it’s possible that the slow rise of “Cruel Summer” may stop some promotional plans around 1989 (Taylor’s Version), though there’s no telling what Swift is planning at the moment./n",4.466938898,349,Discography,1

/n/nTaylor Swift fans were forever changed when she released the song “All Too Well” on her album Red in 2012. From the moment the five-plus minute song came out, fans were instantly transported into the history of one of Taylor’s past romances. Like with most of Taylor’s songs, “All Too Well” was based on a true story from her life, but the specificities in the lyrics took things to a level that no other Taylor song had gone to before./n/n“All Too Well” [was difficult to write emotionally] because it took me a really long time to filter through everything I wanted to put in the song without it being a 10 minute song, which you can’t put on an album,” Taylor explained in 2012. “I wanted a story that could work in the form of a song and I called my co-writer LizRose and said, ‘Come over, we gotta filter this down.’ And it took me a really long time to get it.”/nTaylor first released “All Too Well” on her album Red in 2012 and it was instantly a fan favorite. “It was a day when I was just, like, a broken human, walking into rehearsal, just feeling terrible about what was going on in my personal life,” Taylor said on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums podcast in 2020. “I just started playing four chords over and over again and the band started kicking in. People just started playing along with me, I think they could tell I was really going through it. I just started singing and riffing and ab-libbing this song that basically was “All Too Well.” It literally just was that song, but it had probably seven extra verses and it included the f-word.”/nThis wasn’t the first time that it had been publicly revealed that “All Too Well” was originally much longer than the 5 minutes and 29 seconds that fans heard on Red. For years, Swifties begged Taylor to release the full, ten-minute version, and in 2021, they finally got their wish. At the end of 2020, Taylor began the process of re-recording her first six albums so she could earn the rights to the songs. In addition to re-recording all the original songs, Taylor also included previously un-released songs that didn’t make the albums the first time around. When she dropped Red (Taylor’s Version) in Nov. 2021, that included the full, 10-minute version of “All Too Well.”/n/nTaylor did this as a gift to her fans, who helped the song take on a life of its own over the years. Taylor even performed “All Too Well” at the 2014 Grammy Awards, despite the fact that it was never a single. “It’s fun when things surprise you like that,” she admitted. Taylor wrote “All Too Well” when she was in one of her most heartbroken states, but has said that the song now brings her joy because of the way her fans have reacted to it./nIn addition to dropping a 10-minute audio version of “All Too Well” in Nov. 2021, Taylor also released a short film for the song. The film stars Dylan O’Brien and Sadie Sink in the lead roles, with Taylor also popping in at the end for a surprise appearance. She performed the full 10-minute version on Saturday Night Live in an unprecedented performance, as well./nIt’s no secret that Taylor wrote “All Too Well” about her brief relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal. Even though Taylor has never explicitly said this herself, there are many, many hints that point to Jake. The very first clue was in Taylor’s album liner notes for Red. Back in the day, Taylor used to capitalize certain letters in the lyrics that were written out in the liner of her records. The capitalized letters always spelled out a hidden message that was meant to give more insight into who or what the song was about. For “All Too Well,” the liner note was “Maple Lattes.” When Taylor and Jake were dating, they were photographed carrying coffee cups while strolling around New York City, and a coffee shop employee confirmed to People at the time that they ordered specialty maple lattes during their visit to the store on Thanksgiving Day 2010./nOf course, the song was also released on the first album Taylor dropped following her breakup from Jake. Many of the songs on Red are seemingly about the handsome actor. However, “All Too Well” tells the full story of the pair’s relationship, and the 10-minute version adds even more insight./nThe very first verse of “All Too Well” references the Thanksgiving that Taylor and Jake spent together in 2010. After getting maple lattes, they spent the holiday with his sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal, in Brooklyn. “I left my scarf there, at your sister’s house and you still got it, in your drawer, even now,” Taylor sings, referencing the black scarf she was wearing that day. The “scarf” has become an important symbol for Swifties./nIn the second verse, Taylor continues, “You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,” and yes, Jake did have glasses when he was a kid — we’ve seen the photos to prove it! In the 10-minute version of “All Too Well,” Taylor gives another direct hint about Jake, singing, “You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine, and that made me want to die.” The exes have a nine-year age gap. She referenced their ages again later in the song, adding, “I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes, I get older but your lovers stay my age.” Jake’s current girlfriend, Jeanne Cadieu, is only 26 years old./nThe 10 minute version of “All Too Well” also references Brooklyn, where Taylor spent a lot of time with Jake. She also sings about the song’s subject missing her 21st birthday party, and Taylor turned 21 amidst her relationship with Jake. Another Red song, “The Moment I Knew,” is about this specific heartbreak, as well./nTaylor and Jake first dated for three months between October 2010 and January 2011. She was 20 and he was 29 when they first got together. The two were first linked when they were spotted at Saturday Night Live together in Oct. 2010. Although the two mostly kept their relationship out of the public eye, they were photographed strolling around New York City together on Thanksgiving 2010. Taylor was also seen with Jake’s sister, Maggie, on the holiday. Reports of their breakup first surfaced in Jan. 2011, with Us Weekly reporting, “Jake just told her it wasn’t working out. Taylor is really upset and hurt. She feels really burned by him.”/nHowever, the “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” lyrics reveal that Taylor and Jake tried to secretly reconnect a few months after breaking up. “You never called it what it was, ’til we were dead and gone and buried, check the pulse and come back swearin’ it’s the same, after three months in the grave,” Taylor sings on the song. Later on, she croons about how Jake didn’t want anyone to know about how they were giving things another go. “There we are again when nobody had to know, you kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath,” she reveals./nRed also featured the song “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” which is also speculated to be about Jake. The song title says it all, with the lyrics telling the story of an ex who wants to get back together time and time again — only, finally, the narrator is no longer having it. This tracks with the theory that Taylor and Jake had gotten back together before she called it off for good./nIn February 2022, Jake addressed “All Too Well” for the first time. “It has nothing to do with me,” he told Esquire. “It’s about her relationship with her fans. It is her expression. Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don’t begrudge anyone that.” Despite his level-headed response, Jake also made sure to reference the hate he’d been getting from Taylor fans over the years. “At some point, I think it’s important when supporters get unruly that we feel a responsibility to have them be civil and not allow for cyberbullying in one’s name,” he said. However, he also made it clear that his life had not been threatened by Taylor’s fans./nMeanwhile, during a 2017 interview on Watch What Happens Live, Maggie was asked if she still had Taylor’s scarf at her house. “I never understood why everybody asked me about this scarf,” Maggie admitted. “What is this?” Andy Cohen explained the situation, and Maggie still played coy. “I am in the dark about the scarf,” she said. “It’s totally possible. I don’t know. I have been asked this before.” Of course, a deeper read of the lyrics reveal that it’s JAKE who is supposed to have the scarf (in his drawer), not Maggie!/nDuring a 2013 interview, Taylor also revealed Jake’s reaction to the Red album in general. Although she didn’t name him directly in the interview, it’s widely theorized that her quote was about him, due to most of the album being about him. “He was like, ‘I just listened to the album and that was a really bittersweet experience for me. It was like going through a photo album,'” Taylor recalled. “That was nice. Nicer than, like, the ranting crazy e-mails I got from this one dude.”/n

Bianka Bryant receiving the 22 hat is the latest act of kindness that Swift has given to the Bryant daughters. In 2020 Swift sent Natalia Bryant a “folklore” cardigan. Natalia shared the cardigan on her Instagram story, adding that she was “obsessed” with the album./nBianka receiving the hat was a special moment for fans of both Swift and Kobe. The late basketball star had previously joined the popstar on stage during her 1989 tour. “Make some noise for your own Kobe Bryant” said Swift after Bryant made his way to her as she performed “Style.” Bryant went on to cut the song short so he could present Swift with a banner during her 1989 tour for the most sold out performances at the then Staples Center./nCongrats on record setting 16 sold out shows @taylorswift13! @STAPLESCenter raises a banner for you! #1989TourLA pic.twitter.com/AqvAbSvGgC/n— Crypto.com Arena (@cryptocomarena) August 22, 2015/n/nKobe Bryant presenting @taylorswift with her banner at what use to be Staples Center during 1989 World Tour.

353,,Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff celebrate 'Cruel Summer' hitting No. 1 four years after initial release,"Taylor Swift's latest milestone feels like a complete ""fever dream."" On Monday, the singer and her collaborator Jack Antonoff celebrated their co-written song ""Cruel Summer,"" from the singer's 2019 album ""Lover,"" hitting No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/entertainment/taylor-swift-cruel-summer/index.html,CNN,general,us,2023-10-24T00:15:59+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,353,"
Taylor Swift’s latest milestone feels like a complete “fever dream.” 
  /n
“Cruel Summer,” a track off of her 2019 “Lover” album, hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart this week. The music charting site reported the news on Monday, noting that it had previously peaked at No. 3. 
  /n
      The feat was cause for celebration given Swift’s self-professed “favorite” song was initially released more than four years ago and only officially became a single in June. 
  /n
      “We just wanted to say thank you so much for making ‘Cruel Summer’ a Hot 100 No. 1,” Swift gushed in a video posted to her Instagram Monday, adding, “It’s not even summer anymore – it’s deep fall, I’m wearing a sweater. We love you guys!” 
  /n
      Jack Antonoff, a frequent collaborator and co-writer on the song, appeared in the video with Swift and said they felt that “Cruel Summer” was the “best song” on the album. 
  /n
      “But we thought, oh, you know what? This is our secret best song, that’s what we thought,” he said, adding, “It really means the world.” 
  /n
      Swift opens her 44-song “Eras Tour” setlist with “Cruel Summer,” which has increased the pop anthem’s popularity since she kicked off the tour in March. 
  /n
      “That song was my pride and joy,” she told her Pittsburgh audience in June, going on to say that her label decided to “make it my next single” at the time because so many people had been streaming it. 
  /n
      In another not-so-cruel milestone, Billboard also reported on Monday that Swift is now ranked tenth on an “elite” list of artists with ten or more No. 1 songs on the Hot 100 chart.

He called it a “life-changing” amount of money that far exceeds the standard bonus his truckers usually get./n“The typical amount is $5,000 to $10,000 each. So this large amount is unbelievable,” he told CNN./nHe said his drivers were shocked when they read the amount on their cheques, adding that this kind of money could help his employees put down payments on houses or set up college funds for their kids./n“Look, fair wage doesn’t put you in a position to buy a home. But this opens up that possibility,” Scherkenbach said./nThe bonuses were handed out during what was supposed to be a routine meeting ahead of one of Swift’s L.A. shows. Scherkenbach said he was going over the rundown for the week when Swift’s father, Scott Swift, made a surprise visit./n“Scott gave a speech saying that he had discussed this with Taylor and they thought that it was only right that everybody received a bonus. Taylor insisted on writing a handwritten note to each driver and (added) a wax seal on the envelope with her monogram,” he recounted./n“The drivers didn’t want to be overly rude and look at it. But one looked and thought it said $1,000, another driver saw it as $10,000 and then the third said ‘Well this has to be a joke!’” Scherkenbach said./nBut the US$100,000 bonus was no joke, and each cheque and thank you note came with a corresponding tax document./nWhile the bonus may seem outsized, so, too, are the sacrifices that Scherkenbach’s truckers made to work this job./n“These men and women, they live on the road. They sleep during the day and work all night,” he said. “It’s a gruelling task. They leave their families, young children for weeks. For Taylor’s tour, they’ve been away from home for 24 weeks.”/nBut the force of Swift’s dollars haven’t just been felt by workers, but also the locations to which she’s brought the Eras tour./n“At this point, Taylor Swift is basically her own economy,” as one Vanity Fair writer puts it./nThe impacts of her tour have been felt in every city she has stopped at, selling out stadiums, gracing fans with a 44-song set list spanning her nearly two-decade-long career and injecting millions of dollars into local economies with the gravity of her star power./nIn a Federal Reserve report published in July, the agency found that “May was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the onset of the pandemic, in large part due to an influx of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the city.”/nPerforming just two shows in Colorado led to a US$140-million boost to the state’s GDP for the year, according to a report from the Common Sense Institute./n“The totality of Taylor Swift’s U.S. tour could generate $4.6 billion in total consumer spending, larger than the GDP of 35 countries,” the report states./nGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing national stories delivered to your inbox every weekday./nGet a roundup of the most important and intriguing national stories delivered to your inbox every weekday.",13.2849928,354,Tour,1

/nNPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Mia Galuppo of The Hollywood Reporter about how Taylor Swift's concert film, The Eras Tour, has reignited interest in concert films from studios and musicians alike./nAILSA CHANG, HOST:  It is the highest-grossing concert tour of 2023.(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""TAYLOR SWIFT: THE ERAS TOUR"")TAYLOR SWIFT: Welcome to the Eras Tour.(APPLAUSE)CHANG: Taylor Swift's massive global tour is still going, and she's on track to break Elton John's record for the highest-grossing tour of all time.(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""TAYLOR SWIFT: THE ERAS TOUR"")SWIFT: (Singing) I love you. Ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?CHANG: But you know another thing bringing in megabucks for Swift? The nearly three-hour-long concert film of her tour out last month. It's already grossed more than $200 million worldwide. Hollywood studios and musicians - oh, you bet they are paying attention. Mia Galuppo wrote about it for The Hollywood Reporter.MIA GALUPPO: It's a situation where there's a lot of money to be had. It's a space that hasn't really been looked into much by artists because it hasn't really been embraced by exhibitors, by Hollywood. But as with anything, where Taylor Swift goes, many people follow. So as soon as people started seeing the success that Swift had, people have started paying attention.CHANG: Well, Beyonce is going to be coming out with her own concert film next month, right? So I'm just thinking, yeah, OK. She is also a huge global economic force like Taylor Swift. I guess my question is, is there even space for smaller or lesser-known artists to come out with concert films, or do you have to be a mega-huge star to draw people out to theaters?GALUPPO: No, you don't have to be, you know, this Beyonce- or Taylor Swift-level star, which, you know, are two of the top recording artists of all time. I was talking to the head of the National Association of Theater Owners. He made a great comparison where, just as at the summer box office, you see the blockbusters, you know, the Marvels of the world, you also see those independent films that still make a lot of money.CHANG: Well, what about artists who are no longer alive? Like, I noticed you wrote in your piece there might be a 1970s David Bowie concert film coming to theaters soon. How big of a draw is archival stuff like that these days?GALUPPO: A really interesting thing happened recently with the film ""Stop Making Sense,"" which is the Talking Heads film that was recently rereleased by A24. Sixty percent of that opening weekend audience was actually under the age of 35, which means that the majority of that audience that was going to see that film wasn't even born when the Talking Heads were a band. They had disbanded by that point. So it's really fascinating. And that movie did incredibly well at the box office. So there is this market there which exhibitors are trying to say, please make more of this type of film because audiences, as evidenced by something like ""Stop Making Sense"" or Taylor Swift...CHANG: Yeah.GALUPPO: ...Are going to show up to the theaters.CHANG: But are these new concert films that are coming out more of the same? - because, I mean, way before Taylor, there was already a pretty large canon of concert films, from Aretha Franklin to Led Zeppelin, from Prince to the Talking Heads, as you mentioned. Is there anything that sets Taylor Swift's film apart that maybe would signal a new direction for this whole genre?GALUPPO: Yes, definitely. One of my sources who has been in the concert and live performance film space for a long while said a very interesting thing, which was concert films were ruined by poor execution. The technology just wasn't there. It was a situation where you set up three cameras. You were looking at the stage. And that's not a very cinematic experience.CHANG: Yeah.GALUPPO: For ""The Eras Tour,"" which filmed over multiple nights at her SoFi Stadium tour here in Los Angeles, it employed a small armada of cameras and cameramen.CHANG: How many are we talking?GALUPPO: We are talking upwards of 40, according to reports.CHANG: Wow.GALUPPO: And this is including not just stationary cameras but drones and cranes. You know, this is a situation where the barrier to entry for that technology has lowered for artists, and you are able to create an incredibly cinematic experience. And that is something...CHANG: Yeah.GALUPPO: ...That - you know, when I was there for the opening weekend of ""The Eras Tour"" in theaters, that's something that, you know, fellow moviegoers told me was so exciting to them - is it was the closest thing to being there without being there.

It seems unlikely, but there’s a real chance that “IDGAF” could replace “First Person Shooter” on the Hot 100’s throne, making Drake one of a very small number of acts in U.S. history to swap one winner for another./nDoja Cat could also possibly return to the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 with her single “Paint the Town Red.” The tune has already spent several weeks running the show, and it’s the highest-ranking non-Drake smash on the Hot 100. This week, it’s been pushed down to No. 4, so it doesn’t have far to climb once Drake’s For All The Dogs songs descend…if they do descend, that is./nSZA is also looking to snag her third No. 1 hit with “Snooze.” The latest single from her album SOS has come tantalizingly close to the highest rung on the tally, as it’s topped out at No. 2, where it ranked last frame. Once Drake’s new hits step out of the way, as many are expected to after this week, SZA will have another real shot at claiming another champion. Even if “Snooze” doesn’t make it to No. 1 next turn, it’s still one to watch./n",-10.02626225,359,Achievements,0

				Jack Antonoff and Margaret Qualley had one very special guest at their Aug. 19 wedding -- the one and only Taylor Swift!			/n
Breaking News
/n/nTaylor Swift was spotted in Long Beach Island, New Jersey on Aug. 19 as a guest at her longtime friend and collaborator, Jack Antonoff’s, wedding. Jack married Margaret Qualley in an intimate ceremony, and Taylor was in attendance to support the happy couple. The 33-year-old was spotted exiting a large white Chevy SUV as she headed into the wedding through a back door, following a suited security guard in video published by Page Six. A glimpse of her baby blue midi-length dress by Erdem could be seen, revealing a spaghetti strap cut and ruffle details, along with a slightly asymmetrical skirt. She kept her hair down and draped over one shoulder as she walked in, also showing off a high pair of stiletto sandals./nIn another, second video published by the outlet, Taylor could also be seen walking with a glass of white wine outside next to pals (and couple) Zoe Kravitz and Channing Tatum./nAfter more than 10 years of a friendship and working relationship, Taylor and Jack have formed an incredibly close bond over the years. The two first met in 2012 and collaborated for the first time on the song “Sweeter Than Fiction” in 2013. The song was featured on the One Chance movie soundtrack. Following its release, Taylor began working on her fifth studio album, 1989, and tapped Jack as a producer for the project./nJack co-wrote and produced three songs — “Out Of The Woods, “I Wish You Would” and “You Are In Love” — on the record. At the time, he was in a relationship with Lena Dunham, and Taylor penned “You Are In Love” about their relationship. The two broke up in 2018 and Jack started dating Margaret in 2021./nIn 2016, Jack was by Taylor’s side when she took home Album of the Year for 1989 at the Grammys. He joined her again for her 2017 album Reputation, helping with six tracks on the record. Jack has also collaborated with Taylor on her subsequent albums Lover, Folklore (which also won a Grammy for Album of the Year), Evermore and Midnights. Additionally, he was part of the re-recording process for Fearless (Taylor’s Version), Red (Taylor’s Version) and Speak Now (Taylor’s Version). It’s likely that he was also involved in 1989 (Taylor’s Version), which will come out later this year./nWhen Taylor released Midnights in 2022, she wrote an Instagram post about how much it meant to her that she and Jack were still working together after 10 years of friendship. “I couldn’t be happier that my co-pilot on this adventure was Jack Antonoff,” she gushed. “He’s my friend for life (presumptuous I know but I stand by it) and we’ve been making music together for nearly a decade HOWEVER..this is our first album we’ve done with just the two of us as main collaborators.”/n

Madison Avenue, the NFL and Swift’s staff must be staying up late each night coming up with ways to exploit this thing for all it’s worth while it lasts, and apparently they convinced the football gods to play along. Just when we thought that Zach Wilson and the Jets might actually spoil the plot Sunday night, the Chiefs and Kelce pulled out a win./nMemo to Wilson: Shake It Off./nThe NFL is just glad to be in the news for something that isn’t straight from a police blotter or drawing the public’s wrath. After Deshaun Watson and the gambling suspensions and the anthem kneeling and Kaepernick and the wokeness we get, awwww, cute — the football player and Miss Americana. Kelce has caught the Tay-Bug. How Enchanted. (I hope you appreciate that someone of advanced years managed to pull off allusions to two Taylor Swift songs in one paragraph.)/nHere’s what I think went down when Swift and Kelce went public. Swift met with Roger Goodell at a secret location and laid it out for him: “Here’s the deal, Commish: I’ll bring millions of Swifties to the NFL — a demographic consisting of females ages 5 to 35 — and you’ll give me the male NFL audience, plus I’ll get a new song out of it five minutes after the breakup. Meanwhile, we can sell a lot of jerseys and insurance, too.”/nTo which Goodell replied, “Where do I sign?”/nTay Tay is a pop singing sensation of course, but that’s not her greatest talent. Many years ago I participated in an interview with rock legend (and Swift’s namesake) James Taylor, and for some reason someone asked him what he thought of Swift (what?!). Taylor paused a moment and then said, “She’s a marketing genius.”/nIf Tay Tay is not collaborating musically with James Taylor or Ed Sheeran or John Mayer or Colbie Caillat or Chris Stapleton or the group formally known as The Dixie Chicks or Keith Urban and many many more — mining new audiences across all genres and eras — she’s dating them, breaking up with them and writing a song about them — Joe Jonas, Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Lucas Till, Taylor Lautner, Conor Kennedy, Harry Styles (there were many more listed on the internet, but I lost interest). Now it’s Kelce (and, by extension, the NFL)./nTay Tay is a force of nature. You think Kelce is a big deal, sports fans? He’s not even in her league. If she were North America, he would be Guam. She can fill football stadiums all by herself (like the Beatles). Let’s see a tight end do that. Maybe no one since the Fab Four has connected with the masses like this woman. Tay Tay could climb to the top of a remote mountain in Peru and run into a Swiftie. She is ubiquitous, appearing in commercials, taking the continent by storm with her ongoing Eras Tour (68 shows this year, ticket sales expected to surpass $2 billion), cooperating for a documentary, smiling her red lipstick on magazine covers everywhere, receiving nonstop media coverage, selling 114 billion albums … and now she’s cracked the NFL market. Heaven help us./nThe last two weekends she showed up in NFL suites cheering on her flame with the Kelce family and friends (what, no Matthew McConaughey!?). She got more airtime than Andy Reid during Sunday night’s Jets-Chiefs game at MetLife Stadium. There was Tay Tay with her arm around Mama Kelce. And there was — what?! — Jake from State Farm chatting up Mama K, too. During a commercial break, we saw a bank ad featuring — who else? — Taylor Swift, followed immediately by another commercial featuring Chiefs coach Andy Reid, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and our buddy Jake, pitching insurance./nTay-Trav has created the nexus of pop, football and Madison Avenue. Tay Tay couldn’t possibly be more popular so we won’t go there, but internet searches for Kelce’s jersey have increased by 1,267% and searches for Chiefs jerseys and tickets have risen by 1,974% and 1,853% in a week, respectively. The demand for Kelce’s jersey has surpassed that of Mahomes, famous quarterback and pitchman. By the way, Tay-Trav happened just in time to boost attention for the documentary about Kelce, soon to be released./n(If nothing else, this has been a mutually beneficial relationship. Almost makes you wonder if it was, like, you know, totally planned, the latest genius marketing move by Tay?)/nIf (when?) Kelce and Tay Tay split up, Goodell and the insurance people will cry their eyes out. They knew that was the risk All Too Well (get it? — another Swiftie song! We media types have done a crash course in Swift songs so we can sound hip and clever). The Swifties and NFL fans will be watching to see if Kelce joins a long trail littered with the singer’s former beaus.

Bey has been performing at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood these past couple nights -- which is a go-to stop for big touring artists these days ... and one that TayTay also performed at just a few weeks ago to cap off her U.S. leg of the Eras Tour./nWaiting for your permission to load TikTok Post./nFolks who went to both SoFi concerts (Bey's and Taylor's, that is) are walking away with an interesting comparison ... namely, the monitor system. Based on some of these posts, it appears some felt Bey might've cut a few corners in the display ... whereas Taylor didn't./nWhat they're referring to is SoFi' 360-degree, circular videoboard -- which hangs suspended in the middle of the facility and which has massive LED screens all around it (inside and out) ... so that people in the nosebleeds can watch whatever action is going on down below./nWaiting for your permission to load TikTok Post./nTake a look at these videos people are posting juxtaposing the performances ... they're pointing out Taylor had that circular videoboard on the entire time, and that each screen was turned on as well. In Beyonce's case, it appears only one monitor on the videoboard was on ... and the rest of them were turned off. In other words, ticket buyers who were further out had to rely on just a couple of giant monitors on Beyonce's main stage./nSome of these Beyonce clips are a little cringeworthy ... 'cause people from certain angles legitimately couldn't witness much at all -- other than tiny specks down on the ground./nAnd yet, for the Taylor Swift crowd ... even the people who were furthest away seemed to have had a great view of the performance, all because that circular videoboard was turned on./nNow, there's been some speculation as to why this was the case for one and not the other ... and it all has to do with what some claim is SoFi actually charging artists/their touring companies to run and operate those monitors -- and, presumably, it isn't all that cheap./nWe haven't been able to find any definitive evidence that SoFi even charges for this feature, or that the alleged cost is passed on to the artist -- but if that is the case, it's interesting./nThe bigger picture here is that Swifties and Beyhivers continue to be at odds over which star is doing the touring thing better right now, but we won't weigh into all that. No thanks!/nOne last thing ... Chart Data claimed this past week that Beyonce's Renaissance tour had broken a record by becoming the highest-grossing tour by a solo female artist since Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour, raking in $461 million so far. What that report fails to acknowledge, strangely, is that Taylor's Eras Tour has been projected to be in the billions./nIf true, it's unclear how Bey can hold that title ... especially since they're both still going.",3.057997905,367,Unrelated,1

Self-interested hotel union Unite Here Local 11./nFor related news, see: Politicians urge Taylor Swift to postpone LA concerts in solidarity with striking hotel workers/nIn a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times, the union called on Swift to postpone her show in “solidarity” with striking hotel workers. Several of the union’s elected allies have predictably chimed in, arguing that Swift should respect the union’s cause. Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis was shameless enough to join the protest, despite having just seen Swift in Santa Clara the weekend prior./nNotably missing from the list of boycott endorsers: Inglewood Mayor James Butts, not to mention the countless small businesses and disappointed fans who would lose out if Swift skipped SoFi./nThe union’s demand is an unusual one: Swift herself is not in the middle of a labor dispute. Indeed, Swift made news in recent days by awarding her road crew up to $100,000 each as a personal thank you for the hard work during the tour. She’s also partnered with local charitable organizations on her tour stops, such as a food bank in Santa Clara./nFor related news, see: Hahn, Kounalakis urge Swift to call off SoFi concerts in support of striking hotel workers/nIt’s hard to imagine a more pro-worker perspective, and seemingly one that Los Angeles would welcome to town./nBut according to Local 11’s twisted logic, Swift is obligated to reschedule because her visiting fans will be staying at LA-area hotels, including some of the hotels where workers may currently be on strike. This selfish perspective is on-brand for Local 11, which in recent weeks has made news for deliberately disrupting a wedding and 4th of July tourism to advance its goals during the strike./nRelated Articles

Set aside for a minute the flawed argument that the entire LA economy should suffer because of labor disputes at a handful of union properties. The fault for the ongoing strike lies with union leadership, not the hotels and certainly not the excited Taylor fans coming to Los Angeles. The union has stubbornly prolonged the dispute with demands that hotels support a Los Angeles ballot measure that would require them to house the homeless alongside paying guests./nWith a potential transformation of these hotels into makeshift homeless shelters, good luck getting tourists to stay there for Taylor’s next tour stop in Los Angeles./nFor related news, see: Eleni Kounalakis hypocritically calls for Taylor Swift to cancel shows after attending concert/nAlso on the list of demands is a new hotel tax of seven percent, which guests would pay into a trust fund controlled by the union. The union claims the money would go towards affordable housing, but the language of the fund gives it broad latitude to spend the money on “other efforts” as well./nAs of this writing, Swift seems poised to ignore the union’s unreasonable demands, picking the local economy and thousands of fans over the tantrums of Kurt Peterson and his cronies at Local 11. The tour dates will no doubt be a success, and should also serve as a lesson to other celebrities and politicians who face a Local 11 call for a boycott: There’s no harm in shaking off the unreasonable demands of Los Angeles labor unions./nMichael Saltsman is Executive Director at the Employment Policies Institute",-18.99651676,368,Tour,1

[+] Monday, Aug. 7, 2023.  (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)/nTaylor Swift's 1989 (Taylor's Version) is rewriting the record books once again, this time on the vinyl front. The re-recorded version of her pop masterpiece 1989, released just a week ago, has broken the all-time record for the largest sales week on vinyl in U.S. history./nAccording to Billboard, which cites data from Luminate, 1989 (Taylor's Version) achieved the remarkable feat of selling 580,000 copies on vinyl in its first six days of availability. That’s the largest sales week for a vinyl album since Luminate began tracking sales in 1991./nThe previous modern-era vinyl sales record was previously held by Swift, so the singer-songwriter breaks her own record. Before the arrival of 1989 (Taylor's Version), that honor was held by her most recent album of all original material, Midnights. The set sold 575,000 copies in its opening week in late October 2022./nWhat may be even more impressive is that 1989 (Taylor's Version)’s total first-week sales sum isn’t clear just yet. The numbers reported are only as of the first six days the title was available. That 580,000 sum will likely climb, raising the record even higher./nIn the first six days following its release, 1989 (Taylor's Version) sold over 1.1 million copies in the United States alone, including all formats. When considering total equivalent album units earned—including streaming activity as well—that figure climbs to over 1.3 million copies./nOne of the factors contributing to her incredible vinyl success was the variety of vinyl variants offered for 1989 (Taylor's Version). Buyers had the option to choose from several different colors, and it’s likely that many dedicated supporters purchased multiple copies, further bolstering the impressive sales figures./nWith the album's extraordinary sales performance, Swift is poised to score yet another No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. It's virtually guaranteed that 1989 (Taylor's Version) will debut at the top, as it has already moved over one million copies—something almost no one left in the music industry can manage these days. The title will mark her thirteenth chart-topping album, the third-most of all time./n",1.129509024,369,Achievements,1

Her ability to tantalize fans with teasers and hidden clues has ignited speculation about her next move–including a potential new single from her recent acclaimed release./nAs Swift takes center stage during her residence at Los Angeles's iconic SoFi Stadium, the venue’s official Twitter account extended a warm virtual embrace to the megastar with a series of images. While these visuals depict picturesque California landscapes, it's the subtle details that have ignited a wildfire of speculation among ardent fans./nAmong the images is a depiction of Beverly Hills, complete with an intriguing alteration. A street sign bearing the name ""Bejeweled Drive"" is the focus of the scene. A quick glance at Google Maps reveals that no such thoroughfare exists in Beverly Hills, so it’s not only made up, it’s been concocted for a reason./nSwift's penchant for embedding Easter eggs within her artistry is widely known, and this conspicuous clue has sparked fervent deductions from her devoted followers. It can’t mean nothing. The singer has taught her followers that everything means something./n""Bejeweled” is one of the songs featured on Swift’s album Midnights, her latest collection of original compositions. The set acme a blockbuster the moment it arrived in late 2022, and since then, it has maintained its status as a bestseller and hit-producer./nMidnights has already produced three singles, with the most recent offering, ""Karma,"" officially receiving the treatment in early May. It’s been months since then, and the Ice Spice-assisted cut is on its way down, so now’s a good time for a new focus. ""Bejeweled"" stands as a strong contender, backed by its status as a fan favorite and its inclusion in her The Eras Tour setlist./nAs Midnights started at the pinnacle of the Billboard 200, ""Bejeweled"" promptly debuted within the top 10 on the Hot 100. It has so far peaked at No. 6 on the tally, and when the CD launched, it was one of 10 top 10 smashes from the set, as Swift ruled the entire highest tier on the ranking at once, a historic first./nAlso embedded within SoFi Stadium's tantalizing tweet were other additional hints. Another image subtly suggested the potential next title in her re-recording plan, 1989 (Taylor's Version). While these breadcrumbs fuel anticipation and plenty of social chatter, Swift's mysterious nature means nothing is certain until she announces it officially./n",1.081059085,371,Discography,0

Swift had endured weeks of the NFL sports media, abetted by Kelce’s public statements about having a crush on her, building up to the big moment when he was able to snag a date with “the hottest girl in school” by just being persistent enough, the writer said./nIn the end, the world may never know whether the romance is real or hype, but one thing is likely. Swift looks happy to fuel the story that she and Kelce are in the preliminary stages of something — a friendship, a professional collaboration or even an authentic romance./n“Taylor is not seen unless she wants to be seen,” PR exert Melissa DiGianfilippo, president of Serendip Consulting in Phoenix, told the Today show. “She doesn’t comment unless she wants to be heard. She (was at the game) to support him. That’s admittance enough (of) interest at the very least, or a deeper relationship.”/nDiGianfilippo pointed out that celebrities of Swift and Kelce’s caliber always have ways of being introduced privately to romantic prospects and to conduct these budding relationships out of the public eye. This reality is in contrast to the idea that celebrities’ private lives always are prey to the intrusion of the paparazzi. Indeed, Swift managed to maintain privacy around her romance with actor Joe Alwyn, and she was never spotted publicly with her last rumored boyfriend, provocative rocker Matty Healy./nSwift has been famously vocal about how much she dislikes it when people speculate on her dating life and turn it into “a national pastime” and “entertainment,” as she told Rolling Stone in 2014./nSwift most definitely does not like being known for the men she is dating and has “written multiple albums” about how relationships are better when they’re kept secret, writer Frankie de la Cretaz wrote on CNN. This writer said that the deluge of podcasts, social media posts and in-game references to Swift’s potential relationship with the Chiefs’ tight end “seems to completely disrespect her wishes and boundaries.”/nOn the other hand, Swift appeared to willingly show up at the Chiefs-Bears game and to be seen leaving the stadium with Kelce, giving fans the “entertainment” she expects they desire. Swift has become on of the most media savvy celebrities on the planet, so it’s very likely that her appearance at the game was her way of seizing control of a narrative that began spinning over the summer. That her purpose remains a mystery should fuel people’s fascination even more./nThe romance story heated up in late July after Kelce told his brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, on their “New Heights” podcast, that he tried to meet the singer at one of her Eras Tours concerts, ESPN reported./n“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings,” Kelce told his brother. He said he wanted to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it./nThe dating rumors amped up even more when Jason Kelce joked during a Sept. 14 interview on “Thursday Night Football” postgame show that the rumors of his brother’s relationship with Swift are “100 percent true.” Even after Jason Kelce emphasized that he was joking, “everything changed.” ESPN said./nAnother PR expert, Beth Booker, told Today that Swift’s appearance with Kelce has already benefited both their brands, even if the singer can’t get any more popular than she already is. At the very least, the Swift-Kelce show on Sunday boosted sales of Kelce jerseys, with the Associated Press reporting that they are “selling like hotcakes” after Sunday’s game./nDiGianfilippo agreed that there were elements of “intentionality” of the Swift-Kelce show. It was no accident that Swift sat next to Kelce’s mother, or that Kelce wore a tie-dye suit while leaving the stadium with her; his outfit was interpreted to be a riff on Swift’s “1989” album./nRelated Articles

It’s real, but they made it better and more interesting.”/nDiGianfilippo said aspects of Swift’s appearance also seem to be “in conversation” with elements of her work, including her choice to wear her signature red lipstick, as she has throughout her Eras Tour, and she and Kelce leaving in “a getaway car.” Swift has always been known to communicate with her fans with “Easter eggs” in her lyrics or in what she says or does during her public appearances./nPut together, DiGianfilippo said these clues indicate Swift is on board with the relationship, or at least with being seen with Kelce. Swift seems to be “in control” of how this narrative is now unfolding, she said./n“She only does these things when it’s something that she’s excited about or that she’s in control of.

Report
/n/nTaylor Swift, 33, has been enjoying life on the stage and in Travis Kelce‘s arms these days, but what will her Thanksgiving holiday look like? Originally, the singer was supposed to head back to the U.S. to spend the big day at home with her family right after her upcoming Eras Tour show in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on November 19, according to Page Six. However, the outlet is now reporting that she is seemingly staying in Brazil after a fan tragically died at one of her concerts./n“The Brazil concerts … She is devastated about a fan dying,” a source told the outlet. “The weather is extreme. It’s a mess she didn’t expect. It’s been a traumatic experience. It’s been a lot. She is going to decide today.” The outlet also reported that her private jet was seen landing in São Paulo on November 21./nHer new Kansas City Chiefs player beau later confirmed that he will be on his own for the holiday while speaking with brother Jason Kelce on their “New Heights” podcast. Travis noted that he will “be feasting on KFC because I won’t have anybody here.”/nTaylor has another show in São Paulo on November 24, the day after Thanksgiving, while Travis is set to play a Chiefs game in Las Vegas on November 26. The busy post-holiday week will most likely prevent them from seeing each other for at least a few days, but they could be right back in each other’s arms as soon as possible./nTravis showed up to one of Taylor’s Argentina Eras Tour shows over the weekend and seemed to thoroughly enjoy the show as he hung out with her dad, Scott Swift, in the VIP area of the venue. The talented songwriter surprised the crowd when she referenced the NFL star by changing a lyric in the song “Karma” from her Midnights album. “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me,” she sang to a blushing and smiling Travis./nThe lovebirds, who first sparked dating rumors over the summer, also made headlines right after the show when Taylor ran up to Travis, who was patiently waiting for her at the side of the stage, and planted a big kiss on him. The sweet couple then walked backstage as many fans cheered. Videos of the memorable moment made their way online and left many supporters gushing over the PDA.",-1.630365229,377,Dating,1
378,Lindsay Zoladz,Taylor Swift’s ‘“Slut!”’ and the Evolution of a Pop Star Feminist,The bonus track from “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” revisits a moment when she was carefully calibrating her public transition into adulthood and superstardom.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/arts/music/taylor-swift-1989-from-the-vault-slut.html,The New York Times,entertainment,us,2023-10-27T14:30:40+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,378,"Advertisement/nSupported by/nCritic’s Notebook/nThe bonus track from “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” revisits a moment when she was carefully calibrating her public transition into adulthood and superstardom./nBy Lindsay Zoladz/nA few weeks ago, when Taylor Swift revealed the names of the “From the Vault” bonus tracks that would appear on the rereleased “Taylor’s Version” of her blockbuster 2014 album “1989,” one title stood out, encased in quotations and emphasized with an exclamation mark: “‘Slut!’”/nThat barbed, loaded word is one that Swift has never before used in a song, and it would have been a shock to hear her sing it in the “1989” era, when she was a 24-year-old former teen star carefully calibrating her public transition into adulthood and pop superstardom. Like every Swift album before and since, “1989” was scrutinized for the slightest hints of sexuality and perceived moral transgression; save for the errant “damn” and “hell,” it was deemed sufficiently — almost suspiciously, her critics thought, for a woman her age — clean./nOn a few moments of “1989,” Swift gestured toward the public fascination with her love life (the “long list of ex-lovers” on “Blank Space”; the accusation in “Shake It Off,” that she goes “on too many dates”). But she kept her language safely PG, and kept her anger, if she had any over the way she was portrayed in the media, buried beneath the surface./nNow in her mid-30s, Swift is revisiting the album that made her a global phenomenon, and with it those five previously unreleased, newly recorded vault tracks. Sonically, they’re more in line with “Midnights,” her moody, verbose 2022 album, than the taut, sparkling pop of “1989.” The standouts are two sharply written, synth-driven relationship post-mortems: the surging “Is It Over Now?” and, even better, the pulsating “Now That We Don’t Talk,” where Swift sizes up an ex with sharp lines like, “I don’t have to pretend that I like acid rock, or that I’d like to be on a mega yacht/With important men who think important thoughts.”/nAnd then there’s “‘Slut!’” Those expecting Swift to go full riot grrrl — like the Bikini Kill frontwoman Kathleen Hanna, who would sometimes perform with that word provocatively scrawled on her stomach — probably shouldn’t have judged a song by its title. “‘Slut!’” is a dreamy, mid-tempo reverie that combines florid, rainbow-hued imagery (“Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard”) with moments of casual social commentary (“I’ll pay the price,” she says to a man of their tryst, “you won’t”). That titular syllable is exhaled breathily on the chorus and later, as the song’s intensity builds, shouted like a slur from the cheap seats. “If they call me a slut,” she sings, in a love-struck, lavender haze, “you know it might be worth it for once.”/nThat lyric feels flippant, even half-baked. Though the song is self-aware and occasionally insightful about the double standard Swift experienced as a young woman in the public eye, its edge is blunted by the way it centers the salvation of romance, as if the affection of a decent man — “In a world of boys,” Swift swoons, “he’s a gentleman” — can rescue a woman from the systemic scrutiny of sexism./nBut it’s also important to remember where, in 2014, Swift was in her evolution. After distancing herself from the word “feminist” as late as 2012, she had only recently begun identifying as one, thanks in part, she said at the time, to conversations with her friend Lena Dunham. Two years later, when she shot a video for Vogue’s “73 Questions” series, Swift was asked what advice she had for her younger self. “If I could talk to myself at 19, I would say, ‘Hey, you’re gonna date just like a normal 20-something should be allowed to do, but you’re going to be a national lightning rod for slut-shaming.’”/n“Slut” was generally the subtext of the way Swift was talked about then, though it was rarely a term hurled explicitly in her direction. Her whiteness protected her from certain kinds of scrutiny — contrast the perception of Swift with that of Amber Rose, who in 2015 organized her own version of a “SlutWalk” protest in solidarity with survivors of sexual assault — and she also seemed to have been censoring parts of herself to appeal to the widest possible audience. “Shake It Off” may have hinted at the effects of “slut-shaming,” but it was still wholesome enough to appear on the soundtrack of the 2016 animated children’s movie “Sing,” in which it was performed by an anthropomorphic pig voiced by Reese Witherspoon./n“‘Slut!’” is not a great Taylor Swift song, though it is an interesting one. Given that her more recent work has come to critique and revise the fairy tale stories her music once told, I don’t think it’s a song she would have written today. But I prefer it to the “Taylor’s Version” of her 2010 song “Better Than Revenge,” in which a line that was perceived as Swift’s own “slut-shaming” of another woman was replaced with a more benign lyric. For all its messiness, this track feels like a more honest snapshot of who she was at a certain moment in time — a young woman, wielding words, still figuring it all out./nAdvertisement",-33.39384673,378,Discography,0

(Photo by John Shearer/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nTaylor Swift has once again shocked her fans by extending her highly acclaimed The Eras Tour. The singer-songwriter has taken her tour to new lengths—and places—by announcing more than a dozen additional shows, bringing the biggest tour in memory to eager audiences across the United States and Canada./nOn Thursday, August 3, Swift surprised her devoted followers with the news of 15 new concerts added to The Eras Tour lineup by posting about it on social media. These added shows include Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis. Swift is set to perform three shows in a row in each city, ensuring that her fans have ample opportunities to see her live./nOne of the most exciting developments revealed today is Swift's decision to take The Eras Tour to Canadian soil for the first time. Swift is breaking new ground by including Toronto in her tour itinerary. To make up for her early absence, she is going above and beyond by treating Canadian fans to an incredible six consecutive shows in the major metropolitan area./nWhile Swifties around the world are undoubtedly overjoyed by this news, they will need to exercise patience as they await the arrival of these eagerly anticipated concerts. The newly added shows are scheduled to take place in October and November of 2024. Registration to learn more and gain early access to ticket purchasing is now open on Swift's official website./nThe inclusion of Canadian stops on The Eras Tour comes as a relief to none other than Canada's Prime Minister. Just last month, he reached out to Swift via social media, expressing his country's desire to host her on the tour. In a tweet, he playfully referenced Swift's own lyrics, saying, ""It’s me, hi. I know places in Canada would love to have you. So, don’t make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon.""/n",0,379,Tour,0

[+] Center on August 26, 2019 in Newark, New Jersey. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for MTV)/nFour years after it was initially released, Taylor Swift's song “Cruel Summer” is proving to be one of the biggest hits of her career. The track, which was chosen as the most unlikely of singles, has been dominating Billboard's Pop Airplay chart for months, and at the moment it shows no sign of stopping. Now, with another week spent at the top, the cut makes history and helps Swift prove once again that she ranks among the most successful women in music history./n“Cruel Summer” has now led the charge on the Pop Airplay chart for 10 weeks. Billboard publishes the ranking every week and it lists the most successful tracks at pop radio stations across the U.S. Now that it has collected 10 weeks at No. 1, “Cruel Summer” ranks as one of the longest-charting leaders of all time by a solo female musician./nIn fact, Swift is now tied with four other solo women for the fifth-most weeks spent at No. 1 on the Pop Airplay chart. She is currently on the same level as Dionne Farris (“I Know”), Mariah Carey (""We Belong Together"") and Miley Cyrus (“Flowers”), who joined this list earlier this year./nThree solo female musicians have managed to keep a song at No. 1 on the Pop Airplay chart for more than 10 weeks—but not much longer. Mariah Carey (""One Sweet Day"" with Boyz II Men), Natalie Imbruglia (“Torn”), and Halsey (“Closer” with The Chainsmokers) all saw one of their smashes spend 11 frames atop the highly competitive tally./nWhen taking into account all musical acts that include women, the ranking changes slightly. Currently, the longest running No. 1 single of all time on the Pop Airplay chart is Ace of Base’s 1994 smash hit “The Sign.” That track held on for 14 weeks./nEarlier this year, “Cruel Summer” helped Swift make history in another way on the same ranking. The track became her twelfth leader on the Pop Airplay chart, and when it hit the peak position, she officially broke her tie with several other stars and became the musician with the most No. 1 songs of all time. Before “Cruel Summer” peaked, Swift was tied with Rihanna, Katy Perry and Maroon 5, who are all steady with their 11 chart-toppers./nRadio has been instrumental in the ongoing success of “Cruel Summer.” While the track was initially a fan favorite from her 2019 album Lover, it returned to prominence after Swift began performing it on her The Eras Tour. The track quickly began streaming well, and Swift and her label released it as in a single to catch the wave. Now it looks like the tune is about to become her milestone tenth No. 1 on the Hot 100, with radio being largely responsible for the tune's continued success./n",6.271729401,380,Achievements,1

The singer-songwriter's concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, has taken the global box office by storm, and even acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan is singing her praises./nNolan, a highly regarded director and a likely Oscar nominee in a few weeks, recently shared his admiration for Taylor Swift and the impact she's making in the entertainment industry. During an event promoting his film Oppenheimer, Nolan couldn't help but commend the singer for her unique approach to distributing her concert film./n""Taylor Swift is about to show the studios,"" Nolan declared, adding, “her concert film is not being distributed by the studios, it’s being distributed by a theater owner, AMC, and it’s going to make an enormous amount of money.” He was spot-on about the financial success of her latest project, and also that studios that have typically wielded an incredible amount of power when it comes to distributing movies may now have to rethink their place in the film ecosystem./nNolan's praise for Swift extended beyond her financial prowess, which is grand enough to warrant applause from movie industry insiders. “And this is the thing: This is a format, this is a way of seeing things and sharing stories, or sharing experiences, that’s incredibly valuable,” the director and screenwriter continued, and he’s certainly right about the valuable part, if nothing else./nThe filmmaker's support for Swift didn't stop there. He made it clear that no matter the studio, there is a place for Swift's work in the industry. ""And if they don’t want it, somebody else will. So that’s just the truth of it,"" Nolan affirmed./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour made an impressive impact at the global box office from the moment it hit theaters. In its opening weekend, it became the top-grossing title in the world, earning over $123 million globally. The North American box office alone contributed nearly $93 million to that total. With these figures, Swift’s new movie has already secured its place in history as the highest-grossing concert film in U.S. history./nNolan is busy promoting Oppenheimer, which became something of a surprise box office smash this summer. It competed directly with Barbie, and the pairing of the two dissimilar pictures likely helped both perform better than they might have without the marketing ploy. Oppenheimer is likely headed for a number of Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and perhaps many more./n",3.059335412,384,Filmography,1

[+] Festival on January 23, 2020 in Park City, Utah.  (Photo by Mat Hayward/GC Images)/nIn a little over a month, Taylor Swift will take over theaters across America with her forthcoming concert movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The title is already heading toward a massive opening weekend, with perhaps $100 million or more in ticket sales. But can the film earn the singer a coveted Academy Award nomination?/nShortly after the superstar announced Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, The Wrap highlighted the fact that the movie was not going to compete for an Oscar, at least in one specific category. The title is not eligible for Best Documentary Feature, which some fans immediately suggested it could be submitted for once news of the project broke online./n""Works that are essentially promotional or instructional are not eligible, nor are works that are essentially unfiltered records of performances,"" states rules outlined by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the organization that awards the Oscars./nThose guidelines make it pretty clear that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour won't win the singer any trophies as a documentarian, but that's not the only field in which the movie could be eligible. If Swift writes and records a new song for the project, she could submit her movie for the Best Original Song Oscar instead./nWhile the bulk of the movie will surely feature Swift performing her biggest hits on stage, she could certainly find a space to include a new track if she wants to. There's no word yet on whether Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour will also include any footage that's not performance-based, such as her preparation for the show, backstage moments or more. There could potentially be plenty of opportunities for Swift to work in a new composition, but for the moment, she's keeping quiet as to whether or not she's done so./nAccording to AMPAS rules regarding Best Original Song submissions, ""An original song consists of words and music, both of which are original and written specifically for the motion picture."" The tune in question must also be ""used in the body of the motion picture or as the first music cue in the end credits.""/nSwift could conceivably write and record a new song and play it at the tail end of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour  and meet eligibility requirements. In the past, tracks ended up in the running for this prize when they only played over the credits, but that was changed several years ago. Now, the tune must actually be in the film, but only a small portion. Several recent nominated songs have essentially ended a picture by beginning while the movie is still going (but before the credits have started), so this is a tried-and-true method of securing eligibility./nSwift has been working toward an Oscar nomination for years, but so far, the honor has eluded her. She was attempting to earn a Best Live Action Short Film nod recently for her All Too Well: The Short Film music video last year, but it fell short. She has also been nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Original Song a number of times, but somehow, none of that work has translated into an Academy Award nomination./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour could change that, but there’s no telling whether it’s even eligible until Swift announces a new song...or it hits theaters and fans are treated to the tune without warning./n",21.15167872,386,Filmography,1

Entertainment that drew little notice./nHis profile has risen substantially since “Catching Kelce” aired in 2016. He has won two Super Bowls with Kansas City — catching a touchdown in each — and earned eight Pro Bowl selections while dabbling as a media personality, hosting a “Saturday Night Live” episode and helming a popular football podcast./nBut in terms of maximizing his celebrity, nothing compares to Kelce’s brush with the aura of Taylor Swift, a 12-time Grammy winner whose Eras Tour this year has shattered concert records and even registered seismic activity./nKelce and Swift, both 33, have remained quiet about whether they are friends or a couple, or just two celebrities trying to leverage each other’s fame. But fans regularly dissect Swift’s dating life and failed relationships, which she has written about in her own songs./nAfter weeks of speculation about a connection between Kelce and Swift, who broke up with the actor Joe Alwyn this year, she attended Kelce’s game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., on Sunday, watching from a luxury suite with his mother as the Chiefs trounced the Chicago Bears. Fox cameras panned to Swift’s reaction nearly every time Kelce touched the ball. The singer’s devoted swarm of fans also tuned in, with several posting on social media that they were watching football for the first time./nSwift, wearing a red-and-white outfit that matched Kansas City’s colors, was then seen leaving the stadium with Kelce./nDespite Kelce’s relative fame in the sports world, becoming part of the frenzied conversation around Swift’s every move is another ballgame. Kelce now has 3.2 million followers on Instagram. Swift has 273 million./n“This puts him on a completely different plane from where he was as a celebrity,” said Daniel Durbin, a professor of communication at the University of Southern California. “This is celebrity on steroids, and it has a powerful impact.”/nAs professional athletes near retirement in their 30s and early 40s, many begin to plot their next career moves.

This time, at the Kansas City Chiefs vs Los Angeles Chargers game, it wasn't just her voice that caught the attention but a uniquely personalized bracelet. Taylor was there to support her budding relationship with NFL star, Travis Kelce./nDonning a vintage 1990 red Chiefs sweatshirt from Ellie Mae Vintage paired with a chic short, black pleated skirt, Taylor's ensemble was already turning heads. /nBut it was a particular accessory that sent Swifties into a frenzy. Gone was her signature '13' friendship bracelet, and in its place was a new one bearing Kelce's jersey number '87'. /nThis symbolic piece was elegantly flanked by heart-beaded patterns, with the remaining beads in gold, signifying a golden new chapter in Taylor's life./nEnsconced in the luxury box, Taylor was seen in the company of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany, and his brother, Jackson.

It proved to be a good-luck charm – the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 31-17./nSwifties, meanwhile, didn't miss a beat. The comments section lit up with fans expressing their delight at Taylor's newfound happiness. /nOne devoted fan shared: “I’m happy she found someone who doesn’t shy away from her shine and treat her with love.” /nAnother cheekily referenced her ongoing tour, musing: “Can't stop her when she's in her footballer's wife era.” /nA nostalgic fan even quipped, referencing one of Taylor's lyrics, '""wear his initial on a chain round my neck, ITS OVER AND OUTDATED.”/nBut this wasn't Taylor's only rendezvous with Travis.

It seems that Fleetwood Mac may be done with, choosing to see the loss of Christine McVie as a likely conclusion for the Grammy-winning group./nIn a recent interview with Vulture, rock icon Stevie Nicks candidly discussed the future of Fleetwood Mac following the devastating passing of singer-songwriter and longtime band member McVie, in November 2022. Nicks wasn’t coy, and it seems that she feels that the band may have reached the end of the road./nReflecting on the profound impact of McVie's death, Nicks expressed her deep sense of loss and the unique bond she shared with her late bandmate. ""When Christine died, I felt like you can’t replace her. You just can’t,"" Nicks revealed. ""She was like my soul mate, my musical soul mate, and my best friend that I spent more time with than any of my other best friends outside of Fleetwood Mac.”/nNicks went on to emphasize the irreplaceable role that McVie played in the band's dynamic, both musically and personally. ""Without her, what is it? You know what I mean?”/nThe rocker then referenced Taylor Swift in her memorial, adding, ""When I think about Taylor Swift’s song ‘You’re on Your Own, Kid’ and the line ‘you always have been,’ it was like, that was Christine and I.” Nicks went on to add that she felt that “We were on our own in that band. We always were. We protected each other.""/nNicks seemed to suggest that if Fleetwood Mac did perform together again, they wouldn’t feel right using the songs that McVie wrote. ""Christine was the pop star. She wrote all those really super pop hits. None of the rest of us could write those songs,” Nicks admitted. “What would happen is we’d have to take the songs out, like we did when she actually retired for 18 years. We couldn’t re-create those songs. So we became a much more hard-rock band./nIt seems that Nicks is not alone in her feeling that Fleetwood Mac may be done with. Her comments are similar to those shared by fellow band member Mick Fleetwood earlier in 2023 when he conveyed that the loss of McVie may be it for the group. ""I think right now, I truly think the line in the sand has been drawn with the loss of Chris,"" Fleetwood stated. ""I’d say we’re done, but then we’ve all said that before. It’s sort of unthinkable right now.""/n",-4.649658741,389,Unrelated,1

The concert film is coming to theaters globally on October 13, and it is bound to become a box office smash. In fact, the title could very well make history with an eye-popping reaping in just a matter of days./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour is on track to become the highest-grossing concert film of all time, and it won't need long to capture that record. Currently, the highest-grossing concert movie in the United States is Justin Bieber's Never Say Never. That movie earned $73 million at the box office during its theatrical run./nComing in just behind Bieber's movie is one from Michael Jackson. Following his passing, the superstar's This Is It made a little more than $72 million at the box office in North America alone./nEarly projections for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour’s first-weekend box office draw are upwards of $100 million. So, it seems that when including all pre-ordered tickets, the singer's first theatrical project will break Bieber's record in its first few days of availability./nWhen looking globally, Swift will also likely smash everyone else's best showing. In that case, Jackson and Bieber swap spots. This Is It earned just under $182 million worldwide at theaters, while Bieber's Never Say Never came in at just under $100 million./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour could potentially become the highest-grossing concert film of all time with only its total North American numbers. If the title is expected to pull in around $100 million in its first weekend, that sum could climb considerably, depending on how long it lives in theaters. The movie is likely to run for a few weekends, if not months, and it could bring in $125 million or more domestically./nThe superstar recently announced that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is not just set to play North America, as was initially the case. Now, the film will hit theaters in more than 100 countries, playing in most of them on the same day. There's no telling how much bigger Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour could become in terms of its finances, but looking at Jackson and Bieber's performances, it's safe to assume that the project will likely earn at least 30% of its North American total around the world, adding to its overall box office pull../nOn the low end, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour could make $130 million, based on simple predictions, and that number could be after only a week or two. It wouldn't be odd to see the movie rake in $150 million, looking at early ticket sales and the past performance of similar releases from the biggest names in music./nWhatever the final total ends up being, one thing is certain: Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is about to become the highest-grossing concert film of all time, and it probably won't be close./n",-1.551867117,390,Filmography,1

Taylor Swift’s concert film hasn’t even been released yet and it’s already toppling box-office records. 
  /n
      Cinemark, a theater chain with about 500 locations, said that ticket sales for “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” are “setting domestic presale records” with demand “10 times higher” than any other event film the company has exhibited. The reaction has “blown everyone away,” Cinemark announced in a press release.
  /n
      Excitement has been building for the 3-hour-long film, which is opening Friday, October 13. An ad for the movie even aired during NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” last weekend, where Swift made an appearance to cheer on her possible boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce. 
  /n
      Cinemark is not the first theater chain to experience an increase in sales via Swift: AMC Theaters previously announced that the singer’s Eras Tour concert movie “shattered records for single-day advance ticket sales revenue,” with $26 million sold on the first day that presales went live on August 31.
  /n
      Swift’s movie crushed the single-day record less than three hours after tickets became available, prompting AMC to add extra showtimes where possible. 
  /n
      The concert film, which is being screened in some theaters in both IMAX and standard versions, is expected to rake in between $100 million to $125 million in its opening weekend, according to industry estimates.
/n
      Superstar Beyoncé is also releasing a film version of her “Renaissance World Tour” for a theatrical release. Ticket presales began Monday for the December 1 premiere. 
  /n
      For theaters eying a potentially grim fall with the ranks of movies thinned out by the (recently resolved) writers strike and the actors strike, the one-two punch looks like a gift from the musical gods. It’s a potential means of filling seats that doesn’t rely on what has come to look like an increasingly shaky theatrical business even with usually reliable studio blockbusters.
  /n
      In addition to Swift and Beyoncé, the box office also has been helped out by another fierce female: “Barbie.” The film hit the $1 billion global box office mark barely three weeks into its run — only about 50 films in history, adjusted for inflation, have reached the benchmark. It’s made more than $630 million in the US box office since its July release. (CNN and “Barbie” movie distributor Warner Bros. Pictures share the same parent company.)

398,Nicole Sperling,"Strong First Weekend for ‘Killers,’ but Taylor Swift Was Still No. 1",The Scorsese film’s estimated $23 million in the North American box office was a special feat considering its length and the lack of promotion by its actors.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/business/media/killers-of-the-flower-moon-movie-box-office.html,The New York Times,business,us,2023-10-22T16:25:40+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,398,"Advertisement/nSupported by/nThe Scorsese film’s estimated $23 million in the North American box office was a special feat considering its length and the lack of promotion by its actors./nBy Nicole Sperling/nMartin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” opened this weekend in over 3,600 theaters, taking in an estimated $23 million in the United States and Canada. It’s the largest box office opening for the director since the $41.4 million opening for “Shutter Island” in February 2010 (starring Leonardo DiCaprio) and a special feat considering both its length — three and a half hours — and the lack of promotional support from its cast, which includes Mr. DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, because of the actors’ strike./nIt earned an additional $21 million in its international release./n“Killers” is the largest theatrical release for Apple Studios, which will return to the box office at Thanksgiving with the Ridley Scott epic “Napoleon” and again in February with the spy caper “Argylle.”/n(Its strong showing didn’t earn bragging rights for this weekend’s box office. The No. 1 spot for the second week in a row went to “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which cost $15 million. It earned an estimated $31 million for a total of $129.8 million — a boon for AMC Theatres Distribution’s first release.)/nAccording to the worldwide distributor Paramount Pictures, the film about the murders of members of the Osage Nation, a Native American tribe in Oklahoma, in the 1920s, performed well in the top movie markets of Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco but also drew audiences in Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Mr. Scorsese filmed the movie in Oklahoma and cast a number of Osage in the film./nMore men saw the film than women, and 44 percent of the audience was under 30, a surprise for Paramount./n“That was really telling and bodes well for the future of cinema,” Paramount’s president of domestic distribution, Chris Aronson, said in an interview. “I didn’t know that many younger people would seek this movie out because, on the surface, you wouldn’t think that there would be that much appeal there.”/nThe issues surrounding the brutal treatment of the Osage Nation, he added, seemed to resonate. “Even though it occurred 100 years ago, it’s a story that needs to be told and deserves to be seen,” he said./n“Killers” also scored an A- in exit polls, according to the market research firm CinemaScore, the same score given to Mr. Scorsese’s “Goodfellas” and “The Departed.”/nWith a budget of around $200 million, even if it grosses five times its opening weekend numbers — which a lot of films by Mr. Scorsese do — it’s unlikely to earn back its cost at the box office. Perhaps that’s not an issue for the wildly acclaimed “Killers.” The movie, which was produced and financed by Apple in conjunction with Imperative Entertainment, has generated strong reviews, with The New York Times calling it a “heartbreaking masterpiece.” It’s likely to be part of the awards conversation this year./nPlus, Apple’s plan to put it directly on its service after its theatrical run should be a welcome bonus to Apple TV, which, despite producing quality work, has had difficulty attracting a significant following on its streaming service./nDavid A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office information, declared “Killers” an important movie to the industry for two reasons. One, because Mr. Scorsese is considered a “master storyteller” and “filmmakers and audiences believe this is ‘real cinema.’” And two, because Apple is venturing into new territory./n“If ‘flexibility’ is the new mantra of the theatrical movie business,” he wrote, “then this is a significant success — it establishes a viable option for the companies.”/nNicole Sperling is a media and entertainment reporter, covering Hollywood and the burgeoning streaming business.

400,"Jeremy Bogaisky, Forbes Staff","Elon Musk May Have Given Up On Privacy For His Jet Travels, But Taylor Swift Hasn’t",Forbes got an exclusive look at the celebrities and billionaires who’ve used a federal program to hide their private-plane flights. Here’s why it’s not working.,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2023/10/25/elon-musk-may-have-given-up-on-privacy-for-his-jet-travels-but-taylor-swift-hasnt/,Forbes,general,us,2023-10-25T10:30:00+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,400,"When he bought Twitter in October 2022, Elon Musk’s to-do list included giving Jack Sweeney the boot./nSweeney, a college student from Orlando, Florida, had been tracking Musk’s $65 million Gulfstream G650 and tweeting the whereabouts of the richest man on Earth. Musk wasn’t amused. He saw his privacy as a security issue. “I don’t love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,” he told Sweeney in a direct message./nMusk took his quest for privacy one step further. He enrolled in a free Federal Aviation Administration program called PIA that allows private-jet owners to hide their location by having their planes transmit alternative identity codes./nIt didn’t work. Sweeney is still publishing the movements of Musk’s G650 in real time — he’s just switched to Instagram, BlueSky and Facebook. It was easy to crack the FAA’s privacy code, Sweeney told Forbes. “You can do it in a day.” Eventually, Musk and his crew quit trying, Sweeney said, and now Musk flies unmasked. Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment./nThe FAA’s PIA program has cloaked the travels of 48 private jets this year, according to JetSpy, a subscription flight-tracking service. The Delaware-based company has been able to figure out the owners of 38 of those planes and shared those findings exclusively with Forbes. They’re a mix of the bold-faced names of celebrity gossip and billionaire masters of the tech and financial universes, with some surprising exceptions./nDespite the jet owners’ enrollments in PIA, it’s still possible to see how frequently Taylor Swift has visited her tall American boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in Kansas City; where Magic Johnson is chasing the next deal in his Gulfstream III; how many times Kenneth Griffin has visited France, or where Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin and Evan Spiegel — or at least their planes — have taken off and landed./nThe public can also follow jets owned by Walmart and employee-owned WinCo Foods as they zig-zag the country, and we’re privy to the otherwise hush-hush athlete-recruiting efforts of the University of Kansas, which has been taking flak for years from faculty over the expense of its Cessna Citation CJ4./nPlane watchers follow the aircraft by tracking transponder signals that planes have been required to transmit since 2020. The transponders flash out location, altitude, speed and a unique ID code assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)./nThe system is called Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or ADS-B. When it was first sketched out in the 1990s, its designers didn’t anticipate that plane-spotting enthusiasts would use inexpensive receivers to capture the signals and collaborate online to create coverage maps that track planes around the world./nHence the FAA’s privacy program, which allows jets to send out fake codes to thwart identification by everyone except the authorities. It costs nothing to enroll in PIA — short for Privacy ICAO Aircraft Address — but it’s complicated and time-consuming for plane owners to change their codes and test whether they’re functional./nExperts told Forbes that the program isn’t working because not enough aircraft are using it — the FAA said it’s issued about 390 alternate ID codes since PIA began in 2019 — and jet owners don’t change their fake codes frequently enough./n“It’s useless,” says Martin Strohmeier, cofounder of the European crowd-sourced flight-tracking website OpenSky Network. “At worst you could even say it’s dangerous because people may believe it gives them some sort of cover, which it does not.”/nNot that Taylor, if we can call her that, can hope for any cover. Millions of Swifties follow the pop icon’s every move. Still, flight tracking may provide special insight into her heart. Her plane has visited Kansas City three times so far in October. Just about everyone knows Swift was in the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium on October 12 to watch a football game featuring the guy whose career she made. JetSpy — and Sweeney’s Instagram account @taylorswiftjets — inform us that her jet dropped her off that day, returned home to Nashville, then came back to Kansas City on October 14. Heart-hands emoji./nOthers fly to destinations for reasons unknown to outsiders. Griffin, for example. Forbes estimates his net worth at $33.5 billion; one of his firms, Citadel Securities, acts as the intermediary for more than one in three U.S. retail stock trades. His plane, a Bombardier Global Express (price tag: $12 million used), has notched 195 flights this year through Monday, traveling 257,000 nautical miles. According to JetSpy, the billionaire’s plane has visited France more often this year than Chicago, where Citadel was headquartered until last year (it moved to Florida) and where it still has a big presence./nThough we have no special insight into Griffin’s heart — he didn’t respond to requests to talk about his air travel — we can surmise that he, like Musk, has security reasons for wanting his jet to fly under the radar. For instance, Griffin’s whereabouts are tracked on Reddit by retail stock investors who blame him for the controversial 2021 halt in GameStop trading on the Robinhood platform, which helped big trading houses dig out from under billions of dollars in losses while hurting many of the trade-at-home folks. Griffin denied involvement./n“I’ve seen my clients deal with threats to their safety because of people that were tracking them,” Dan Drohan, CEO of Solairus Aviation, a company that manages over 300 private jets for their owners but has no connection to Griffin, told Forbes. “It’s most upsetting for the ones that have kids.”/nSweeney, who Musk allowed to set up a new account on X (nee Twitter) tracking Musk’s jet as long as he waits 24 hours to announce its location, defends cracking the PIA codes and publicizing what he finds. “This account has every right to post jet whereabouts,” he tweeted in 2022 before he was banished. The transmissions of planes’ locations are public information, he said, and “every aircraft in the world is required to have a transponder, even AF1,” a reference to Air Force One, the U.S. president’s plane./nAnother reason for the jet set’s touchiness: environmental advocates have used plane-tracking to measure the harm that private jets cause to the world’s climate and to shame their owners. For instance, the average American produces 16 tons of carbon dioxide a year. By comparison, Griffin’s jet, in the first nine-plus months of 2023, has emitted about 12 million tons./nTracking also allows for corporate espionage of the legal variety. Brad Pierce, who owns Restaurant Equipment World, told Forbes that the sales calls he makes in his Cirrus SR-22 have enabled him to expand his Florida-based business. He said it’s also allowed a large competitor that he won’t name to monitor his travels and then drop in on the potential customers he’s been pitching. He said that the sources for that information are the company’s executives themselves, who’ve confessed to him at industry conventions. “They said, ‘We have one guy in our office who is just nonstop trying to track where you are so we can send our own people in afterward,’” Pierce told Forbes./nGaining an edge in business is a selling point for subscription jet-tracking sites like JetSpy, Quandl and JetTrack./nFor PIA to work, aircraft owners should ideally change their fake identity codes for every flight, according to Strohmeier of OpenSky Network./nRight now that’s impossible, said Rene Cervantes, operations vice president for aircraft manager Solairus Aviation, which has a handful of clients who use PIA. Changing the code requires the transponder manufacturer to produce a software update on a compact disc, of all things, which can take a month. Many owners interested in the program don’t follow through after hearing what’s involved, Cervantes told Forbes./nSome PIA enrollees appear to have given up. Among those who haven’t flown under an alternate address since last year are Kim Kardashian, Mark Zuckerberg and the private-equity giant Blackstone Group, led by billionaire Stephen Schwarzman./nFrench billionaire Bernard Arnault has given up, too. But he’s taken it one step further. Last year, after the CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH came under fire from a Twitter account looking to shame him over his carbon-dioxide emissions, he sold the company jet./nArnault, whose $187.6 billion fortune Forbes said this month makes him the second-wealthiest person in the world, is now a renter, not an owner./n/n",0,400,Unrelated,-1

Both the LAPD and the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department placed extra patrols on trains after a man was killed Wednesday night on the to the K (Crenshaw) Line, one station away from the Hawthorne/Lennox Station that ran one of two shuttle buses that dropped off fans at the stadium./nMetro rail lines A, B, D, E, C and K will operate late, until 2 a.m. to accommodate Swifties after the concerts, which run Aug. 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9. Since no train actually stops at SoFi, two free shuttles took passengers directly to the concert venue from a train station. One ran from the K (Crenshaw) Line’s Downtown Inglewood Station. The other ran from the C Line’s Hawthorne/Lennox Station. The shuttles will run 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. before each show, and for 90 minutes after the concerts./nBut the two shuttles were not full Thursday and the line to get on board the K Line at the Downtown Inglewood Station was nearly empty around 5 p.m., as extra accommodations went unneeded./nRows of security tape forming snaking lines before the shuttles became merely decorative as buses came and went with space inside to spare. A pop-up stand at one station selling TAP cards — in anticipation that there may be long lines at its three vending machines — struggled to get any traffic./nThose who did take public transit often rode early and were prepared in advance./nViridiana Gonzalez and Victoria Kravitz knew they wanted the peace of mind of riding Metro. The pair, who have been friends and Swift fans since high school, left from Arcadia on the A Line, wanting to avoid the frustrations that might come from riding with their parents./nKravitz said the more than two-hour public transit commute wasn’t a concern, and well worth it to escape the anxiety of traffic, parking, or other logistics./n“We get to get there early and enjoy the atmosphere and experience,” she said. “That’s better than stressing with my parents for two hours.”/nMany concert-goers were being dropped off in the ride-hailing lot at SoFi. Those who beat the crowds and got there early seemed to fare better./nCeline Castaneda took a Lyft from Long Beach to SoFi that took only 40 minutes and cost her $45. She arrived shortly before 11 a.m./n“I may carpool after the concert with some of the people I met,” she said./nGail Gallaher of Pasadena took the A Line train from the Memorial Park Station at around 2:30 p.m after waiting more than 20 minutes./nShe planned on meeting her husband at the stadium, after he parks their car at a school that rented out parking spaces. The couple had reserved a space there ahead of time./nWhile the train connections were a bit like alphabet soup, she is a veteran Metro user and felt confident she could find her way. “I am taking the A Line,” she said, pausing for several seconds, “to the God I don’t even know I think the Expo Line, then to the K Line, then to the shuttle that will get us to SoFi.”/nFor many Swifties, the concert is just part of the night out. And that’s what they say makes her concerts different. Some call it a spiritual experience./n“I think it will be fun,” Gallaher said before she boarded her first train. “Once I get closer to the concert I am going to see other people there and that will be fun.”/nMaria Gonzalez, 31, took a bus from Tijuana to Union Station on Thursday, the first leg on her journey to her first-ever Taylor Swift concert./nShe was on her phone hailing an Uber, leaning against the Metro information booth at the downtown train hub in the early afternoon./n“I am very excited. I don’t believe this moment is happening because it is here already,” she said. She bought the tickets as part of the original sale by Ticketmaster, not through a re-sale, she said.

The celebrity couple has been in the news for well over a week now, and despite the fatigue from many -- Chris 'Mad Dog' Russo's rant being among the most vocal -- companies like FanDuel just can't help but lean into a profitable storyline. Are they for real or is this ""Love Story"" just some extravagant publicity stunt?/nTime will tell, but one thing's for certain when it comes to the media, social media, newspapers, football fans, Swifties, and just about everyone else within the 50 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam: ""You need to calm down."" Regardless, Kelce and Swift take their tour on the road to Broadway, a place that puts on all the great shows. The traditional circus hasn't been in town for a few years now, but that's simply because the New York Jets exist and there was only room for one. It seems like ages since Aaron Rodgers marched out of the MetLife Stadium tunnel holding an American flag, but this is Zach Wilson's team now, whether you like it or not. /nOne of the most hyped ""Sunday Night Football"" games of the year was expected to feature Rodgers against Patrick Mahomes for the first time. Instead, we're more likely to be treated to non-stop split screens involving Swift and Rodgers, two people who won't be on the field. There will be some actual football, though, even if it is just a sideshow to the event everyone can't stop talking about. So, buckle up and enjoy whatever this is, and for all the fans paying ridiculous prices for a glimpse of Ms. Swift — make sure your phone is charged. /nTo Travis and Taylor, ""Welcome to New York."" It's been waiting for you. Well, actually, the swamps of northern New Jersey have. Enjoy the traffic and a look at the famous skyline./nFor bettors, where there is hype, there's also an opportunity to make some money. FanDuel has released a special prop bets menu, cleverly called ""Prop Stars"" for the Swift-inspired wagers. Here's a look at how you can catch some cash in prime time. /nMORE: Jets vs. Chiefs betting preview/nThe Jets know that Kelce is trouble long before he even walks in. If they want any chance in this game, they'll have to slow down No. 87. This is a New York defense that's been very good, although not quite great, over the last year and continues to improve. Robert Saleh's troops have held opponents in check, giving their anemic offense a fighting chance most weeks, but if there's one thing that Gang Green struggles to defend against, it's the tight end. They're giving up the fifth-most receiving yards to the position this season (56.3) and just allowed Pharoah Brown to beat them for a long 58-yard touchdown last Sunday. Getting +140 is a nice price for the best pass-catcher in this game, but there's too much blowout potential to warrant taking a flier here.  /nOur pick: Pass/nIf this bet ends up cashing, the ""Seeing Red"" tagline would apply to a lot more than just Chiefs fans. Bettors would be in the green, and those wearing green would be the ones with red-ish, cartoon-like faces. Odds are, Wilson would have to be atrocious again considering New York's defense isn't a pushover. The Jets often like to make games close, even when they seemingly have no business in doing so. Even if they are steamrolled, a garbage time score is more than enough to ruin this wager. /nOur pick: Pass/nOut of all the specials, this one is our favorite. The Chiefs will likely score first whether they get the opening kickoff or not. When we look at the Jets, we see an offensive coordinator that somehow underrated Micah Parsons and a team that refuses to take the training wheels off their former gunslinging quarterback. Wilson has turned into ""Checkdown Charlie"" as a result of conservative coaching, and we don't expect that to change in the early going. Lean into the narrative and sprinkle a little cash on Kelce to break the plane first./nOur pick: Bet on it/nObviously, based on our last recommendation, we're friendzoning this bet and not laying down any action on it. /nOur pick: Pass/nThe strength of the Jets roster is along the defensive line, and the Chiefs are a pass-first team that loves to light it up through the air. This is the first time that Patrick Mahomes is playing in the New York area. He'll want to put on a show, and Andy Reid certainly isn't going to hold him back. Don't expect the Chiefs to start running until it's time to chew the clock. /nOur pick: Pass/nRanch is a fine condiment and beloved by many, which makes this wager something that should be seen as an insult to ranch fans everywhere. Unless the Jets make this a close game or send it to overtime, we have a hard time believing that Kelce will even be on the field to score the last touchdown. Avoid this one like people with taste buds avoid bleu cheese and treat your nuggets with respect. /nOur pick: Pass/nIf you asked the average Jets' fan what is holding this roster back, the overwhelming results would be Wilson. ""I'm the problem, it's me,"" would probably qualify as the lyrics played in his walk-up song if fans had anything to say about it. But Wilson doesn't have time to be the anti-hero, or villain, as traditionalists would say. He needs to flip the script and shake it off. The Jets need to let him sling the ball around the field instead of worrying about the bad turnovers. They aren't winning this game 14-10, and they aren't winning anything if they can't let their quarterback be who he is. Are we betting this? Absolutely not, but that would be one heck of a plot twist, right? Perhaps the script writers are working overtime. /nOur pick: Pass/nWhen it comes to Kelce's greatest hits, he prefers to save them for division rivals like the Raiders and Chargers. In your wildest dreams this bet might hit, and it might happen in reality too. Kelce could be schmoozing in the suite when the second half begins rather than throwing blocks and catching footballs on the field. But if the Jets keep it close, they are prone to being exploited by players like Kelce. With receivers lacking on the Chiefs sideline, the tight end might put on a show that is typically only found in show business. Considering he hosted “Saturday Night Live” back in March, Kelce is familiar with how to tell a story. We have him scoring once, so what’s another two times to cash a monster long shot? Don't count on it, but don't rule it out either. And please, have fun and bet responsibly. /nOur pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)/nThe Jets are currently back in a familiar place as the laughingstock of the NFL. Swift, like many celebrities, has plenty of exes, but she always scores again. Maybe the haters are right. Maybe Kelce will be the subject of the next big hit. Maybe the publicists are cashing checks with this brilliant idea. Maybe it's real. Time will tell, but when the relationship inevitably falls apart like most dream celebrity couples do, there is always another someone. Point is, the Jets are without the quarterback they married, and now they're back together with Wilson. It's not glamorous, but they'll score again. Shutting out NFL teams is no easy task, but the Chiefs defense is much improved and the Jets look like a team that doesn’t have a quarterback. Don’t consider it likely to hit, but +3400 wagers hardly ever are. Consider this a fun bet, unless you’re a Jets fan, and see how long K.C. can keep NYC off the scoreboard. They might just do it for the entire game./nOur pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)/nNick Brinkerhoff is an editorial intern at The Sporting News.",0,402,Social impact,1

He had already bought tickets for a Sunday showing of the film when the first wave were initially released last month./nThough the megaplex in Times Square is used to being a hub of activity, the last-minute announcement of earlier showtimes — and the fact that many had already bought tickets for the weekend — made the turnout seem more like a private viewing party. And Swifties took advantage of it./nMarco Zefi, an engineer from Queens, and Liz Burg, a user-interface designer who lives in Lower Manhattan, made sure to grab their picture in the lobby before entering the auditorium. The two opted to wear gray as Ms. Burg wore a “Reputation”-era T-shirt and Mr. Zefi had on his “Speak Now”-era T-shirt. He also brought a Taylor Swift tote bag from her rerelease of the album “Red.”/nThe friends said they met almost 10 years ago in Ms. Swift’s New York apartment after winning entry to a secret listening session ahead of the release of her “1989” album. They recently made it to the tour’s opening night this spring in Arizona./n“Taylor had just released ‘Shake It Off’ and she ordered us all pizza,” Ms. Burg said. “It was that time when she went pop and New York was such a part of her album.

415,"Hugh McIntyre, Senior Contributor",One Of Taylor Swift’s ‘1989’ Singles Has Somehow Never Been Certified,What’s shocking is that one of the official singles from the album has yet to receive any recognition from the RIAA.,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2023/10/09/one-of-taylor-swifts-1989-singles-has-somehow-never-been-certified/,Forbes,general,us,2023-10-09T12:00:00+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,415,"LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 15:  Recording artist Taylor Swift performs onstage during The 58th ... [+] GRAMMY Awards at Staples Center on February 15, 2016 in Los Angeles, California.  (Photo by Kevin Winter/WireImage)/nIn just a matter of weeks, Taylor Swift is poised to unleash her highly-anticipated re-release of the album 1989, now titled 1989 (Taylor’s Version). The revamped version of 1989 will feature slight reworkings of the original tracks from an album that not only achieved massive sales as a collection but also spawned seven hit singles./nAmong its popular singles, which include chart-toppers like ""Blank Space,"" ""Bad Blood,"" and ""Shake It Off,"" there exists an intriguing oddity: one of the official singles from the project has never been certified by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America)./nThe RIAA is responsible for bestowing prestigious certifications such as gold, platinum, or diamond plaques upon tracks and albums that meet specific sales thresholds. Gold is awarded for 500,000 equivalent units sold, platinum for one million, and diamond for 10 million./nAlmost every song featured on 1989 has earned some form of certification, which is a common occurrence for some the most successful albums of recent years. However, what’s shocking is that one of the official singles from the album has yet to receive any recognition from the RIAA./n""Out of the Woods"" was chosen as the sixth official single from 1989. Released in January 2016, well over a year and a half after Swift started promoting the album, it arrived as one of the final offerings from the project. Surprisingly, despite the album being out in the world for more than a year by the time the tune was promoted, the track still performed well./nSwift propelled ""Out of the Woods"" into the top 20 on the Hot 100, and it peaked at No. 18. The single also enjoyed success on the radio, landing within the top 20 on all three of Billboard's pop-focused radio charts. Still, despite industry acclaim and evident public interest, the single has yet to achieve even a gold certification./nTo put this anomaly into perspective, several non-single tracks from 1989 that never received the official single treatment have garnered at least one RIAA award. ""This Love"" achieved platinum certification, while album cuts like ""All You Had to Do Was Stay"" and ""How You Get the Girl"" have been certified gold./nIt is probable that ""Out of the Woods"" has accumulated significant sales and streams deserving of recognition, and it may be a matter of Swift's label or the RIAA taking the time to process the necessary paperwork and confirm the consumption numbers for award presentation. While it remains uncertain when and at what level the certification will be bestowed, it is likely that Swift's single will ultimately join its fellow 1989 tracks in receiving the recognition it deserves—perhaps soon./n",-1.925687459,415,Discography,0

The city of Glendale, Arizona was ceremonially renamed to Swift City for March 17-18 in honor of The Eras Tour. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nWhile Taylor Swift is currently engrossed in the promotion of her single ""Cruel Summer"" from her 2019 album Lover, she might already have her sights set on her next move. ""Cruel Summer"" gained unexpected popularity earlier this year and has now found its way into the top 10 of the Hot 100 chart, with a chance to rise even further in the coming weeks. Amidst her focus on the catchy pop track, she might be secretly contemplating her next musical move./nWhether Swift intends to release more singles from her latest album of original material, Midnights, remains unknown. Considering the series of events that have unfolded since the album's late 2022 release, she might be ready to move on, or she might be trying to choose what comes next. One track in particular seems to be the frontrunner for single status, and it's a very good choice./nHints have been circulating that ""Bejeweled"" is in the running to be chosen as the fourth official single from Midnights, although Swift hasn't officially confirmed this speculation. If this turns out to be true, it would indeed be a strategic choice./nTo begin with...""Bejeweled"" is already a hit in its own right. During the week of the Midnight’s release, Swift dominated the entire top 10 of the Hot 100, with 10 tracks from the album taking up space in the competitive region. ""Bejeweled"" reached as high as No. 6 on the chart, so it doesn’t have much higher to go if it is promoted./nThe song even received its own music video, but that doesn't mean it's been given the full might of a Swift single. It has thus far been held back to promotional single status, and there's more that could be done with the tune./nAs Swift continues her The Eras Tour, she has been captivating massive crowds with performances of the songs from Midnights. The U.S. leg has concluded, and the tour is currently making its mark in Central America. With ""Bejeweled"" making its appearance on the tour's setlist each evening, Swift has the opportunity to remind tens of thousands of fans every night of the song's appeal. This attention could translate into increased streaming numbers and purchases if Swift officially announces ""Bejeweled"" as her next single./nSpeculations around ""Bejeweled"" being promoted as a single gained momentum just before Swift embarked on her six-night ""residency"" at Los Angeles's SoFi Stadium. The venue's official Twitter account shared altered images that hinted at several special things in her future./nNotably, one teaser alluded to Swift's announcement of her upcoming re-recorded album, 1989 (Taylor's Version). With this prediction turning out to be very true, the image in the same tweet referring to ""Bejeweled"" cannot be overlooked./nAs Swift balances her tour efforts and pursues the No. 1 spot for ""Cruel Summer"" on the Hot 100, she is simultaneously working on another project. 1989 (Taylor's Version) is anticipated to drop in late October, and how she’ll approach promoting the set remains a mystery. It could potentially become her most successful re-release yet, generating a multitude of hit singles./nIn this context, the potential selection of ""Bejeweled"" as a single from Midnights could either complement or influence these upcoming plans. If Swift does decide to shift her focus back to Midnights, ""Bejeweled"" might prove to be an excellent choice for a successful single release, but at this point, there’s no telling what she plans on doing./nNote: This article has been updated to include language clarifying that ""Bejeweled"" has already been released as a promotional single, but not a full-fledged single./n",3.570345891,416,Discography,1

It started as a demo by John Lennon, created after the band broke up.

/nDuring a recent episode of her podcast, High Low With EmRata, model and actress Emily Ratajkowski referred to herself as a “misogynist” because of past thoughts on Taylor Swift. While speaking with “Rush” singer Troye Sivan, Ratajkowski revealed that she never enjoyed Swift’s music in the past, but started to appreciate the highly-celebrated artist when she saw her live. /n“I was not a Swiftie and now I’m like, ‘You know what that means? That means I was a misogynist that I didn’t fuck with Taylor Swift,” Ratajkowski told Sivan. “I went to her concert and I was like, ‘This person is an incredible songwriter, an incredible performer, and anybody who says anything else, like, they have issues. And actually maybe not a very sophisticated palette.’ … If you don’t like Taylor Swift, then, like, you don’t understand things,” she continued. /nRELATED: Anti-Hero? Nope. Taylor Swift Gives Tour Team Over $55 Million in Bonuses/nThis is not the first time in recent memory that Ratajkowski has discussed Swift publicly. A few months ago, Ratajkowski expressed disdain on social media for the way Swift was treated by Ellen Degeneres in a clip that has recently resurfaced online. The clip in question depicts the former talk show host grilling Swift about her dating history./nIn the clip, Degeneres has Swift participate in a game where photos of Swift with different famous men flash on a screen. Swift is told to ring a bell each time a photo depicting Swift and an ex appears, and Swift is visibly uncomfortable throughout the segment. “Stop it, stop it, stop! This makes me feel so bad about myself,” Swift shouts while seemingly holding back tears in the video. /n“This is so fucked up,” Ratajkowski wrote on social media in regards to the clip. “She’s literally begging her to stop.”/nSwift has been making a huge buzz in the media as of late with her record-breaking Eras Tour. It was recently reported that Swift gave her tour team $55 million bonuses. Truck drivers who worked the Eras tour were given a $100,000 bonus by Swift. /nWhen the Eras Tour stopped in Seattle on July 22 and July 23, Swift fans cheered so hard, they created a sensation similar to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake. Seismologist Jackie Caplan-Auerbach discussed the occurrence with CNN, saying the shaking caused by Swift fans was more severe than that of the 2011 NFL game known as “Beast Quake.”/n“The primary difference is the duration of shaking. Cheering after a touchdown lasts for a couple seconds, but eventually it dies down. It’s much more random than a concert,” Caplan-Auerbach said. “For Taylor Swift, I collected about 10 hours of data where rhythm controlled the behavior. The music, the speakers, the beat. All that energy can drive into the ground and shake it.”/nPhoto by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic/nSee more/nOnly members can comment. Become a member. Already a member? Log In./n

A look at moms and the ""women's multiplier effect.""",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/newsletter/2023-08-15/taylor-swift-greta-gerwig-and-power-great-stuff-made-by-women-the-wide-shot,latimes,general,us,2023-08-15T14:00:20+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,427,"Welcome to the Wide Shot, a newsletter about the business of entertainment. Sign up here to get it in your inbox./nNote to Hollywood: When you create a cultural event that appeals to multiple generations of women, you might get a billion-dollar blockbuster. /nGreta Gerwig’s “Barbie” has grossed more than $1.18 billion at the global box office, turning movie theater auditoriums into seas of pink. Taylor Swift’s Eras tour,  which last week concluded a run of six sold-out shows at Inglewood’s SoFi stadium,  is projected to earn a staggering $1.3 billion. Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour is headed for a gross of more than $500 million in ticket sales, according to Billboard. /nEach event is a phenomenon in its own right, owing to the quality of its creator’s work and vision. /nBut collectively, they also represent the pent-up demand among consumers whose buying power has always been a powerful economic driver but has clearly been waiting for something big to explode. It’s not often that the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia touts the effect of a pop music tour on the local economy, the way it did for Eras. /nWall Street Journal reporters Sarah Krouse and Anne Steele partly ascribed the boom to what they called the “women’s multiplier effect.” That’s what happens when female consumers show up in groups for a film or concert, buying not just tickets but also clothing, dolls, drinks and hotel rooms for an all-out experience. It’s what gave “Barbie” screenings their party-like atmosphere, complete with themed cocktails and costumes./n“Women have always been a deeply underestimated economic force,” UTA’s Blair Kohan told the Journal. /nThe boost from group-buying is reflected in the ticketing numbers. /nThirty-eight percent of moviegoers for “Barbie”  have gone in  groups of three or more, according to data firm Movio, compared to 25% for the typical film. Nearly one in  10 (9%)  have gone in  groups of five or more, compared to 5% for other movies. There’s also a significant amount of repeat business, with 7% of moviegoers  seeing it again. About 60% of the “Barbie” audience is female, Movio said. /nAnd there’s a more specific demographic that has flexed its muscle at the movies and at packed stadium concerts: moms. /nA crucial factor in the success of “Barbie”  is that it appeals to mothers (represented in the film by America Ferrera’s character, Gloria) who grew up with the Mattel dolls and can now share that experience with the next generation, said Larry Vincent, a USC Marshall School of Business marketing professor who has worked with brands including Mattel. /n“One of the things that we’re seeing here is a rite of passage,” Vincent said. “It’s making them feel good about that time in their lives.”/nA similar cross-generational theme is playing out amid the Eras tour, with moms and dads taking their children to what, for many, is their first concert. Whole families are going together. Attendees are returning for multiple nights, which, given the ticket prices (which were going for upward of $1,000 on the resale market), reflects the tour’s astounding draw. /nSwift made Eras the ultimate FOMO (fear of missing out)-inducing event, with a 3½-hour set list and a multisensory experience that  lighted up TikTok for days on end. Not only is this Swift’s first tour since 2018 but it’s also the first one to come after the COVID-19 pandemic. She made it count for her fans, using it as a platform to announce the re-recording of her album “1989.” /n“With both these two summer phenomenons, we have this really strong ritual dimension of consumer behavior at play here,” Vincent said. /n“Part of the virality of ‘Barbie’ is that it’s tapped into this cultural thread that has multiple generations involved. And I think there’s a similar piece with Taylor Swift. Just look at the amount of commerce that’s happening with people booking hotels and buying the friendship bracelets. Those are pretty powerful forces in consumer behavior.” /nAs Swift turns young people into concertgoers, “Barbie” is bringing people back to the movies in the post-pandemic era. /nAbout  1 in 5 ticket buyers for “Barbie” in the U.S. — 22% — hadn’t seen a film in theaters  in the last six months, according to Movio. “Infrequent” moviegoers, or those who trek to the multiplex two times or fewer every six months, represented nearly half (46%) of attendees. /n“We’re pulling people off the couch, and that’s what you see when you get box office grosses like that,” said Matthew Liebmann, chief innovation and data officer for Movio’s parent company, Vista Group, who also hosts the “Behind the Screens” podcast. “You have to get the people who don’t come that often.” /nThe movie industry ought to have absorbed the message by now, although the number of studios run by women remains a minority. To be sure, billion-dollar blockbusters are outliers, pretty much by definition. But it would be a mistake to witness a summer like this and shake it off as a fluke. /nAfter more than 100 days of striking, the Writers Guild of America resumed negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the major studios, on Friday afternoon. /nThe parties have agreed to meet again with the union’s full negotiating team, and the WGA is expected to respond to the studios’ counterproposal. The best sign that the negotiations are for real this time? The lack of bomb-throwing rhetoric immediately following last week’s meeting. /nMore strike coverage: /n— Video game voice actors say ‘soul of the industry is on trial’ with unregulated AI. As the actors’ strike continues, voice actors hope for their own contract requiring consent and compensation for AI to reproduce their voice or likeness./n— The King’s last hurrah: Elvis Presley’s ‘Aloha From Hawaii via Satellite’ turns 50. The famous 1973 concert, beamed around the world to a global audience, gets a lavish reissue in the wake of the smash success of Baz Luhrmann’s ‘Elvis.’/n— Creative Artists Agency to lay off 60 people as strikes drag on. CAA’s cuts come as the industry continues to reel from dual Hollywood strikes that have shut down many productions./n— ‘I’m not going to make $1’: The director of ‘Sound of Freedom’ breaks his silence. After weeks distancing himself from the controversy around his summer box-office sensation, Alejandro Monteverde finally tells ‘the whole story.’/n— ICYMI: Laura Jarrett named co-anchor of NBC’s ‘Saturday Today.’ Hallmark Media chief Wonya Lucas, praised for expanding diversity, steps down. Emmy Awards telecast pushed to Jan. 15. ‘Barbie’ banned in Lebanon and Kuwait. CNN overhauls its program lineup. TV stations head Wendy McMahon takes over CBS News./nBob Iger priced Disney+ too low when the service launched in November 2019 at $6.99 a month. /nIn October, the cost of watching Walt Disney Co.’s marquee streamer ad-free will increase to $13.99, up $3 from the current monthly fee ($10.99) and double the original price tag. /nThe reasons for this are clear. Disney+ arrived at a time when Wall Street rewarded subscriber growth, and Disney delivered big time. Now, user acquisition has plateaued and profitability is the name of the game. So Disney has to charge more and spend less on content. /nUltimately, that means Disney+ subscribers are going to pay more for less stuff. /nThis is happening all over the industry. Disney’s ad-free Hulu is leaping to $17.99 a month. Netflix and NFL+ have jacked up their rates./nThe change will probably drive more people to watch Disney+ with commercials, at a cost of $7.99. That’s fine, because advertising brings in plenty of cash. Iger also hinted, pretty clearly, on last week’s earnings call that Disney+ will soon follow Netflix’s lead by cracking down on password sharing. /nWill viewers rebel the same way they do when the prices rise at Disneyland? We’ll see./nRunner up: This chart /nNielsen says linear television viewing (broadcast plus cable) fell below 50% of U.S. TV viewing for this first time last month. /n— Aliya Sabharwal writes: Wall Street predators destroyed Toys ‘R’ Us.

At the 11th hour, Swift postponed her Saturday show until Monday, to the dismay of thousands of fans who had already started filling the stadium. The military police said a fan who was in Rio de Janeiro for the regularly scheduled concert on Sunday was stabbed to death earlier that morning./nThe fatalities and other problems were a departure from the triumphant first leg of Swift’s Eras Tour, a career-spanning production that broke records in North America. As the tour’s second show in Rio de Janeiro approached on Sunday night, fans grappled with ruined travel plans, extreme heat and disappointment./nAnne Di Motta, 30, a psychologist in São Paulo, Brazil, was supposed to attend the Saturday night show and said she would be returning home before the rescheduled concert on Monday because she had to work./n“I spent the last 17 years waiting for the opportunity to go, to fulfill my teenage dream of meeting someone I’ve known since her first single,” Di Motta said. “And to be sitting three hours in a chair, completely wet with sweat, having to overcome several personal challenges to be there completely alone, to receive the news that it was canceled — it was completely devastating.”/nThe Saturday night show was postponed because of the extreme temperatures, Swift said in an Instagram post hours before the concert was supposed to begin at an open-air soccer stadium. “The safety and well-being of my fans, fellow performers and crew has to and always will come first,” she said./nAt that point, thousands of fans had traveled to see Swift, enduring the peak of the day’s heat, which reached 93 degrees Fahrenheit, or 34 degrees Celsius, before they were asked to leave the venue.

Now, before the title has even reached theaters, it has already surpassed an incredible milestone./nWith about a week to go until its cinematic release, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour has already exceeded $100 million in advance ticket sales globally.

AMC is distributing Swift’s film./nWith $100 million already earned in presale tickets, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour stands as one of the most successful concert films of all time...and it hasn’t even opened yet. Only a handful of concert-focused movies have passed that milestone, and it’s likely that Swift’s is the first to do soil with presales alone./nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour shows a slightly truncated version of Swift’s current trek, The Eras Tour.

The trek picks back up in 2024, and she’ll take her shows to Europe and Asia, before returning to the U.S. for a few more ending dates later in the year./nBy the time Swift is done with The Eras Tour, it will become the highest-grossing concert tour of all time.

(Photo by John Shearer/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nWeek after week, Taylor Swift continues to achieve feats on the Billboard charts that are nothing short of remarkable. Her accomplishments often rival the most significant milestones in any other artist's career. The current week is no exception, as her performance on a specific Billboard ranking underscores not only her influence and popularity but also her ability to manage multiple successful projects simultaneously./nPresently, Swift occupies eight spots on Billboard's Canadian Hot 100, the weekly compilation of the most-consumed songs in Canada. While this is an impressive achievement, it's not her number of charting tracks that's particularly striking. Instead, it's the range of albums these songs hail from that truly stands out./nAmong the eight tracks Swift currently has charting on the Canadian Hot 100, they originate from five distinct albums. Few artists can manage the feat of sending multiple tracks from more than one of their own albums to a competitive ranking of hits at one time. Achieving such a showing with five albums at once is virtually unheard of, and Swift might be one of the few—if not the first—to accomplish such a remarkable feat./nAt the forefront of Swift's current successes on the Canadian Hot 100 is ""Cruel Summer."" This latest hit from the singer reaches a new peak of No. 2, and it is potentially poised to claim the chart's top spot, if it can surpass Morgan Wallen's formidable single ""Last Night."" ""Cruel Summer,"" featured on her 2019 pop album Lover, was recently released as an official single after enjoying newfound popularity among fans./nReturning to the top 10 is ""Karma,"" the most recent single from her latest entirely original release, Midnights. The song rises once again to No. 10, having previously reached No. 4. Not far behind, another track from Midnights, ""Anti-Hero,"" remains popular at No. 20./nIn an unexpected move, the next two charting singles from Swift are both from her 2014 blockbuster album 1989. ""Style"" and ""Blank Space"" make modest ascents, reaching Nos. 34 and 36, respectively. These tracks, which remain among her top-performing songs ever, have experienced renewed interest following Swift's announcement of the re-recorded version of 1989 is set for release this fall./nJust a couple of positions below ""Blank Space,"" there's ""August."" Though not formally released as a single, the track has garnered substantial fan appreciation. Originally part of her surprise album Folklore, released amid the global pandemic in 2020, it has resurfaced on several Billboard charts, appropriately coinciding with the change from July to August./nSwift's final two placements on the Canadian Hot 100 stem from her most recent project, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version). This re-recorded and re-released edition of her early work proved to be a massive global success upon its release a month ago. This week, ""I Can See You (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"" rises to No. 63, after previously reaching as high as No. 8. Occupying the No. 76 spot is ""Enchanted (Taylor’s Version),"" a favorite re-recording among Canadian fans./n",1.317174487,438,Achievements,1

[+] Center on August 26, 2019 in Newark, New Jersey. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for MTV)/nJust a day or so ago, Taylor Swift finally announced 1989 (Taylor’s Version), the latest in her series of re-recorded early albums. The set, which will see her rework and add new tunes to her pop blockbuster 1989, is coming in late October. The immense excitement around the announcement may be so huge that it could have a very meaningful impact on the first edition of the catchy set./nCurrently, 1989 stands as Swift’s second-biggest album in America in terms of units shifted. The title has been certified nine-times platinum by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America). That means the blockbuster has moved nine million equivalent units. It has managed that huge sum thanks in part to huge sales but also due to the success of its many singles./nThe RIAA takes streams of songs featured on an album into consideration, and they factor heavily into its current methodology when it comes to certifying titles. So the more fans stream the songs on 1989, the more equivalent album units it moves. Singles like “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space,” and “Bad Blood” all rank as among Swift’s biggest and most-certified, so as listeners continue to press play on them (and many others from the project) regularly and throughout the nearly nine years since 1989 debuted, they are helping to add more equivalent album units to its total./n/nNow that 1989 and the updated 1989 (Taylor’s Version) are in the news and trending across social media, attention to that music has been renewed. Millions around the country are bound to turn to streaming sites and continue streaming 1989 in huge numbers, perhaps in even greater ones than recently./nAs fans continue to stream (and even buy) 1989 and its many hit songs, they add to its growing total, and they may soon listen enough to give the album another platinum plaque. At the rate that 1989 and its singles are being played, the set could go diamond before 1989 (Taylor’s Version) drops in October./nIf, or more like when, 1989 does earn a diamond certification, it will mark Swift’s second album to collect that prize. Her sophomore set Fearless is already her biggest yet, sitting pretty at 10 million equivalent units shifted. Soon, 1989 may join it, making Swift one of a very small number of acts to collect more than one of these highly coveted awards./n",1.661496011,439,Achievements,1
440,Steve Scauzillo,Metro’s push for Taylor Swift concerts is seen as test for 2028 LA Olympics,LA Metro's response to six Taylor Swift concerts was a trial run for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.,https://www.dailynews.com/2023/10/02/metros-push-for-taylor-swift-concerts-is-seen-as-test-for-2028-la-olympics/,dailynews,general,us,2023-10-03T00:29:49+00:00,FALSE,TRUE,440,"LA Metro’s enhanced response during the six August days of Taylor Swift concerts at SoFi Stadium is being examined as a test for a much bigger event — the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games./nDuring the pop singer’s concerts from Aug. 3 through Aug 9, a rollout of shuttles, more frequent city buses and late-night rail lines running until 2 a.m. resulted in a 25% overall increase in ridership, Metro reported. The K (Crenshaw) Line increased by 250%, the C (Green) Line by 35% and stadium shuttle passengers carried 30,000 people to and from the Inglewood stadium./nWhile Metro touted its success at a recent committee meeting, two things became clear if Metro is going to succeed in making the L.A. Olympics carless during 16 days from July 14 to July 30, 2028. First, providing extra transit is costly. Second, any response requires a nimble operation able to meet fluid demands through coordination./nIt cost Metro around $660,000 to help Swifties get around without driving for six days in August, the agency reported. And Metro operations had to shift on a dime when the pop singer extended concerts scheduled to end at 11 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. That meant trains and shuttles had to run even later, for example./n“The only certainty is uncertainty,” said John Gordon, director of social media and marketing at Metro, during an assessment of the effort at a Metro committee last week. “There were a lot of needs for us to react to in real time. These are live events and conditions change.”/nFor concert-goers, Metro renamed stations for six nights. The Hawthorne/Lennox C Line Station had new signs that read “Taylor Nation Station.”/nBut Gordon said Metro needed more wayfinding signs, especially directing fans after the concert to the Metro shuttle going back to the train stations. Some social media comments were about getting lost or not finding the correct shuttle bus after the show./n“Other things we can do is help people establish where they got off, and so when they come out of the concert they are able to remember. We should take a cue from Disney and say, ‘I parked in the Goofy lot,’ ” he said./nGordon said because there were multiple shuttle operators, it caused confusion for people seeking the Metro shuttles back to the train stations./n“Many were not regular riders of our network. We needed signage to help people,” said Joseph Forgiarini, Metro senior executive officer for service development./nShuttle drivers and Metro city bus operators needed to know the best routes to take and to avoid end-of-concert traffic from 60,000 concert-goers each night. Coordination with SoFi’s bus drop-off and pick up facility was critical, Metro reported./nMetro also cited communication with Swift’s concert operations team to predict attendance and the concert’s start and finish times. Assessing the “transit demand” is something that must be known during the Olympics as well, Metro staff said. “We could gain a lot of information from venue management,” Forgiarini said./nMetro received criticism for not running shuttles, late-night trains and extra city buses during the three nights when Beyoncé played the arena, Sept. 1. 2. and 4. Metro staff said they were told that SoFi did not operate its inter-modal bus shuttle facility on those nights, so Metro could not add its own shuttles and extra service./nInglewood Mayor and Metro board and committee member James Butts said Metro just needed to ask his office to open the SoFi bus facility. “If you ever want our inter-modal (facility) open, all you have to do is call us,” he told Metro staff during the meeting./nThe Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies will take place at SoFi Stadium, so keeping all transportation systems operating, and keeping communications open with Metro, will be key during the Olympics./nAnother issue was getting riders to use the TAP app or Apple Pay to load fares before they arrive at a station or venue. Waiting for someone to load their TAP cards or phones with cash to pay the $1.75 fare for a train or bus causes long backups./nMetro CEO Stephanie Wiggins emphasized that traffic control in and around the venues was key. Some called for a dedicated bus lane into downtown Inglewood./nInglewood is rushing to build a 1.6-mile automated transit system, also known as a people mover, from the K (Crenshaw) Line to the stadium, to help with access from Metro train lines. The Inglewood Transportation Connector will run from K Line’s Downtown Inglewood Station to SoFi Stadium, the Kia Forum, Hollywood Park and the Los Angeles Clippers’ future Intuit Dome. The people mover is slated to break ground in 2024 and be completed in 2028./nMetro board and committee member Ara Najarian remembers the 1984 L.A. Olympics. He said that after the games many stayed to trade pins or buy merchandise or food. That kind of lingering creates a different challenge for transit agencies, he said. “People would come and stay a long time after the event. You might not have that intense crush you had with Taylor Swift,” he said./nStuart Waldman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association, serves on the L.A. 2028 Olympic Games Committee. He’s attended many Olympics and World Cup soccer events in cities throughout the world. At the Rio Olympics, he remembers a venue area with several big TV screens showing medal ceremonies and highlights from other contests./n“You want to keep people happy. And you want to communicate with people,” Waldman said on Monday, Oct. 2./nHe agreed that Metro needs to keep practicing transportation controls at large events as run-ups to the Olympics. Getting people to ride transit will reduce congestion./n“In many cases, there is just not parking to handle that amount of people,” Waldman said. “If you tell a neighborhood you are going to have a lot of people and cars, those neighborhoods don’t want that.”/nThe LA28 Olympic website recently posted renderings of a temporary sports park in the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area that would host equestrian, shooting, and canoe events during the games.

A re-recording is when a music artist or group records a new version of a song that was previously released./nVeteran music attorney Josh Karp, who has seen the new restrictions in the UMG contracts, told Billboard that he tried to get rid of it entirely. “I was just like, ‘What is this? This is strange. Why would we agree to further restrictions than we’ve agreed to in the past with the same label?'”/nThis change represents a departure from the long-standing norm in music contracts. Artists are typically required to wait for five to seven years from the initial release or two years after the contract expires to re-record their music./nIt’s worth noting that re-recording restrictions have been in place for decades; however, they have only recently come into the spotlight because of Taylor Swift (which we’ll expand on below). The limitations are meant to stipulate that an artist cannot re-record a song while they are still under contract with a particular label or within a specific period after their contract ends. This is to maintain exclusivity with the original recording./nGLENDALE, ARIZONA - MARCH 17: Editorial use only and no commercial use at any time.  No use on ...

(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)/nRecord labels also make substantial investments in the artists they sign, and their music catalogs are considered valuable assets. As a result, they employ various strategies to safeguard these investments and minimize risks, such as time restrictions, exclusivity clauses and more./nHistorically, artists would re-record only a handful of their most significant hits — or maybe their biggest albums decades later. But in the case of Taylor Swift, re-recording her catalog is about ownership and not so much about nostalgia — although she manages to achieve both./nSwift’s masters (her first six albums) were purchased in 2019 by Scooter Braun — a move that Swift says occurred behind her back. They were eventually sold to Shamrock Capital for $300 million in 2020. In response, the 33-year-old decided to re-record her first six albums and add “Taylor’s Version” at the end of each title so fans could distinguish between the re-recordings and the originals. She also signed a historic deal with Universal Music Group that would give her complete ownership over songwriting and the recordings, ultimately boosting her earnings in the long run./nThe pop star’s efforts greatly paid off. Forbes named Swift a billionaire in October 2023. A whopping $500 million of Swift’s fortune derived from music royalties and touring, while another $500 million came from the rising value of her music catalog.

""It's so ugly. It's like the ugliest thing you could ever imagine. I was wondering if it was any good when we got engaged. I was like, 'Let me go take a look at that' and I was like 'Nope.'

It seems like a paws-itively perfect partnership. I would love to know, what sparked your passion for animal advocacy? /nI genuinely have never not had a dog. I love animals so much and I've always had a pet in my home and that's something that I will continue, I think, for the rest of my life. Animals provide such a beautiful peace. It's like a puzzle piece that's missing until you have one and you don't even know how much they can enrich your life and how rewarding it is —especially to adopt an animal and watch their personality change and become more comfortable and more quirky and happy. It's amazing. So partnering with Hill's Pet just felt so natural because their mission is just beautiful and I just can't believe all the amazing work they've done over the years housing over 13 million cats and dogs through the Clear the Shelters campaign. So I'm very, very honored that they wanted me to partner with them and come volunteer today to help take some photos of these dogs to get them adopted./nMORE: Did you know these stars were besties?
/nIs Fabel your first rescue or had you rescued other pets before?/nFabel is technically my first rescue, but my fiancé and I have a dog named Jesse James, who was technically Steven's dog, but now he's of course our dog, but he's also a rescue as well. /nWhat breed is Fable? /nThis is a funny one because I was like ""What is she?” She has kind of a Border Collie face, but also like a Siberian Husky body and like all these- she could be a shepherding dog like I don't know. So we bought the DNA kit and we did it and we're like, ""Oh my God, we're so excited. Like what is she gonna be? Oh my God, we can't wait to find out!” And then we got the results back and it was so disappointing because it just said 100 percent Eastern European village dog and we were like, ""What does that mean? What does that even mean?” So we googled it and it turns out that it's like, it's just all these different breeds like Siberian Husky, Border Collie. It could be anything and I was like, ""We paid $200 for this”... We were like, ""Okay, great. We could have told you that.”/nYou've no doubt have changed Fable's life by rescuing her. So I'm curious, how has Fable changed your life?/nOh my God. I mean, I'm such an animal lover. When I first met Fable, I was volunteering at a shelter in Romania. I just missed my dog Jesse at home and I was wanting to play with some dogs and get some dog energy and Fable immediately broke my heart. You could just tell she was really sad. She needed some TLC in her life. And so having her and watching her blossom into this funny dog that's happy … she was so petrified of dogs when we first got her, now she loves dogs. It's so rewarding and so fulfilling. She's changed my life because I feel like she's so much happier and I'm so much happier because of that. Like her successes are my successes. I'm so proud of her and how far she's come and she's got a long way to go in terms of like comfortability and her anxiousness, but like I think she's perfectly imperfect. That's what makes her so great is that she has her own personality. Dogs always provide such a beautiful perspective on life. They're such simple, loving creatures and they're innately so good-hearted. Even if you meet an aggressive dog, chances are they are innately good, they're just scared. You have to just be patient. Animals are innately good./nMORE: All about celebrity pets
/nWill Fable and Jesse James have roles at your wedding?/nOh my God, I wish. Those two are way too anxious to be around that many people. I wish so badly, but Jesse James especially, if there's more than like 10 people in the room he's like, ""Alright, I'm putting myself to bed. This is too much.” And Fable- I don't even know if they would know where to look… But in our hearts, they will be at our wedding and part of our wedding. /nHow's the wedding planning going? Are you done, halfway there?/nIt's going very well. I have not found the process to be too stressful, but I also have to credit that to our amazing wedding planners Alison Bryan Destinations. They're the best. But I have to say, I've kind of enjoyed the stuff that people were like ""That's gonna stress you out.” At the end of the day, I'm planning what's supposed to be one of the most loving parties of my life./nRELATED: The biggest celeb wedding of all time?/nYour bridesmaids must love that it's not stressful, because then it is not stressful for them!/nExactly! I only have… only my sisters. That's it. That's all I'm having. So I only have two. /nI saw you had your bachelorette party. What was a highlight for you?/nOh man. It's mean, but it's not mean. My sister threw up and it was really funny. She drank too much wine, and then we got in the car and then I took a photo of her on the airplane with her sunglasses on. She now thinks it's funny, so it's okay to laugh at it. But also just getting together with my best pals, and my sisters planned the most detailed, beautiful weekend. They put so much thought into it. I felt so loved. My sisters planned it so well. It was just thing after thing after thing: games, wine tasting, dinner. We had so much going on and it was the most relaxing, loving weekend with some of my favorite people in the whole world. /nHow would you describe yourself as a bride?/nI would describe myself as someone who initially says they don't have a lot of opinions and then when presented with options all of a sudden has tons of opinions. I'm one of those people where I'm like, ""Yeah, like I'm pretty easygoing” and then like I realized, I'm like ""Maybe I'm not so easygoing, actually.” /nDid you have that idea already in your mind or did you go in open-minded?  /nI did not have lots of ideas. I had a Pinterest board that I made when I was young and it's disgusting. It's the ugliest thing you could ever imagine. I was wondering if it was any good when we got engaged. I was like, ""Let me go take a look at that” and I was like ""Nope.” So I created a new one. But honestly, I was open because I knew that like, you know, it's a little complicated. It's not so cut and dry, you can get everything you want. There's a lot of things that go into the vendors that you choose and chances are someone's gonna have something beautiful that you mesh with and you vibe with. /nWhat would you say you're most looking forward to on your wedding day?/nMarrying Steven! He's the best./nSwitching gears…You joined Taylor Swift onstage at her Eras Tour. Can you talk to us about that experience?  /nIt was pretty amazing. I've never experienced anything like that. It was incredible to be there and to experience all that energy on stage. I was saying, the best way to describe it is like it's like when you get into an ice bath. It literally takes your breath away for a moment. It's like such a shock. Like that's how it felt when I walked on stage. It was like such a shock. And so exhilarating just having all those people. It's such a niche thing to experience, but I really soaked in every second. It was incredible. /nOn Instagram after that night, you wrote that Taylor has been a huge figure in your life since you guys met when you were nine. Had you guys kept in touch ever since you appeared in the ""Mean” video?/nWe have. You know how friends who travel a lot, you have very long stretches where you don't talk all the time at all, but like she's so lovely. She's always made it a priority to check in and it's so lovely. And I just feel very lucky to have been able to be part of the Speak Now (Taylor's Version) era. And having that history when I worked on the music video ""Mean” with her. It's incredible to see how I've changed as a person and to see how she's changed. She's a magical person… She's just dominating right now. She's absolutely on top of the world, but the best part about her is that she just genuinely loves what she does and you can see that in everything she does. She's a true master of her craft and she like loves her fans. It's beautiful./nYou also reunited with Taylor Lautner for the ""I Can See You” music video. How hard was it to keep that a secret?/nOh man. Yeah, that was tough. That was exciting… very, very exciting. I shot that like in between something I was doing and it was just so much fun to be able to go and do that with her. Like you said, it was like you're like bursting at the seams. You can't wait for it to come out. But luckily I didn't have to wait too long. It came out in July, so I was excited. I was excited to be able to see it pretty quickly afterwards given how long things often take. /nTRENDING: Did you know who this famous star's husband is...?
/nDid your sisters know or your fiancé? Did you let them in on the secret or were they equally surprised when it dropped? /nNo, they knew! They did know. They were like the only people I told though, like genuinely, because I didn't want it to like get out or anything, but my sisters and my man, I was like ""Okay guys, gather around and don't tell a soul.” Those people are the only people that really had to know because well Steven was with me, but then the other two, they have my location and they're like where are you?/nWill there be Taylor Swift music at the wedding?/nI mean, duh, right?... It wouldn't be a party without T.S. music./nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity./n",-19.8356664,444,Unrelated,0

The city, not so much./nNow, Santa Clara is issuing a $2,000 fine against Pyrotek, the pyrotechnics company used by Swift, for setting off the fireworks after 11 p.m./nThe city has an 11 p.m. curfew for concerts at Levi’s Stadium, but Swift ended her show at 11:38 p.m. on Friday and 11:26 p.m. on Saturday, capping off her three-and-a-half-hour show with her hit song “Karma” from her 2022 album “Midnights” and a stream of fireworks behind her./nIn an email, Santa Clara spokesperson Michelle Templeton said city staff is also reviewing whether there will be any other fines levied for the curfew-breaking show. But even if haters gonna hate, Swift herself will shake it off as it is the San Francisco 49ers — who manage the stadium for non-NFL events — who pay curfew-related fines, not the artists themselves./n“Any noise ordinance violations will be determined after a post-event review of recorded noise levels and noise complaints,” Templeton said. “Compiling this information may take a couple weeks.”/nShe said that previous concert fines for noise and curfew violations have ranged from $750 to $2,100. The Santa Clara Police Department’s dispatch didn’t receive any noise complaints for either of Swift’s concert dates, Templeton noted./nBut while the jury is still out on whether the 49ers will incur a fine on Swift’s behalf, the city is taking action against Pyrotek for violating its permit by setting off fireworks after 11 p.m. The pyrotechnics company, which has done work for other artists such as Jennifer Lopez and the Jonas Brothers, will be fined $2,000 — $1,000 per night. Members of the Pyrotek team could not immediately be reached for comment./nThe curfew at Levi’s Stadium has been a point of contention for years. In 2021, the Santa Clara City Council voted to extend weeknight curfews for five shows a year from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. The weekend curfew for Friday and Saturday, however, remained at 11 p.m./nWhile the city is still weighing whether or not to fine the 49ers over the curfew, Mayor Lisa Gillmor asserted that the team will be fined./n“These neighborhood protections were agreed to by the 49ers and the city as conditions of development of the stadium,” Gillmor wrote in an email. “It was a compromise for building a stadium near residential areas. Keeping in mind that it takes approximately two to four hours after an event to clear the stadium, these protections are reasonable for our residents.”/nA spokesperson for Levi’s Stadium said in a statement that they are “focused on what’s actually important here —The Eras Tour brought millions of dollars in economic impact to Santa Clara’s local businesses, residents, and working families, and entertained more than 100,000 fans. We’re grateful Taylor Swift chose to perform at Levi’s Stadium and can’t wait to welcome other major artists to our community in the coming weeks.”/nCouncilmember Suds Jain didn’t weigh in on whether the city should issue the 49ers a fine but said he would be open to looking at a change in the weekend curfew./n“If we can get these big shows and make some money for the city, it’s something the city could look at,” he said./nRelated Articles

Prices start at $19.89 for adults and $13.13 for children, substantially less than what fans paid for the tour itself — especially on the robust secondary market — as the concert industry adjusts to sometimes prohibitively high costs for its biggest events./nSwift, 33, wrapped this year’s North American dates with four shows in Mexico last week. Her downtime, though, will be brief. In addition to the movie version of the concert, the singer will release “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” the fourth of rerecorded original albums, two weeks later, on Oct. 27. By November, the Eras Tour will pick up in Argentina before traveling around the world in 2024, with dates — including nine additional U.S. shows — continuing into November 2024./n“1989 (Taylor’s Version),” the new edition of her 2014 pop blockbuster, marks Swift’s seventh release in barely three years, a period of artistic productivity that has fueled pent-up, post-pandemic demand for the singer’s live show. Jon Caramanica, a critic for The New York Times, said in a review of the first concert in March that the Eras Tour put on display “how many pivots Swift has undertaken in her career, and how the accompanying risks can have wildly different consequences.”/nThe trade publication Pollstar has estimated that the singer sold about $14 million in tickets for each show so far.

However, one thing that fans can count on is that each night of the Eras Tour, Swift selects two songs from her catalog to perform acoustically, one on the guitar and one on the piano. With her six Los Angeles concerts come 12 new surprise songs./nIt’s an intimate moment between Swift and her fans, with rare guest appearances, where she strips down a song to just the lyrics and the chords./nSo far Swift has performed 93 different surprise songs throughout her U.S. dates. After promising fans that if she messes up a song and has to restart it, it’s fair game for her to perform as a surprise song at another venue, she performed “Clean” from 1989 for a second time./nAlso see: Taylor Swift’s 6 SoFi Stadium Shows: What you need to know before you go/nFans have taken it upon themselves to track each of the surprise songs as they go either through making a series out of it on TikTok, creating a website or taking to social media to place bets on which songs they thing she’ll perform that evening and what their punishment will be if she does./nHere’s the breakdown of surprise song possibilities left for the LA shows from each of Swift’s 10 albums:/nTaylor has performed all of the songs from 1989 during the first leg of her tour. The final song she performed from the album was New Romantics on August 9 after announcing that 1989 (Taylor’s Version) would be her next re-recording. The album will be released on October 27, 9 years to the date after the original album was released./n1989 TAYLORS VERSION OUT OCTOBER#LATSTheErasTour #TSTheErasTour #TaylorSwift #1989TaylorsVersion #1989tv pic.twitter.com/Lbkqn3hc4g/n— Carolyn Burt (@CarolynBurt_) August 10, 2023/n/nSwift has also performed some songs that she wrote exclusively for movie soundtracks including “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” from “Fifty Shades Darker” and “Today Was a Fairytale” from “Valentine’s Day.”/nNote: This list does not include songs from Swift’s Christmas album or those that she flubbed during the original surprise song performance./nAnd for curious fans who want to know what surprise songs have already been played while not spoiling the official set list, her’s a breakdown of when she played each surprise song and any special guests she had.",3.009915479,449,Tour,0

452,Kyle Buchanan,Taylor Swift ‘Eras Tour’ Movie: 4 Takeaways,There’s something in the singer’s highly anticipated new concert documentary for newcomers and superfans alike.,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/movies/taylor-swift-eras-movie-takeaways.html,The New York Times,entertainment,us,2023-10-12T14:10:58+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,452,"Advertisement/nSupported by/nThere’s something in the singer’s highly anticipated new concert documentary for newcomers and superfans alike./nBy Kyle Buchanan/nReporting from Los Angeles/nAs she greeted the audience at the premiere of her new movie, Taylor Swift sounded a bit sheepish./n“You’re stuck with me, because I’m going to sit with you and watch this thing,” she told the crowd at the packed premiere of “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” held at the sprawling Grove shopping complex on Wednesday night. Well, one of the crowds, anyway: Thirteen of the theaters at the Grove’s AMC multiplex were filled with eager fans, and Swift stopped by all of them to give a special introduction, eventually settling into an auditorium’s audience that included stars like Adam Sandler and Julia Garner./nRegular moviegoers can only hope that an apologetic Swift shows up for more house calls as her concert documentary makes its way into theaters this week. Though it was originally set for release on Friday, Swift just announced that the film will begin screening one day early because of fan demand./nStill, even if they can’t watch “The Eras Tour” alongside the singer herself — who came to the premiere in a pale blue Oscar de la Renta gown and danced in her seat for most of its running time — the movie is poised to deliver in a major way./nFor theatrical exhibitors, whose business has been in jeopardy since the actors strike scuttled plans to release tentpole movies like “Dune” this fall, “The Eras Tour” is being likened to the second coming of Barbenheimer: It’s got the grab-your-besties-and-go appeal of “Barbie,” the shock-and-awe soundscape of “Oppenheimer” and the box-office tracking to rival them both. Bullish film analysts expect an opening weekend between $150 to $200 million, meaning “The Eras Tour” has a shot at taking this year’s box-office tiara from “Barbie,” which notched a $162 million debut./nIn the meantime, here are four of the takeaways from the premiere./nIf fans are looking for insight into how Swift put her show together, or what was going on in her life behind the scenes, they won’t find it in “The Eras Tour”: There is no additional embroidering in this concert documentary, which was culled from Swift’s six-night August stint at the SoFi stadium in Inglewood, a suburb of Los Angeles. For those who caught one of the 53 shows Swift played in North America this past year, or for the fans hoping to see Swift in her remaining American dates (an international tour begins in February), this film is more or less the same thing as buying a concert ticket./nThere’s one crucial difference, of course: No stadium seat could offer as close a look at Swift’s performance as this documentary, which is vigorously shot and directed by Sam Wrench. And since the 33-year-old singer designed “The Eras Tour” as a journey through the shifting musical genres of her past 10 albums — from the country-pop “Fearless” all the way up to the recent, stripped-down records “Folklore,” “Evermore” and “Midnights” — this film is the closest thing that exists to a definitive document of one of the world’s biggest performers./nIn that way, it’s perfect viewing for newcomers and superfans alike: Curious people who were unwilling to shell out for tour prices can now check out Swift at a reduced rate, while Swifties who’ve already attended the concert can relive it in a compelling close-up. My teenage niece, who went to one of the SoFi shows, accompanied me to the premiere and was thrilled by the better look at Swift’s facial expressions and choreography. I noticed that hardly a song goes by without some big smiles from Swift and her backup singers: There’s enough joy on these faces to power entire blocks of Barbie Land./n“The Eras Tour” runs a robust two hours and forty-eight minutes, and though that’s nearly as long as “Oppenheimer,” Swift’s real-life concerts during this tour were even more mammoth, typically clocking in just shy of three and a half hours. Do fans have reason to fear there have been major cuts to the set list?/nBy my count, only a handful of her regular songs go missing on the way to the big screen, including “The Archer,” “Cardigan,” “Wildest Dreams,” and “no body no crime,” which Swift performed at SoFi with the band Haim./nStill, fans will get plenty of bang for their buck, since Swift performs nearly 40 songs during the movie, including a 10-minute version of “All Too Well” and two other bonus tunes, “Our Song” and “You’re On Your Own, Kid,” that Swift plucked from a rotating selection of surprise songs during her tour. And another trim is sure to be appreciated: Swift now moves between the different eras and costume changes in the blink of an eye onscreen, eliding all the time those segues took onstage./nBlockbuster premieres have been hard to come by since the actors strike began, and an eclectic cross-section of celebrities turned out for the “Eras Tour” premiere, including Sandler, Mariska Hargitay and the singers Maren Morris and Hayley Kiyoko. Fashion choices ran the gamut from silver sequins to cowgirl fringe, and Alex Atallah, a co-founder of the NFT marketplace OpenSea, entered the theater lobby sporting the colorful, tie-dyed “I Am Kenough” hoodie seen on Ryan Gosling in “Barbie.”/n“I have very few shirts with this many pastel colors,” Atallah told me before posing for a photo with the “Barbie” co-star Simu Liu./nNearby, I caught Flavor Flav deep in conversation with Swift’s father, Scott. Though they made for an unlikely duo, the 64-year-old rap icon is no fly-by-night fan: He said that he’d seen the “awesome” Swift on two previous tours./n“I’ve been a Swiftie for the longest, bro,” Flav insisted./nBut Swift’s biggest invite was reserved for another A-lister (and no, it wasn’t her new beau Travis Kelce, busy with a football game the next day): Before the premiere began, Swift dined and posed for pictures with Beyoncé, who has her own concert movie “Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé” due for release on Dec. 1. Like “The Eras Tour,” Beyoncé’s film bypassed traditional Hollywood studios and will be distributed by AMC Theaters./nThough she’s a superstar in the music industry, Swift’s forays into film haven’t been as well-received. Her last three movie credits as an actress include the minor young-adult drama “The Giver,” the memorably cataclysmic adaptation of “Cats,” and last year’s David O. Russell-directed “Amsterdam,” which coaxed Swift to pop in for a quick cameo and then promptly ran her over./nUnlike Lady Gaga, who has lately toggled between music and movies in equal measure, Swift has treated Hollywood as more of a side hustle, only committing to the occasional supporting role. But last year, after she signed a deal with Searchlight to write and direct an upcoming original film, eyebrows were raised all over town: Was Swift ready to take her movie career a bit more seriously?/nIt remains to be seen whether Swift will star in her feature directorial debut, but “The Eras Tour” still supplies her with some much-needed big-screen juice. A fun presence in her biggest numbers, like the bouncy “Shake It Off” and rocking “Look What You Made Me Do,” Swift is even more appealing in acoustic numbers that trade busy choreography for simple guitar playing. And in the centerpiece song “Tolerate It,” she shows acting chops during a well-choreographed routine about a dinner date gone wrong: It begins with her beseeching an inexpressive lover and ends with her swatting a vase of roses off the table./nHer real talent, though, is selling humility with a megawatt charisma that few celebrities can muster. Introducing one song, Swift insists she had to invent an outsized version of herself in order to write it: “In my fantasy, I’m not a lonely millennial woman covered in cat hair,” the singer says, even though she’s spent the whole film looking impossibly glamorous in sky-high Christian Louboutin heels./nAnd yet, you’re still tempted to believe her. What is that, if not a movie star?/nKyle Buchanan is a pop culture reporter and serves as The Projectionist, the awards season columnist for The Times. He is the author of “Blood, Sweat & Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road.” More about Kyle Buchanan/nAdvertisement",0,452,Filmography,0

News
/n/nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s rumored romance is causing chaos. After Taylor was spotted stepping out with Brittany Mahomes, Sophie Turner, and Blake Lively, Mahomes seems to have lost a friend. According to Page Six, Travis’ ex Kayla Nicole pointedly unfollowed her former close friend Brittany, along with Brittany’s husband Patrick Mahomes, and Mahomes’ brother Jackson, on Instagram. The outlet noted that Brittany, Jackson, and Patrick all still follow Kayla, despite the snub./nBrittany, Taylor, Sophie, and Blake had dinner together in New York in an epic girl’s night out on Friday, September 29. On Twitter, fans lit up with speculation over the apparent post-outing diss. “Kayla Nicole unfollowed Brittany Mahomes on Instagram after her dinner with T Swift.  I should not be proud to be this invested, but here I am,” confessed a fan. Another lamented via Twitter, “I’m so heartbroken over this.” /nOthers were more sympathetic to Kayla’s actions. “OOP! Kayla Nicole unfollowed Brittany Mahomes on insta. As she should! But Brittany still follows her,” a fan observed. /nKayla and Brittany, the wife of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, were famously close pals prior to the incident. In fact, Kayla was a bridesmaid at Patrick and Brittany’s lavish wedding celebration in Hawaii in March of 2022. Kayla and Travis had a rocky, on-off relationship beginning in 2017 and finally ending for good in May of 2022./nAt the time of their split, it was alleged that the on-air sports reporter was forced to pay for “half of everything” during the relationship, despite the NFL star’s wealth. Travis, however, hit back at the narrative personally./n“Don’t buy into that s***,” he said during a January 2023 appearance on The Pivot Podcast. “I would never say that I was supporting her,” he continued. “She had a very financially stable life and what she was doing in her career.”/nHe also claimed to have helped her financially from time to time. “But you’ve got to be crazy if you’d think I would never helped or gave her a couple thousand to grab some food or she gave me some money to go get some food…. we were in a relationship for five years,” he added. “A hundred dollars here, a hundred dollars there wasn’t even thought about.”",0.914815009,460,Gossip,-1

Best friends. Sisters. Moms and dads and daughters. (The crowd was mostly female by a large margin.)/nSavannah Knapp, 17, came with her sister Sadie Knapp, 31, both of them from Los Angeles.

Kelce already proved his chops on the first “Philly Special” album and his gruff baritone fits the song well. /nAs for Travis Kelce, even though he predicted on the podcast that he will “get just absolutely butchered” for his singing, he stays in key and definitely doesn’t embarrass himself. The duo even nails some harmonies./nAll of which leads to the most obvious question of all time: Is there a Tayvis duet in our future?

This time, it’s not just for her music, but for her incredible generosity towards the hardworking crew members of her Eras Tour. Swift has decided to show her appreciation to the dedicated truck drivers who have been instrumental in the success of her tour by surprising them with life-changing bonuses of $100,000 each./nGoing Above and Beyond/nTaylor Swift’s Eras Tour has been a massive success, captivating audiences across the United States. Behind the scenes, a dedicated team of professionals works tirelessly to ensure that everything runs smoothly. Among them are the tour’s truck drivers, who play a crucial role in transporting the stage and structure to each concert venue. These drivers, often away from their families for weeks at a time, work long hours in demanding conditions./nRecognizing their hard work and sacrifice, Taylor Swift wanted to express her gratitude in a truly meaningful way. In a surprise meeting during what the drivers thought was a routine production meeting, Swift’s father, Scott Swift, made an unexpected appearance. He revealed that Taylor had decided to give each trucker a bonus of $100,000, an amount far beyond the standard expected bonus of $5,000 to $10,000. This gesture not only exceeded expectations but also had a profound impact on the lives of these hardworking individuals./nLife-Changing Generosity/nFor the truck drivers who have dedicated their time and energy to the Eras Tour, the $100,000 bonus is truly life-changing. Michael Scherkenbach, the founder and CEO of Shomotion trucking company, which is one of two transportation companies used by the tour, described the impact of this unexpected windfall. He explained that these men and women live on the road, sleeping during the day and working all night. The grueling nature of their job means they often have to leave their families, including young children, for extended periods./nReceiving a $100,000 bonus opens up new possibilities for these hardworking individuals. It can serve as a down payment on a house or cover the cost of college tuition for their children. Scherkenbach emphasized that a fair wage alone would not provide them with such opportunities. Taylor Swift’s generous gesture has also given these truck drivers a chance to achieve financial security and fulfill dreams they might not have thought possible./nA Surprise Worth Waiting For/nThe truck drivers were completely taken aback when they were called into what they believed to be a routine production meeting. Little did they know that they were about to receive life-changing news. Scott Swift, accompanied by other members of the Taylor family, addressed the drivers and expressed their appreciation for their hard work and dedication. Taylor herself had personally written a handwritten note to each driver, sealed with her monogrammed wax seal. Inside each envelope was a check stating the amount of the bonus, along with the corresponding tax documents./nThe drivers, initially hesitant to look at the amount, were overwhelmed by the generosity they had received. Scherkenbach shared that one driver thought it said $1,000, another believed it was $10,000, and a third suspected it was a joke. However, the reality of the situation quickly sank in as they realized the magnitude of Taylor Swift’s gift. This unexpected bonus was not only a financial boost but also a testament to the appreciation and recognition they had earned through their hard work./nAcknowledging the Entire Team/nTaylor Swift’s generosity extended beyond the truck drivers. Other members of the tour crew, including those in catering, video, audio, and lighting, also received bonuses for their contributions. This comprehensive approach highlights Swift’s commitment to recognizing and valuing the efforts of every individual involved in making her tour a success./nThe positive impact of Taylor Swift’s generosity goes beyond monetary value. It creates a sense of camaraderie and appreciation within the tour’s crew, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment. This acknowledgment and gratitude not only motivate the team members to continue performing at their best but also set a shining example for the industry as a whole./nShe has shown her dedication to respecting the efforts of people in the background by being extraordinarily generous. The beneficial effect that Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour had on the lives of its devoted crew members will be remembered just as fondly as the wonderful music that was performed on the tour./nDuring what the drivers believed to be a routine production meeting, Taylor Swift’s father, Scott Swift, made a surprise visit.

Well played 👏🏻😂.”/nESPN First Take host Stephen A.

After days of swirling rumors that Kelce and Swift are dating, Swift’s appearance at the game instantly took over social media. Videos of Swift passionately cheering on Kelce—in one instance, appearing to yell “let’s f*cking go” after Kelce made a touchdown—went viral. Kelce had invited Swift to the game on Thursday during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show: “""I told her that I've seen her rock a stage in Arrowhead and she might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead,"" Kelce said. After the game, Swift and Kelce were spotted driving away together in his convertible./n“I’m not going to talk about my personal life,” Kelce said through laughs in an interview with NFL Network in August after being asked about Swift. “I know what you writers want to hear. And you want to hear more about that, and I’m not going to give you anything.”/nKelce first suggested he was interested in Swift in July, when he revealed on his New Heights podcast he made a bracelet with his phone number on it which he intended to give to Swift at her Kansas City Eras Tour stop. He didn’t get to meet her or give her the bracelet and joked that he “took it personal,” but praised the show. Speculation the pair may be dating ramped up after The Messenger reported last week they have been “quietly hanging out.” Some fans noticed Swift wore a necklace embedded with Kelce’s birthstone, an opal, while in New York on September 8, leading to speculation whether the necklace was a reference to their rumored relationship. Without mentioning Swift, Kelce said on Kristin Cavallari’s Let’s Be Honest podcast Tuesday it’s going to “take some time” to “really dive into a relationship with somebody.”/nSwift’s dating rumors with Kelce come months after she reportedly dated The 1975 singer Matty Healy for several weeks. The rumored relationship came under fire, both from Swift’s fans and otherwise, for Healy’s history of controversial comments, including remarks joking about rapper Ice Spice’s ethnicity and accusations he used the Black Lives Matter movement to promote his own music.

      Travis Kelce was already famous, but now he is learning what it means to be Taylor Swift-adjacent-famous.
  /n
      The new episode of his podcast, “New Heights,” which he hosts with his brother, fellow NFL football player Jason Kelce, dropped Wednesday.
  /n
      Jason Kelce introduced the TSwift of it all in the midst of some football talk by saying, “We’re here.”
  /n
      “We’ve been avoiding this subject out of respect for your personal life,” Jason Kelce, who plays for the Philadelphia Eagles said. “But now we gotta talk about it.”
  /n
      “My personal life that’s not so personal,” Travis Kelce quipped. “I did this to myself Jason. I know this.”
  /n
How the Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce connection started with a friendship bracelet
/n
      Jason Kelce then brought up Swift’s recent attendance at his brother’s game to watch his Kansas City Chiefs take on the Chicago Bears in Arrowhead Stadium. The superstar singer sat in a suite alongside the matriarch of the Kelce family and it pretty much broke the internet.
  /n
      After Jason Kelce asked his brother what his life is now like, Travis Kelce said he’s on the “roller coaster of life.”
  /n
      “I noticed a few things,” Travis Kelce said. “Paparazzi at my house. S**t like that.”
  /n
      The paps are there with cameras and screaming his name he said. His brother naturally asked about his special guest at the game. 
  /n
      “Shout out to Taylor for pulling up,” Travis Kelce said. “That was pretty ballsy.” 
  /n
      He hailed Swift who “looked amazing” and he said his friends and family had nothing but amazing things to say about her. Not to mention that his Chiefs won the game.
  /n
      “We script it all ladies and gentleman,” he (maybe) joked. “It was impressive.” 
  /n
Traylor is that you? Gaming couple nicknames for Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift 
/n
      Kelce said he found all the attention and excitement “hysterical.” 
  /n
      “It’s definitely a game I’ll remember,” he said. “That’s for damn sure.” 
  /n
      The brothers covered some more ground, including the sales of Travis Kelce’s jersey exploding post the Swift appearance, how everyone including football coaches have been talking about the possible couple and even how they drove off in his convertible after the game. 
  /n
      As to whether they are a couple or not we still don’t really know because Kelce chose to pass and left it as, “What’s real is that it is my personal life. I want to respect both of our lives.”
  /n
      Moving forward he will stick to talking about sports he said.

472,Jon Healey,Buying Taylor Swift tickets at the last minute? Make sure they're real,Scammers are taking advantage of the shortage of tickets and the eagerness of Swifties to defraud fans. Here's how to protect yourself.,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-08-07/buying-taylor-swift-tickets-at-the-last-minute-make-sure-theyre-real,latimesblogs,general,us,2023-08-08T01:16:33+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,472,"When it comes to buying last-minute tickets to see Taylor Swift at SoFi Stadium, don’t be the foolish one./nSometimes there are great deals to be had for buyers in the right place at the right time. But there are far more scammers looking for overeager fans than legitimate sellers willing to unload tickets at below the going rate./nIf money is no object, you can find tickets for any of the remaining sold-out shows in Inglewood through legitimate ticket brokers and resellers online, like StubHub, Vivid Seats and SeatGeek. These platforms offer money-back guarantees if your ticket turns out to not be valid (StubHub even pledges to try to get you in the door anyway and into a real seat). On Monday, for example, the least-expensive ones at StubHub.com were $843, and that was for seats in the upper deck or behind the stage./nAnd resale prices may come down more, if history is any guide. The New York Post reported that ticket reseller Vivid Seats saw prices for Eras Tour tickets in five other cities drop 50% at the last minute — although that’s 50% off the considerably higher resale price, not the original. /nNevertheless, hope springs eternal for ticketless Swifties, which is why you’ll find plenty of anecdotes online about tickets released at the last minute for sale at or below face value, or unloaded on the cheap by a desperate seller. And there are some groups out there dedicated to helping Swifties obtain tickets at face value or less — see, for example, @ErasTourResell on the social network formerly known as Twitter./nBefore leaping at an offer that seems to fulfill your wildest dreams, however, consider the advice from experts on how to avoid being sold a worthless fake./n Entertainment & Arts /nParking! Public transit! Fan chants! Friendship bracelets! Everything you need to know before you see Taylor Swift at SoFi Stadium for the L.A. stops of her Eras tour./nAug. 4, 2023/nThe most common piece of advice: Don’t buy a ticket directly from an individual whom you don’t know. It’s far safer to buy from a reseller such as StubHub, which offers protection against scammy sellers. But that protection comes at a premium price./nSimply buying through a third-party platform like a Facebook group or Craigslist isn’t enough, because the safeguards offered buyers vary from site to site. (And some, like Craigslist, don’t offer any because they’re simply advertising platforms, not ticket exchanges.) Worse, some scammers create fraudulent resale platforms to pull off their cons. /nNever trust a link to a site sent via text, email or social media; not only might the link take you to a webpage loaded with malware, it could also send you to an expertly crafted knockoff designed to look just like a well-known reseller’s site./nAs the U.S. Public Interest Research Group notes in its guide to avoiding ticket scams, “A scammer can, for example, create a website with the URL: TlCKETMASTER.COM Did you notice that URL contains a lower-case L and not an I? Betcha didn’t.”/nIf you’re willing to risk buying directly from a stranger, Step 1 is to make sure the ticket you’re buying is a valid Ticketmaster digital ticket, which is the only type of ticket that will grant you entry into SoFi. Ticketmaster’s website, however, offers no help on this front; it says flatly, “We can’t verify tickets bought from a third party.”/nWhat you can do is make sure the seller is offering you a ticket directly from a Ticketmaster account. That’s where all legitimate tickets reside, even the ones bought from resellers. /nSadly, many scammers know that too, and either offer a legitimate ticket that they don’t deliver or show a bogus Ticketmaster account page with a fake ticket or a screenshot of a real ticket./nHere’s an example from the Better Business Bureau’s scam tracking site, which is filled with stories from people who paid for Taylor Swift tickets but never received them. A person reported seeing an offer of four SoFi tickets for $600 on a Facebook group called “Waitlisted For The Taylor Swift — The Eras Tour Presale.” /n“I messaged her, and she showed what I thought was verifiable proof, a screen recording, of her Ticketmaster account with her name and the tickets,” the victim wrote. “After sending her the money for the tickets she wouldn’t transfer them to me, like she said she would, and also stopped responding to my Facebook messages.”/n Entertainment & Arts /nWhy are concert tickets so expensive and how can I get a cheaper ticket?/nAug. 21, 2023/nSo you’re going to need to turn up your skepticism dial and look out for common scammer techniques, including:/nIf you’re buying a ticket from someone in your community, do the transaction in person so that you can make sure the transfer happens, said Kevin Roundy, senior technical director at Norton. But the usual safety rules for in-person sales apply: pick a well-lit place filled with people, and don’t bring cash./nIf possible, pay with a credit card (not a debit card) because you’ll be able to get a refund if you’re defrauded. That’s not practical when buying from an individual, though, so in those cases, insist on a payment platform that offers “purchase protection” as an option, such as Venmo, PayPal and Facebook Marketplace, and then be sure the transaction is covered by it./nWhen looking at sellers on Facebook, remember that people will hack a Facebook account and use it specifically for the purpose of ripping off Swifties, Roundy said. He added, “If you’re a hacker and you wanted to monetize a hacked Facebook account right now, I couldn’t think of a better way.”/nAnother tip from PIRG: When buying a ticket, check the section and seat number on it to make sure it actually exists. /nRemember, you can’t buy a printed ticket for Swift’s Eras Tour. All transfers have to be done through Ticketmaster’s app or website. So if someone offers to sell you a paper ticket, walk away./n Entertainment & Arts /nPlenty of parking spots are still available for Swift’s shows, but not in the lots on the stadium grounds. For those, you’ll have to go through a reseller and pay even more./nJuly 28, 2023/nFinally, announcing on social media that you’re looking for tickets will make you a magnet for scammers. /nLongtime Taylor Swift fan Krista Smith illustrates this point, and a few other pitfalls faced her fellow Swifties. A native of Vancouver, Smith figured that while she was in Southern California for summer vacation, she might try to get last-minute tickets to the Eras Tour at SoFi. She watched ticket prices drop during the opening acts of Swift’s first concert here Thursday, sinking under her budget of $300. So she and a friend made plans Friday to head to the stadium, starting by posting in a few Swiftie Facebook groups that she was looking for day-of tickets./n“The first three people that messaged me were very obvious scammers,” Smith, 28, said. She said all three sent similar messages, all mentioning that they were desperate to get rid of their tickets — the first red flag./n“At this rate, no one is desperate,” she said. Other “sketchy” signs included asking for payments over PayPal as “friends and family,” instead of through the goods and services feature, which provides purchase protection./nShe was still hopeful they could snag tickets through an online, verified resale vendor, such as Vivid Seats or Stubhub, but even as the opening acts continued, prices didn’t fall — and seats were going fast./n“We would refresh pretty often, and as we were putting tickets in our cart, they’re selling,” she said. “We’re all dressed up, we’re ready to go inside. … It was desperate.”/nAt that point, Smith secured two tickets for about $1,400 — “Our budget kind of expanded when we got to the stadium,” she laughed — but they weren’t downloaded instantly and the seller wasn’t responding. Time kept ticking by. Swift took the stage, and Smith and her friend were still stuck waiting./nVivid Seats eventually refunded  them for the tickets, and the friends listened outside for a while, traded some friendship bracelets and bought some merch. /n“It’s ok,” said Smith, who has seen multiple Swift shows on previous tours before her sojourn in L.A. “I’ll watch the livestreams and get my fix that way.”/nTimes staff writer Emma Fox contributed to this report./nAbout The Times Utility Journalism Team/nThis article is from The Times’ Utility Journalism Team.

It also reveals an evolving Taylor Swift, exuding confidence.",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2023-10-12/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-review-movie,latimes,general,us,2023-10-12T19:25:24+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,477,"Taylormania has come to the multiplex./nTwo months after she completed the first leg of her globe-conquering Eras tour, Taylor Swift presided over the premiere of her new concert movie, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” on Wednesday night at the high-end Grove shopping mall in Los Angeles./nThe film, directed by Sam Wrench and shot in August during the 33-year-old pop superstar’s sold-out six-night stand at Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium, arrives at a characteristically busy moment for Swift, who’s got a new album due later this month in the form of “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” and who’s been traveling the country to watch her NFL player of a rumored boyfriend, Travis Kelce, do his thing on the field./nAnd yet to hear Swift tell it, she’s practically counting down the days till she gets back on the road for another round of shows./n“I’ve never had a fraction of the amount of fun I had on the Eras tour,” she told an audience at the Grove peppered with friends and fellow celebs. Times pop music critic Mikael Wood and Times film critic Justin Chang were in the house as well and compared notes afterward./nMIKAEL WOOD: Well, Justin, allow me to start by quoting Taylor Swift: “Welcome to the Eras tour!” Having seen Swift’s show three times — on opening night in Arizona and then twice at SoFi Stadium — I’m eager to hear how this pop extravaganza played onscreen for someone who hasn’t seen it in the flesh. Was its length exhausting to you? Did its nonchronological run through Swift’s catalog tell a discernible story? Could you grasp why she placed a fedora on a cute kid’s head at one point?/nFor our readers, I’ll say that “The Eras Tour” movie is a pretty straightforward depiction of the production Swift took to stadiums across the country this year; there’s no backstage footage, no documentary dressing, no talking-head voice-overs to explain what we’re witnessing. (There is a cute blooper reel at the end.) A few songs have been cut from the set list — among them, tragically, “The Archer” — to get the film’s run time under three hours, slightly. But if you’ve seen the Eras tour, you’ll recognize “The Eras Tour.”/nNow, a big part of the show in real life is the sceney-ness of it all: the fans in wild and creative outfits, the swapping of friendship bracelets, the many famous people who’ve turned up in various cities to watch Swift perform. And that  was the case too at the Grove, where decked-out Swifties milled around excitedly in the lobby before showtime, trading stories about how many tour dates they’d attended. For last night’s world premiere, something like 2,000 guests filled more than a dozen of the AMC building’s theaters; I was in the one where Swift herself took in the movie, surrounded by the backing vocalists from her road band and an assortment of celebrities including Adam Sandler, Maren Morris, Julia Garner, Simu Liu and former rich-guy L.A. mayoral candidate (and Grove mega-developer) Rick Caruso./nI have to admit I spent a fair amount of time watching the singer watch herself, and I can definitively say that Taylor Swift is all in on Taylor Swift. (Also: Sandler? Big “Reputation” guy.) But enough about the vibe. What did you make of “The Eras Tour” as, y’know, a movie?/nJUSTIN CHANG: I’ll answer that in a second, Mikael, right after I’ve cleared my head and shaken off the last vestiges of “Shake It Off” (a favorite of my 7-year-old daughter’s and thus a perennial household earworm). In all seriousness, Wednesday night’s premiere was a wonderfully deranged experience. It was exhaustingly long, at 168 minutes, yes, though given the show’s three-hour-plus run time, you have to admire the movie’s economy. Still, it didn’t help that our AMC theater had to stop and restart the movie 15 minutes in due to a distracting sound-sync issue. I’m glad they fixed it; for a while I feared that audio and video were never, ever, ever / getting back together./nAnyway, how’s the movie? This Taylor Swift nonexpert could hardly be less qualified to answer. At the same time, I have to imagine my reaction was not entirely dissimilar to that of anyone — even a die-hard Swiftie — encountering the show for the first time. Again and again, in between private stretches of partial tune recognition, my jaw dropped at the sheer visual grandeur of the thing: the dramatic shifts in setting and scale that can find Swift crooning gentle songs from “Evermore” at a fantastical moss-covered piano one minute and then diving into some kind of digitally confected pond the next./nMost of all, I gaped at Swift’s sheer physical and musical stamina, by which I mean not just the unflagging energy and sustained quality of her vocals, but also the staggering post-2018 artistic output that “The Eras Tour” encompasses. The COVID years were extraordinarily productive, transformative years for Swift, and both the show and now the movie tell the story of that transformation. And just as the tour, with its Ticketmaster-smashing success, has rejuvenated the music industry like nothing since before the pandemic, so the film looks poised to set the box office ablaze; it’s the “Barbenheimer” of pop-music juggernauts./nI’m curious, Mikael, having seen the Eras tour three times already, how was your fourth go-round? Did you, like me, enjoy the way the movie collapsed live and theatrical viewing experiences, the way all the dancing, light-waving people in our theater seemed to merge with all the dancing, light-waving people at SoFi Stadium? Those crucial missing songs aside, were there aspects of the movie that you feel diminished, or perhaps improved upon, the original?/nWOOD: I love your point about the merging of Swift’s two audiences because it’s true: Again and again on Wednesday night, I couldn’t tell where the crowd noise in the film ended and where the crowd noise around me began./nAs in the live show, Swift’s song “Cruel Summer” — a No. 3 hit on Billboard’s Hot 100 this week, more than four years after it came out — appears at the very beginning of “The Eras Tour,” and in my theater, at least, it had people singing along at full volume from the jump. Very “Rocky Horror Picture Show,” especially in the little moments when fans got to demonstrate their deep knowledge of Swift’s work — the bit in “All Too Well (10-Minute Version),” for instance, when they screamed “F— the patriarchy” along with her./nIs this rowdy interactive approach one way that Hollywood might hope to save the theatrical business? If nothing else, it’s sure to be a part of the Beyoncé concert film that will follow Taylor’s into theaters in December. I wonder how that prospect strikes a committed moviegoer like you, Justin. (Stray thought: The Grove was serving booze at the premiere, which no doubt helped loosen up some number of Swifties. How might “The Eras Tour” shape theater owners’ feelings on liquor at the multiplex?)/nYou asked whether the cinematic experience improved upon the real-life experience in any way. The answer is yes, and it came in the close-ups: You get to see the intricacies of the choreography in a song like “The Man,” where Swift and one of her dancers lay out a scene of casual boardroom sexism; you get to see the instrumental interplay between the singer and her band, as in a hoedown-ish take on “Fearless.”/nAnd you get to behold Swift’s acting: the way she flares her eyes at a certain point in “Champagne Problems” or her portrayal of a neglected partner in “Tolerate It,” which depicts an unraveling marriage with a level of detail I didn’t catch in any of the concerts I saw in person. Speaking purely in terms of her dramatic abilities, I don’t think Swift’s on a level with former Disney kid Olivia Rodrigo, to name one of her many musical inheritors. But there’s no doubting that those skills are what help hold together the vast tonal and stylistic range of her music. What did you make, Justin, of Taylor Swift, screen thespian?/nCHANG: “Champagne Problems” and “Tolerate It” are indeed melancholy highlights, and the raw anguish of the latter’s elaborate “Citizen Kane” homage surely registers more powerfully up close, I imagine, than it does from a distance. Here and elsewhere, Swift’s ability to project intimacy becomes the movie’s reason for being: You get the delirious sensation of being swallowed up by a massive crowd, up to a point, but then, in the space of a single cut, it’s suddenly just her alone onstage, all but bringing the performance directly to you. I felt that way watching her perform “You’re On Your Own, Kid,” a song that compacts so much painful history, but which Swift suffuses with a lightness and energy that feels bracingly optimistic./nThose moments aside, Mikael, what struck me most about Swift’s performance was her apparently unfeigned delight, her seemingly genuine pleasure at being there onstage in front of a gargantuan crowd, doing the most draining, all-consuming work of her career night after epic night. Early in the show she points her finger into the crowd and moves it around the entire stadium, conjuring an aural wave that you can practically feel traveling around the movie theater, before it finally surges in a seat-rattling surround-sound crescendo. The pleasure of the moment lies in how utterly tickled Swift seems by her own power, which can hardly be a surprise to her at this point. Somehow, she convinces you that it is./nAs the opposite of a committed concertgoer, I don’t mean to sound naive or to assume that this sort of effervescence is unique to Swift. Over the years, of course, her many critics have dismissed her as calculated and inauthentic — accusations that are par for the course, I think, for a female artist who gets anywhere near her stratospheric level of success. But authenticity has always been a tricky, even dubious concept in art, and one of the pleasures of “The Eras Tour” is the way it destroys the facile notion of a pure individual self. With its labyrinthine arc, jumbled chronology and dazzling changes of tone, milieu and costume, it’s Swift’s ode to invention and self-reinvention, the many different lives she’s lived and faces she’s presented over the course of her career./nOur audience certainly seemed to lap it up unreservedly, full of liquor and high on their own Taylormania. I can only imagine how that must have been with Swift herself sitting there in your theater, Mikael; I imagine watching Taylor Swift watch Taylor Swift must have been its own uniquely mesmerizing experience, to the point where sometimes even the big screen itself became an afterthought. Then again, as you noted, “The Eras Tour” is doing its damnedest to give movie theaters a badly needed shot of adrenaline.

It entrenches the idea of moviegoing as an exception, a rarity.

 Music is now the halftime sponsor, not Pepsi, there is not a (Pepsi/Diet Coke) advertising conflict precluding this from happening.

/nThe old adage “everything old is new again” rings true for music lovers. The industry saw a significant bump in vinyl sales over the first three quarters of 2023. Experts predict that the trend will continue into the final quarter of the year. Upcoming releases from acts like the Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift signal a “blockbuster” fourth quarter for vinyl purchasers./nData recently collected by Music Week shows a 12.4% increase in vinyl sales over the first half of 2023. However, Q3 showed the largest growth with a 15.1% year-on-year increase. A total of 3,952,262 vinyl LPs were sold between January and the end of September of this year./nA handful of incredibly popular acts are at the forefront of this increase in vinyl sales. Lana Del Rey, Blur, and Taylor Swift are leading the charge so far./n[RELATED: Lana Del Rey Praises Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish: “I Love Them and Their Music”]/nUnsurprisingly, Swift’s Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) moved the most units in Q3. The rereleased record sold 29,648 units. Lana Del Rey’s Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd is the top-selling LP on vinyl. It moved 33,568 units since its release in March. Additionally, Blur’s The Ballad of Darren sold 26,894 copies on vinyl this year./nReleases from Olivia Rodrigo, Wham!, Lewis Capaldi, and Kylie Minogue are also moving tens of thousands of vinyl units./nExperts believe that Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) and the Rolling Stones’ first album of new original music, Hackney Diamonds, will further drive vinyl sales in Q4./nAdditionally, Record Store Day Black Friday (November 24) is set to further boost the sales of vinyl in the final quarter of the year. The event will see more than 90 artists releasing limited edition vinyl LPs. Those artists include Post Malone, Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson, The Doors, and De La Soul, among others./nERA CEA Kim Bayley spoke to Music Week about the impact of Record Store Day and its Black Friday sister event on the popularity of vinyl. Bayley called RSD the “single most important catalyst” in the resurgence of the format./nHowever, this growing interest in vinyl LPs doesn’t signal a growth in physical music purchases overall. In fact, CD sales are down 6.3% year-on-year so far. Overall, physical media sales are down by 0.5%. It comes as no surprise that streaming and digital remain the music format of choice for the majority of listeners and continues to grow./nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)/nPhoto by Allen J.

How to land a job inside SoFi Stadium to see Taylor Swift,"In lieu of a seat at SoFi Stadium for the Eras Tour, you can try to get a job through an online temp agency handing out wristbands. And other gigs inside the building might pop up.",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-08-01/didnt-get-eras-tour-tickets-how-to-land-a-job-inside-sofi-stadium-to-see-taylor-swift,latimesblogs,general,us,2023-08-01T20:37:25+00:00,TRUE,TRUE,483,"Are you one of the countless Taylor Swift fans who waited in a queue for hours on Ticketmaster but still didn’t get any tickets? /nAlthough SoFi Stadium in Inglewood can accommodate 70,000-plus people, many Swifties find themselves unable to get seats for any of the Eras Tour’s six sold-out shows there./nSome enterprising fans have found another way into coveted concerts: By joining one of the temporary crews working on the show. And you don’t have to be a whiz at sound engineering, lighting or other technical field to join them — you just have to be 18 or older./nGig work apps have become more popular in recent years for filling temporary jobs in roles such as bartender, cashier and concessions, dishwasher, prep cook and event staff. /nThe good news for ticketless Swifties is that the hospitality staffing app Tend just released its Eras jobs list, and it’s looking for candidates. /n Entertainment & Arts /nParking! Public transit! Fan chants! Friendship bracelets! Everything you need to know before you see Taylor Swift at SoFi Stadium for the L.A. stops of her Eras tour./nAug. 4, 2023/nHere’s how to apply./nDownload Tend and create a profile. /nCreating a profile takes about five minutes. You’ll need a government issued-ID (a driver’s license will do), a phone number, email address, and home address to round out the profile. The app also recommends submitting a professional photo that reflects what you want to communicate to your employer. You must be at least 18 years old. /nAfter profile approval, complete the questionnaire for “Cashier/Concessions.”/nUnder the Application Hub section, go to “Quick Apply” and find “Cashier/Concessions.” Submit your responses related to your years of experience and type of event. It’s  OK if you don’t have any. But be honest. You should be approved within a few minutes to see open jobs. /nDecide whether you want to be part of the parking or wristband crew./nCurrently, there are two categories of jobs listed by Nowsta Talent, the staffing agency, for the Eras Tour: parking attendant and wristband crew. More types of positions may open up for the  L.A. concert dates. /nFor each concert date from Aug. 3 to 9, there are roughly 80 to 110 people needed for wristband crew to hand out LED bracelets that light up in sync with Swift’s performance. Read carefully before clicking apply, as only some wristband crew members will work during concert hours./nThe job pays $18.50 to $20.50 an hour, depending on your shift time. Transportation is not provided, so you’ll have to find your way to Inglewood on your own. And bring only a minimal number of items in a clear bag, as the agency does not have any space to store your personal belongings. /nApproximately 25 LAZ parking attendants per day will work from 1 p.m. to midnight  at lots that, judging from LAZ’s website, aren’t on the SoFi grounds. This job pays $18.25 an hour. You won’t be able to see the show, but you may have a chance to hear Swift sing (SoFi is an open-air stadium)./nAce the interview./nAfter submitting an application, wait for an interview. /nDemand is high, so you may not get a response if your profile does not match what employers are looking for. According to a Washington Post article, Taylor Swift tour jobs have received triple the usual amount of applications for concerts. Volunteer groups such as California Triathlon are also partnering with SoFi to staff concessions, so there are fewer slots now for gig workers. /nUnfortunately, you won’t get to wear your Eras Tour planned outfits because the attire will be all-black. Think of it as being in your Reputation era./nDo your job well. But also enjoy the ambiance as a Swiftie./nDon’t suddenly “run off to the bathroom” to sneak into the show and avoid your responsibilities. Many Swifties will be depending on you for a smooth concert experience. You’ll also be permanently banned from Tend if you abandon your post. /nOn the other hand, feel free to lip-sync along with the songs and enjoy the concert atmosphere. Getting into SoFi to work the show may not be as great as getting in with a ticket, but it beats not getting in at all. /nFollow Us/nHelen Li was a member of the 2022-23 Los Angeles Times Fellowship class.

In fact, that’s the kind of thing she probably gives out big cash bonuses for. But a security guard did get fired for his conduct at the Eras Tour—not so much for the singing along but for the viral video of him doing it./nThe security guard in question is one Calvin Denker, who has said he only applied for the gig so that he could attend the tour without paying for tickets (via NBC News). The problem with that plan was that security isn’t there to watch the concert, and his employer, BEST Crowd Management, has strict rules about security taking photos of the show. “After night one, I was realizing how close Taylor Swift was getting to me, so I really wanted to get a photo to document it,” Denker said in a TikTok video. “So I handed down these little pieces of paper that said I wasn’t allowed to have my phone out, but if Taylor Swift comes right behind me, please take a photo of me and text it to my number. And I handed this out to a couple of people in the front row for night two and they were really kind and really sweet about it.”/n@calvindenker My security job for Taylor Swift #theerastour #taylorswift #minneapoliserastour #greenscreen ♬ original sound - Calvin Denker/nIt’s a pretty clever ploy, you have to admit, and Denker ended up going viral for singing along to Swift’s track “Cruel Summer” with his back to the stage. “Every photo of me from that night was from behind the barricade like any other photo from a fan would be. I never took my own phone out,” he maintained in a follow-up TikTok. “And above all else, I made sure that Taylor Swift was safe and all the fans had a good time. As long as I was at that concert, I was doing my job.”/nUnfortunately, getting other people to take photos of him did not end up being the loophole Denker thought it was. “Long story short: I was fired for it,” he said in his TikTok, noting that “the main issue they had was with my follow-up video where I said I handed out pieces of paper to the people in front of me to ask to be sent any photos that I made my way into.” He added, “Beyond that, the HR woman who called me wasn’t able to articulate exactly what I did wrong, because I didn’t do anything beyond asking for photos, which is what happens at any other concert, with the only exception being that I made sure I got any that I was included in.”/nThere was apparently some confusion over whether this really was a fireable offense—Denker offered to take down his video, and he was scheduled for more shifts before the company ultimately gave him the boot. But “Please don’t go sending any hate to this company,” he said in his video. “I just wanted to update all of you because it was a very popular TikTok for me, so I wanted to let all of you know what had happened. I still got to work one of the coolest concerts ever, and I got to work it twice, so that is fantastic, and I hold no grudges against my employer.” If video evidence of singing along to “Cruel Summer” is wrong, then this writer doesn’t want to be right.",8.656452604,486,Unrelated,0

For people who couldn’t spend a chunk of cash on tickets, this was the next best thing: enjoying her music outside the venue’s walls, a practice that’s come to be known as Tayl-gating./nAhead of the Eras tour show at SoFi Stadium, however, the city of Inglewood’s message is Tayl-gating “wouldn’t be effective here.”/nMayor James T. Butts Jr. said SoFi Stadium is a quarter-mile away from the sidewalk area that rings the property. The closest is on Prairie Avenue, and “the sidewalk of Prairie is not wide enough” for people to gather. /nThe city already doesn’t allow people to block sidewalks, citing public safety concerns. If Swifties set up shop there, he said, they would be asked to move along./nAnd the chances of hearing Swift from Prairie Avenue would be slim.

As the name implies, it involves signing a player for 10 days, or about three games to either help out for a short period or prove themselves./nDespite Travis‘ offer to make his NBA debut, it seems like Mark clearly noticed how Taylor’s star power brought Swifties to the NFL. After the “Anti-Hero” singer was seen supporting her rumored beau at the Chiefs game, jersey sales for Travis shot up 400%, making him one of the top five selling jerseys in the league, per NPR. /nAfter the game, Travis gushed about the “Shake It Off” popstar on his New Heights podcast. “Everyone in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her,” he said. ” She looked amazing, everybody was talking about her in a great light.” New Heights is presented by Wave Sports + Entertainment./nBesides his compliment, the Super Bowl winner did admit that he wanted to respect their privacy going forward. “She’s not into media, like I am doing this show every single week and having fun during the NFL season on other guys’ shows. And any other show I go on from here on out — I am enjoying life, and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend. And so, everything moving forward, me talking about sports and saying, ‘alright nah’ is kind of have to be where I keep it [sic],” he said./n

The question now is -- will Taylor's in-game visits become a regular thing???/nWe know she and Trav hit the town in KC last week ... and their gallivanting caused quite a stir in the city. In this neck of the woods, though -- that'll be amplified by at least 10 ... with tons of paparazzi crawling all over the place, not to mention adoring fans left and right./nIf this does, in fact, become a tradition as these 2 explore their relationship ... you also gotta wonder if we'll see added PDA as time goes on. We already saw them cozying up during an after-party -- and now that the cat's outta the bag, perhaps more is on the horizon./nThere's been some speculation this all might be a PR stunt -- but now ... it feels real./nRemember, we were told Taylor's team is still working out security logistics for MetLife ... meaning, she won't be able to just slip in all casual-like the way she did last week./nWith all this in mind, it probably goes without saying -- if we happen see Taylor and Travis out and about at all this weekend ... it'll undoubtedly be another frenzy and then some./nKickoff can't come soon enough! 👀",5.950349171,491,Dating,0

From the ill-advised Pepto-pink jerseys that once permeated the NFL's online shop (seriously, why did it take so long to offer team-colored jerseys in a more flattering cut?), to a special page for women on the league website a little over a decade ago that promoted ""homegating"" with recipes, to the reported laughably small amount of money it actually donated to breast cancer-related charities during its once-vaunted and now-abandoned Pink October efforts, the NFL's attempts have been shallow at best, focused on stereotypes about women./nGiven what we've seen in recent weeks, it feels like little has changed in the NFL's approach, except the methods of pandering. Now the league can use social media channels like TikTok and Instagram, which have high percentages of younger female users./nAnd use them it will./nNow that Taylor Swift, one of the most recognizable women in the country, is involved with one of the league's biggest stars in Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce, the NFL and its broadcast partners are going overboard in trying to court Swifties, the singer's rabid fan base./nIn a lot of ways, it is thirsty and, well, shallow, though unsurprising. This is, after all, a sports organization that would put the opening of an empty paper bag in prime time on its in-house network if it could sell the ad time./nDon't take just my word for it either. Kelce and his big brother Jason also said the NFL is doing too much, saying so on the latest episode of their weekly podcast ""New Heights.""/nOn Sunday night, with Swift in attendance for her second straight Chiefs game, this the team's prime time matchup against the New York Jets, NBC showed Swift 17 times during the broadcast of the game, the Los Angeles Times reported. Seventeen times!/nOn Monday, the league's official feed on X, formerly known as Twitter, changed its header to three photos of Swift reacting to moments from Chiefs-Jets and switched its bio to a lyric from Swift's ""The Best Day.""/nThere are seven clips on the league TikTok feed that feature Swift, including a pinned one of she and Kelce holding hands after Kansas City's home win over the Chicago Bears in Week 3, the first game the Grammy winner attended. There are at least five photos or videos of Swift on the NFL's Instagram page./nBy Wednesday, with the fatigue mounting and criticism coming from the Kelce brothers, the NFL defended its over-the-top Tay-tention in a statement to People magazine./n""We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what’s happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,"" the statement said. ""The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we’ve leaned into in real time, as it’s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we’ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.""/nExcept this isn't really a ""pop cultural moment"" the NFL should be exploiting for its own gain. A pregnant Rihanna floating over the field at State Farm Stadium during the Super Bowl LVII halftime show earlier this year is a cultural moment. Beyoncé reuniting Destiny's Child for her Super Bowl XLII halftime show was a cultural moment. This is two people who might be just beginning a relationship. Yes, she's famous and increasingly he is too, joking with his brother on ""The Heights"" about the number of commercials he shot during the offseason that are now debuting during NFL games./nThe NFL, however, seems committed to squeezing everything it can out of this, capitalizing off of Swift's presence as she shows support for Kelce, seeing nothing but an opportunity to seize for its own gain and potentially grow its audience among younger women. The result of this force-feeding was 27 million in viewership, according to NBC, the most for a Sunday night game since the last Super Bowl. Much of that spike was a result of increased viewership from young women./nBut if this Swift-Kelce spectacle hadn’t occurred, what would the league be doing to court younger women?/nOne of these days the NFL might figure out how to get and keep women's attention without advice on how to throw the best ""homegating"" party or using a woman's budding relationship for social media fodder.

/n/nDavid Beckham isn’t impressed with the frenzy and speculation surrounding the rumored romance between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. The soccer icon and husband of former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham spoke out in support of the singer in new comments. “There’s a lot of noise around Taylor at the moment,” he said, obviously referencing the intense media attention generated by the hitmaker and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end./nBut despite Taylor’s public spotlight, David feels she deserves to have a chance at happiness. “Taylor is an amazing talent and she’s an amazing person, and she deserves to be happy,” he continued. “Whatever she does and whoever she’s with, as long as she’s happy, that’s the most important thing.”/nThe blonde singer and buff athlete first sparked rumors when Travis said he’d attempted to give Taylor his phone number on a friendship bracelet while attending the Eras Tour concert to Arrowhead Stadium on July 8th. “If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it,” he confessed during a July episode of his New Heights podcast./n“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” he said, hilariously admitting that he was “a little butt-hurt” that he didn’t get to visit with the beautiful singer. “She doesn’t meet anybody—or at least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal.”/nA matter of weeks later, the first reports emerged that the duo had begun “quietly hanging out.” “Travis has been into Taylor for a while and definitely has a crush on her,” a source reportedly told Entertainment Tonight for a September 12 report. “He is a simple guy that is very funny, charismatic, chill, and loves playing football.”/nSince then, Taylor has been seen cheering on Travis at multiple Kansas City Chiefs football games, even hanging out with his mom, Donna Kelce. Obviously, it’s drawn a vicious cycle of public interest. Which Travis realizes comes with the territory. “Look, I brought all this attention to me [sic],” the told brother Jason Kelce during a podcast episode. “I did the whole friendship bracelet thing and told everyone how butthurt [I was] that I couldn’t meet her — You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take!”/n /n

Over the weekend, the global superstar was spotted in a football stadium, cheering on the Kansas City Chiefs, specifically cheering on the tight end of the Chiefs, Travis Kelce. Swift's appearance at Sunday's game and the fact that she and Kelce left the stadium together blew up the internet. It seemed like everybody had something to say about the new it couple, even legendary Patriots coach Bill Belichick.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL BELICHICK: Travis Kelce has had a lot of big catches in his career.(LAUGHTER)BELICHICK: This would be the biggest.CHANG: As for Swifties, well, they seem to have embraced their queen's new boo.

And here to talk about this meeting of two super-fandoms is Nora Pinciotti, staff writer for The Ringer and major Swiftie herself. Hello.NORA PRINCIOTTI: Hello. Hello.CHANG: OK, Nora, for listeners who may not be following all the ins and outs of Taylor Swift's dating life, give us a brief timeline of the rumored Swift-Kelce love story. How did this all start?PRINCIOTTI: So it started in July, when Travis Kelsey went to one of Taylor's Eras Tour shows when she was in Kansas City. And he did something that a lot of Swift fans have done at the Eras Tour, which is that he made and wore and brought a friendship bracelet. And he did a funny thing, which is that he put his phone number...CHANG: Oh, nice move.PRINCIOTTI: ...On a friendship bracelet. I know - very savvy. And he tried to get it to Taylor but was unsuccessful. Then he told the story of not getting through the inner circle on his podcast with his brother, who's another NFL player. And then the rumors start. But that was what seeded some form of communication between the two of them that ended in Taylor accepting Travis' invitation to show up at Arrowhead Stadium to see the Chiefs play the Bears on Sunday.CHANG: In perfect Chiefs colors. OK, well, Swifties are famously passionate about the pop star. Football fans are also famously passionate about their teams. Can you just compare these two fandoms for me? Like, is knowing your favorite NFL player's stats kind of like being able to identify all the little Easter eggs that Taylor is known to hide in her songs?PRINCIOTTI: It sort of is for two groups that I think in some ways don't identify as having very much in common with each other. There is an enthusiasm and a detail orientation and an obsessive quality that definitely...CHANG: I love it. They're colliding now.PRINCIOTTI: Yeah, it's really great. There's a couple key differences, though. One is that NFL players, for the scope of the NFL writ large - you know, it's the biggest American professional sport - the players themselves can be relatively anonymous when they play. You can't really see their faces. There's 53 guys on every roster. It's not the same type of superstardom that you find even in other sports and definitely not in pop music.CHANG: I want to know. What about the NFL in all of this? - because as we mentioned, sales for Travis Kelce's jersey have apparently skyrocketed. And that could very well be because of Taylor's fans. And I saw that many of the post-game questions were about Taylor Swift's appearance at the game. The commentators were all talking about it. Is Taylor Swift going to be awesome or terrible for the NFL and the future of football? What do you think?PRINCIOTTI: Well, I suppose that remains to be seen. I do think in general, the NFL is incredibly excited about getting a piece of the Taylor spotlight. You could already tell over the summer because the Eras Tour concerts - they were all in NFL stadiums. And the football team that played in whatever stadium she was visiting - their social media account, their whole operation would bend over backwards to come up with something that, you know, allowed them to sort of connect with the Taylor Swift fan base. So the NFL, which does want to improve its exposure and appeal to women especially, I think is thrilled about this.CHANG: That is Nora Princiotti, staff writer for The Ringer and host of Every Single Album, a pop music podcast.
